High Temperature or High Pressure Method\\nThe synthesis of bulk black phosphorus (BP) can be traced back to 1914 when Bridgman converted white phosphorus (WP) into bulk BP under high temperature (200 °C) and high hydrostatic pressure (1.2-1.3 GPa).[24] The density of the obtained bulk BP is 2.69 kg m−3, which is much higher than that of ordinary WP (1.83 kg m−3) and red phosphorus (RP) (2.05-2.34 kg m−3). Unlike WP and RP, BP shows high chemical stability; it does not ignite spontaneously when exposed to air and is also not easily ignited by a match. Additionally, it can be heated to approximately 400 °C in air without spontaneous ignition. However, the transition from WP to BP is not very complete, resulting in a small amount of RP formed during the preparation process and a slight quantity of WP remaining untransformed. Thus, the obtained BP crystal is not the purest. Furthermore, low yield and harsh reaction conditions are other shortcomings of this method.\\n\\nBridgman further explored another route to synthesize bulk BP by directly transforming RP into BP under room temperature, but this method required higher pressure (8.0 GPa).[85] Later, Shirotani applied high-pressure equipment to fabricate larger single crystalline BP with a diameter of 4 nm and length of 5 nm under a pressure of 2.3 GPa and temperature of 500 °C.[86] Shoichi et al. also employed RP as a precursor to prepare BP under low pressure (1 GPa) but high temperature (900 °C).[87] However, all of these high temperature or high pressure methods are difficult for most laboratories to prepare bulk BP.', 'sim_score': 0.6748739486966205}]")]

Synthesis of CsPbBr3 with no ligands via the co-precipitation method at room temperature\\nCsPbBr3 nanocrystals were synthesized via the co-precipitation method according to the literature with some modifications [14]. In a typical experiment, 0.004 mmol of CsBr, and 0.004 mmol of PbBr2 was added to 10 ml of anhydrous DMF. The solution was ultrasonicated for 1 h or until all precursors dissolved in the solution.

Conclusions\\nIn this work, we demonstrated the usefulness of olive oil and oleylamine as the surface ligand system (vs. the typical oleic acid and oleylamine mixtures) for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals at room temperature. For this purpose, the supersaturated recrystallization process was employed, enabling a direct synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals. \\n\\nFirst, according to XRD, the crystallite size is ~40-42 nm in both conditions (oleic acid and oleylamine vs. olive oil and oleylamine), whereas the latter system allows for a less orientational order than the former by showing a partial amorphous halo. The TEM images confirmed that the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have a cuboid shape in line with XRD data exhibiting a cubic phase. The UV-Vis absorption data exhibited that the optical bandgap of CsPbBr3 is about 2.3 eV in both ligand systems. The PL emission spectra indicated that FWHM is about 19 nm (olive oil and oleylamine) vs. 21 nm (oleic acid and oleylamine), which falls into the desirable FWHM values, i.e., ~12-42 nm for technical applications. Finally, the average PL lifetime is 3.228 ns for olive oil and oleylamine and 1.167 ns for oleic acid and oleylamine.\\n\\nFuture work may include the application of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals to biosensors and optoelectronic devices.\', \'sim_score\': 0.958427556870271}, {\'index\': \'reference_2\', \'paper_title\': \'Water-Assisted Size and Shape Control of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals.md\', \'para_content\': \'(DMF, $99.8\\\\%$ )was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich \\n\\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs. As illustrated in Figure S1, the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs was carried out at room temperature by LARP approach, through injection of 1 mL of precursor mixture (which we denote by a generic term “precursor” further on) into a “bad solvent’ toluene ( $10\\\\,\\\\mathrm{\\\\mL}$ ）under vigorous stirring(Figure S1b).

When investigating the influence of water added to the “bad solvent", 1 mL of the dry precursor was injected into a mixture of toluene and water $(10~\\\\mathrm{mL}+x$ μL, $0{\\\\le}x{\\\\le}60)$ (Figure Slc).

However, the whole hot injection experiment requires air isolation and relatively high temperature.

Owing to using ZrO2 coated CsPbBr3 NCs, the prepared CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs not only present a PLQY of 80% but also exhibit an enhanced stability to heat and moisture. Furthermore, WLEDs are fabricated with CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs and commercial red phosphors (CaAlSiN3:Eu2+) on blue LEDs chips.
