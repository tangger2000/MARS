The retrieved references contain several methodologies for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals at room temperature, including co-precipitation methods, ligand-assisted approaches, and ZrO2-coating strategies. Notable details from each reference are as follows:

1. **Reference 0**:
   - Describes a co-precipitation method for synthesizing CsPbBr3 nanocrystals at room temperature.
   - The procedure involves dissolving 0.004 mmol of CsBr and 0.004 mmol of PbBr2 in anhydrous DMF, ultrasonication for 1 hour, and subsequent addition of the precursor solution to toluene.

2. **Reference 1**:
   - Employs supersaturated recrystallization at room temperature with alternative ligand systems (olive oil and oleylamine vs. oleic acid and oleylamine) to synthesize CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.
   - Notes the crystallite size (~40–42 nm), optical properties, and photoluminescence data.

3. **Reference 2**:
   - Utilizes a ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) methodology.
   - The precursor mixture includes CsBr, PbBr2, oleylamine, and oleic acid dissolved in DMF, which is injected into toluene under stirring.

4. **Reference 3**:
   - Introduces a zirconia-coated strategy for CsPbBr3@ZrO2 nanocrystals at room temperature.
   - Highlights improved stability and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 80%.

### Analysis:
The most straightforward and optimal method for synthesizing CsPbBr3 nanocrystals at room temperature is Reference 0, focusing on the co-precipitation method due to the simplicity and feasibility of the process without complex ligand or stabilization requirements.

I will now construct a detailed synthesis scheme for CsPbBr3 nanocrystals based on the co-precipitation method from Reference 0.
