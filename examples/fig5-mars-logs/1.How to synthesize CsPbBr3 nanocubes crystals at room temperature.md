Let's streamline the process by consulting directly with the Synthesis Scientist for a simplified synthesis protocol at room temperature. Once we receive the synthesis protocol, we can further determine the specific steps needed, including encoding the synthesis scheme into JSON/XML and visualizing it if necessary.

To synthesize CsPbBr3 nanocubes crystals at room temperature, we can refer to the methods outlined in some recent studies. The synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) involves the ligand-assisted reprecipitation approach, which is conducted under ambient conditions. By analyzing the various references, we can construct a comprehensive synthesis scheme. Let's choose the relevant synthesis approach from your references and create a detailed experimental plan.

### Reference for Synthesis:

This involves the preparation of a precursor mixture of CsBr, PbBr2, oleylamine (OLA), oleic acid (OA), and using DMF as a solvent. The precursor is then injected into toluene under vigorous stirring to form the nanocrystals.

6. **Step-by-Step Process for Final Material Synthesis**:
   - **Step 1**: Dissolve 0.4 mmol of CsBr and 0.4 mmol of PbBr2 in 10 mL DMF in reaction beaker C001.
   - **Step 2**: Add 0.5 mL of OLA and 1.0 mL of OA to the mixture to fully dissolve solids.
   - **Step 3**: Rapidly inject 1 mL of this precursor into 10 mL of dry toluene in the injection container C002, ensuring vigorous stirring using E001 set to 1500 rpm.

7. **Characterization of Synthesized Material**:
   - Monitor the formation of nanocrystals via UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy.
   - Confirm structure using X-ray diffraction patterns.

8. **Additional Considerations**:
