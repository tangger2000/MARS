How to synthesis CsPbBr3@SiO2 at room temperature?
# ---------- TextMessage (ORCHESTRATOR) ----------
To synthesize CsPbBr3@SiO2 at room temperature, we need to break down the task into manageable subtasks and assign them to the appropriate sub-teams. Here's the plan:

| Team_name   | Member_name       | sub-task                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scientist   | Synthesis Scientist | Provide a detailed synthesis procedure for CsPbBr3@SiO2 at room temperature |
Next sub-task:
1. Scientist : Synthesis Scientist - Provide a detailed synthesis procedure for CsPbBr3@SiO2 at room temperature

START
# ---------- ThoughtEvent (Scientist_Admin) ----------

We are given a plan that breaks down the task into multiple sub-tasks with different teams and members.
 The first sub-task is: "Scientist : Synthesis Scientist - Provide a detailed synthesis procedure for CsPbBr3@SiO2 at room temperature"
 Since I am the scientist coordinator and I have the Synthesis_Scientist agent for such tasks, I will handoff to the Synthesis_Scientist.
 However, note that the plan also includes other steps (like converting to JSON, visualization, etc.) but those are for other teams (Engineer, Executor, Analyst). 
 Our role as the scientist coordinator is to handle the scientific part, specifically the synthesis procedure.

 Therefore, I will handoff to the Synthesis_Scientist to get the detailed synthesis procedure.

 Important: The user's question is "How to synthesis CsPbBr3@SiO2 at room temperature?" and the first step in the plan is to get the synthesis procedure from the Synthesis Scientist.

 Let's call the tool to handoff to the Synthesis_Scientist.

- **PLQY**: Expected ~71.6% (vs. 46% for uncoated QDs).  
- **TEM**: Verify core-shell morphology.  

---

### **Key Notes**  
- **Stability**: SiO₂ coating improves thermal stability (84% PL retention after 60°C/80 min).  
- **Scalability**: One-pot method is facile and scalable.  
- **Safety**: Use gloves (PbBr₂ is toxic); work in a fume hood.  

This method ensures **high PLQY (71.6%)** and **enhanced stability** for applications like LEDs or lasers. Let me know if you need modifications!
