Conclusion\\nThe seed mediated method is used to synthesize good quality Au nanorods in this study. The stability of Au seeds and nanorods in aqueous solution is sensitive to several factors such as aging time and surrounding media. This study shows that the seeds can grow to a nearly uniform size after 1 month, and the (S2h) Au seeds rather than the (10 day) (S10d) or the (30 day) (S30d) seeds can be used for synthesizing good quality Au nanorods with a high yield (≥90%). The introduction of chloroform can cause both a red shift in the plasmon band position and a decrease in absorption intensity due to the surface charge decrease of Au nanorods.\', \'sim_score\': 0.9911279491926537}, 
  
  {\'index\': \'reference_2\', \'paper_title\': \'Anisotropic Metal Nanoparticles-Synthesis Assembly and Optical Applications (1).md\', \'para_content\': \'"Green" Synthesis Of Metallic Nanorods With Tunable Aspect Ratio\\nWe have developed a seed-mediated growth method to make gold and silver nanorods and nanowires of controllable aspect ratio up to a limit.[66, 68, 72, 94, 99] The basic approach is shown in Figure 2. The reactions take place in air, in water, at room temperature, and, in principle, are amenable to scaling up. Metal salts are reduced in water, in air, at room temperature, with a strong reducing agent (sodium borohydride) to yield 3.5-4 nm spherical "seed" particles. These faceted nanospheres appear to be single crystalline[96] and can be capped with a variety of surface groups (citrate, surfactants, etc.) that could be present during the reaction.\\n\\nAs the seeds "age," in order for any excess borohydride to react with water, growth solutions containing more metal salt, a structure directing agent, and a weak reducing agent are prepared in a separate flask. The weak reducing agent is usually ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and by itself, at room temperature, is not capable of fully reducing the metal salt all the way to the elemental metal; but upon addition of the seeds, the reaction is thought to take place on the seed surface and be autocatalytic, to produce larger nanoparticles. The presence of the structure directing agent is crucial to obtaining nanorods, as opposed to larger nanospheres; in our case, we have found that cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is uniquely suited to produce rods. More details on the mechanism will be explored below.\\n\\nFor reasons not presently understood, gold nanorods starting from ∼3.5-4 nm spherical seeds can grow out to 20-30 nm wide and up to 600 nm long, and no more. Aspect ratio, length divided by width, varies from ∼2 to ∼25 and is controlled by the relative concentrations of reagents. For silver, nanowires up to a dozen microns long can be made, with little control once the reaction takes off; these wires have a diameter within several nanometers of 30 nm.[66, 102]\', \'sim_score\': 0.9604209673042773},

  {\'index\': \'reference_4\', \'paper_title\': \'Seeded High Yield Synthesis of Short Au Nanorods in Aqueous Solution.md\', \'para_content\': \'We have reported the synthesis of gold and silver nanorods/wires with relatively high aspect ratios by aqueous seeded and non-seeded growth methods. The synthesis relies on the reduction of metal salt by a weak reducing agent in the presence of preformed metallic seed particles. On the basis of electron diffraction analysis and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have proposed a mechanism in which gold nanorods evolve by the symmetry breaking of face-centered cubic metallic structures by preferential adsorption of capping agents to different crystal faces to produce anisotropic penta-twinned particles. Recently, Gai and Harmer and Xia et al. studied similar systems and gathered further evidence supporting this mechanism of rod evolution. To make gold nanorods, we have shown that the use of silver nitrate in the seeded synthesis method improved the yield as well as subtly changed the shape of gold nanorods. Similar observations were previously made in the electrochemical synthesis of Au rods. Nikoobakht and El Sayed obtained Au rods of varied aspect ratio in solution by varying the amount of silver nitrate for a given amount of gold. They reported a very high yield of Au nanorods when they used surfactant-stabilized Au seeds. Here, we extended the above methods to produce a very high yield of short Au nanorods of average lengths ranging from 20 to 100 nm in a controllable manner. We carried out a systematic study to observe the influence of various reaction parameters on the rod dimension. We have shown that in addition to the concentration ratio of Au seed to Au3+ ions, the reducing agent (L-ascorbic acid, AA) and capping agent played important roles in controlling the aspect ratio as well as the yield of Au nanorods. We also report on the light scattering properties of both short and long nanorods, as observed by dark-field microscopy.\\n\\nTable 1.
