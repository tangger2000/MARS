Then,  the sealed reactor was placed into a muffle furnace and heated to   $\\ 780\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  to completely dissolve the raw materials. After being held for   $\\mathsf{\\Omega}_{\\mathsf{P}}{\\mathsf{h}}$   at   $\\,^{1}80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C},$   the solution was slowly cooled down to room temperature. The  obtained crystals were rinsed in ethanol and dried for further use.  \n\nGrowth of   $M A_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}$   Single Crystals : The growth of   $\\mathsf{M A}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   single  crystals was achieved by evaporating solvent of the saturated solution,  which was prepared by a stoic hio metric mixture of 3 mmol   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{B r}$  and 2 mmol   ${\\mathsf{B i B r}}_{3}$   dissolving in   $\\mathsf{I5~m L}$   methanol anhydrous. To control  the speed of crystal growth, the container was sealed with parafilm with  a few small holes.  \n\nSynthesis of   $C s_{3}B i_{2}X_{9}$   QDs : In a typical synthesis of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QDs,  0.2 mmol CsBr and 0.134 mmol   ${\\mathsf{B i B r}}_{3}$   as well as   $33~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   OLAm were  dissolved in   $3\\,\\mathrm{\\Delta}m\\mathrm{L}$   DMSO to form a clear precursor solution.   $0.5~\\mathrm{{mL}}$  precursor solution was slowly dropped into a mixture of   $5~\\mathsf{m L}$   ethanol  and  $0.5~{\\mathsf{r n L}}$   OA with vigorous stirring at  $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
