Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Very recently, concerning HMHPs, Delugas, and co-workers  investigated  MA fragmentation. First, the electronic structure and energy  levels of each chemical and ionic bonding states of the MA  cation were investigated. The DOS of the electronic state of  the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation in the ideal   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   structure has been calculated, as shown in  Figure    6 .

The zero energy is set to the valence band maximum. To better visualize the molecular levels, they are  plotted in separate panels, one for each atom type. Top panel: total DOS (green). Bottom panels: projected DOS of the atomic states of the  $\\mathsf{M}\\mathsf{A}^{+}$   cation.  HC and HN are hydrogen atoms bound to C and N, respectively.

In particular, amine groups display localized lone-pair HOMO and LUMO orbitals well into the bandgap. d) Endothermic DTA  peaks for the decomposition reaction of   $\\mathsf{M A P b X}_{3}$   crystals. In the case of  $\\mathsf{M A P b B r}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$  , the endothermic peak of the decomposition event convolutes with the endothermic peak of the melting process of the corresponding lead halide; hence, the contribution of each process was separated by  a peak fitting procedure (sum of gaussians). The “shape index” of each decomposition peak was used to obtain the order of reaction. a–c) Reproduced  with permission.  Copyright 2015, American Physical Society. d) Reproduced with permission.

The   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   bond is broken in route (c). The large formation energies  are related to the low concentration of localized defects, but  the final products of dissociation result from non equilibrium  solution processing. They are also produced under ultraviolet  irradiation and are very stable. These products create point  defects such as vacancies, interstitial defects, and substitutions.  \n\nThe dissociation of MAI to   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}–\\mathrm{I}$   can occur via  route (a). The dissociated   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$   has three electrons in an equal  number of   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   bonds and has another two in the lone-pair  HOMO with an   $\\mathrm{N}(2\\mathrm{p})$   orbital character. On the other hand,   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$   is highly electronegative. Hence, it migrates and reacts  with I. The   $_{\\mathrm{C-I}}$   bond axis in the formed   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}–\\mathrm{I}$   (io do methane)  complex  is parallel to the   $\\mathrm{PbI_{4}}$   unit. In route (b), the dissociated MA forms stable   $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$   (methane in Figure 6b), and   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  can migrate/react with   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   ions.
