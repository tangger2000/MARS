Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In the case of rhombic orientation, the  ortho rhombi c   $^{a\\cdot}$   and   $b$  -axes are parallel to diagonals contained  inside the faces of the same pseudo cubic axes, whereas the parallel orientation means that the ortho rhombi c axes are parallel  to the pseudo cubic directions.  The high-temperature   $_\\mathrm{T-C}$  ,   $\\mathrm{O_{2}-T,}$   and   ${\\mathrm{M}}_{3}\\mathrm{-O}_{1}$   phase transitions are related to oxygen octahedron tilting.

Thus, the ability to tailor the phase transition behavior and associated properties through compositional modification is significant  for the energy storage density   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   in   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$  -based ceramics.  \n\nIn this research, we did comprehensive study on the phase  diagram of   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   solid solution and found that the  Ta addition in   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   would effectively shift the   $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$   and   ${{\\bf{M}}_{3}}$    phases to lower temperature,  thus enhanced the antiferroelectricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   materials. This was confirmed by  polarization hysteresis, dielectric tunability, and selected-area  electron diffraction (SAED) measurements. As expected, the  anti ferroelectric feature leads to the reduced   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$  and enhanced   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}/E_{\\mathrm{A}}$  . In addition, the Ta in  $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb,Ta)O}_{3}$   solid solution results  in decreased grain size and increased bulk density, accounts for  the increased dielectric breakdown strength. All these parameters contribute to the enhanced energy storage density, with   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   being on the order of   $4.2\\ \\mathrm{J\\cm^{-3}}$  , a   $260\\%$   enhancement  over the pure counterpart. This is by far the highest energy  density ever achieved in lead-free AFE materials. Of particular  importance is that a good thermal stability of the energy storage  density, with minimal variation   $({<}{\\pm}5\\%)$   over temperature range  of   ${20}–120\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , is also achieved, demonstrating high potential of \n\n  $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb,Ta)O}_{3}$   ceramics for dielectric energy storage application.  \n\nFigure   1  gives the representative hysteresis loops of the \n\n  $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   solid solution, where Ta-doped ceramics show  larger integral area (the blue line region) than that of the pure  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/0075bfd23b2f2eecb280ba3d00c3ce2325f667b35d4c720c4286be3ad357e6a3-1727114995.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   a) Hysteresis loops of  $\\mathsf{A g N b O}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{0.85}\\mathsf{T a}_{0.15})\\,\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   ceramic. b) Energy storage performance of   $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{1-x}\\mathsf{T a}_{x})\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   ceramics prior to their  breakdown. c) Temperature stability of   $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{0.85}\\mathsf{T a}_{0.15})\\,\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   ceramic. d) Energy storage performance of recently reported lead-free ceramics, in which  ANT15 is  $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{0.85}\\mathsf{T a}_{0.15})\\mathsf{O}_{3};$  ; ANM0.1 is  $\\mathsf{A g N b O}_{3}.0.1$   w  $\\mathsf{i}\\%\\mathsf{M n O}_{2}^{[14]}$  ; AN is  $\\mathsf{A g N b O}_{3}^{[15]}$  ; BNT–KNN is  $0.84(\\mathsf{B i}_{0.5}\\mathsf{N a}_{0.5})\\mathsf{T i O}_{3}-0.16(\\mathsf{K}_{0.5}\\mathsf{N a}_{0.5})\\,\\mathsf{N b O}_{3}{}^{[24]},$  ; BNT– BT–KNN is   $0.89(\\mathsf{B i}_{0.5}\\mathsf{N a}_{0.5})\\mathsf{T i O}_{3}-0.06\\mathsf{B a}\\mathsf{T i O}_{3}-0.05(\\mathsf{K}_{0.5}\\mathsf{N a}_{0.5})\\mathsf{N b O}_{3}{}^{[25]}$  ; KNN–ST is   $0.85(\\mathsf{K}_{0.5}\\mathsf{N a}_{0.5})\\mathsf{N b O}_{3}-0.15\\mathsf{S r T i O}_{3}{}^{[26]}$  ; BF–BT–BMN is   $0.61\\,\\mathrm{Bi}\\,\\mathrm{FeO}_{3^{-}}$   $0.338{\\sf a T i O}_{3}-0.068{\\sf a}\\,({\\sf M g}_{1/3}{\\sf N b}_{2/3})\\,{\\sf O}_{3}{}^{[27]};$  ; BT–BMN is   $0.858a\\mathsf{T i O}_{3}-0.158\\mathsf{i}(\\mathsf{M}\\mathsf{g}_{2/3}\\mathsf{N b}_{1/3})\\mathsf{O}_{3}{}^{[28]}$  ] ; BNBT–KN is   $0.948\\mathsf{i}_{0.47}\\mathsf{N a}_{0.47}\\mathsf{B a}_{0.06}\\mathsf{T i O}_{3}-0.06\\mathsf{K N b O}_{3}{}^{[29]}$  ; BST  is   $\\mathsf{B a}_{0.4}\\mathsf{S r}_{0.6}\\mathsf{T i O}_{3}\\!\\!-\\!\\!5\\ \\mathsf{v o l\\%}(\\mathsf{B a}\\mathsf{O}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathsf{S i O}_{2}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathsf{B}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3})^{[30]}$  ; BF–BT–Nb is  $0.97(0.658\\mathsf{i F e O}_{3}\\!\\!-\\!\\!0.35\\mathsf{B a T i O}_{3})\\!-$   $0.03\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{5}$  .  \n\nTable 1.   Properties of   $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{1-x}\\mathsf{T a}_{x})\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   ceramics. \n\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
