Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

These results  reveal that the charge recombination is effectively reduced by  reduced trap density,  another reason for higher performance  of the MAPbI 3 –DS device.  \n\nUp to now, all high efficiency F-PSCs reported in literature are based on very small area   $(<\\!0.1\\:\\mathrm{~cm}^{2})$   devices, it is still challenging to manufacture the large area F-PSCs  with high PCE. Therefore, we fabricated F-PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$   absorbers with larger area.  Figure   5 a shows the   $J{-}V$  curves of the F-PSCs based on different areas, with key  parameters summarized in Table 1, and device photographs  are shown in the insets. The flexible device with an area of   $0.2\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   offers PCE of   $16.65\\%$   with  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $22.29\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  of   $1.088\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , and FF of 0.688. When the device is expanded to   $1.2\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{2}$  , PCE drops to   $13.35\\%$  . Even though these efficiencies are the highest reported to date for their respective large  area of F-PSCs, detailed analysis is needed to improve the  efficiency in large area cells. It is clear that when the area is  expanded to   $1.2~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   remains the same at   $1.008\\,\\mathrm{~V},$   the  PCE loss is from the significant losses in   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF. These  losses are apparently caused by the series resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{s}})$  that is increased by a factor of 2 (Table 1). When PET/ITO is  improved with higher conductivity,   $R_{s}$   will be decreased and  both   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF will benefit. It is expected that optimized  device design and improved PET/ITO will lead to higher large  area PCE. Figure 5b shows the incident photon-to-charge  conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the integrated current  of the IPCE curves with the AM 1.5G photon flux for the  flexible devices with different active areas. The calculated   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  values by integrating the IPCE curves are 22.35, 21.63, and \n\n  $20.27\\:\\mathrm{\\mA}\\:\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$   corresponding to areas of 0.052, 0.2, and \n\n  $1.2\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  , respectively, very close to the  $J{-}V$  measurements. The  high PCE of large area F-PSCs indicates that the MAPbI 3 –DS  films are very uniform in large area. With proper design in  large area devices to ensure controlled   $R_{s}$  , it is expected that  the PCE of large area devices would be further enhanced.  \n\nIn conclusion, the effective DS additive has been successfully developed to improve the PCE of F-PSCs.

Careful  $J{-}V$  analysis shows that the large area cell gives identical   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   as the small area cells, with proper design of large area  device to ensure controlled   $R_{s}$  , it is expected that the PCE of  large area cell may be significantly increased. In addition, the  environmental stability of the F-PSCs is significantly improved  when the DS additive is used. The excellent performance of  the   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}–\\mathrm{DS}}$   flexible devices is attributed to large grain  size and good crystal lin it y of the resultant perovskite absorber  layer, thanks to the decreased Gibbs free energy and slowed  down growth rate for perovskite crystallization process when   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   forms chelated intermediate with DS. It is expected that  the present strategy will help guide development of large-scale  F-PSCs for practical applications.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : MAI was synthesized and purified according to the  previous reported procedure.
