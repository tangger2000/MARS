Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The increased grain size  and improved compactness and smoothness are put down to  suppressed heterogeneous nucleation resulting from enhanced  hydrophobic it y of crystal substrates. Improved morphology  should be conducive to facilitating carrier transport and supÂ­ pressing charge non radiative recombination.  \n\nThe crystal structure and crystal lin it y of the perovskite layer  were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The diffraction peak  positions and intensities of modified perovskite films did not  change compared with the control films, indicating that the  crystal structure and crystal lin it y were almost not affected by  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/34b551366d18551be8f6db8693d285b62930f5c55e4ba7e2d3ded6b1ab0acb10-1727104857.jpg)  \nFigure   3.â  a) XRD patterns of the perovskite films deposited on pristine and modified  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   films with AD, ADCA, and ADAA.

Similar crystal lin it y  and orientation were also demonstrated for control and modiÂ­ fied perovskite films by Grazing wide-angle X-ray scattering  (GIWAXS) in FigureÂ  S5 (Supporting Information). Depthdependent grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measÂ­ urements were performed to study the stress distribution of the  control and modified perovskite films. First, we chose varied  incident angles  Ï  (  $\\omega=0.3$  , 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, and   $1.5^{\\circ})$  ) to  ensure that the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}/$  perovskite interface could be detected. As  exhibited in FigureÂ 3bâe, the diffraction peaks of all perovskite  films were gradually shifted toward lower angles as the inciÂ­ dent angles increased, which was indicative of the existence of  tensile stress. However, the shift degree gradually reduced in  the order of AD, ADCA, and ADAA as compared to the control  film (FigureÂ  3f). The reduced strain could be due to reduced  inter facial defects and ameliorated inter facial contact.   Since ADAA molecule is the most effective in inter facial defect  healing, the smallest stress was achieved in ADAA-modified  perovskite films among all investigated samples.  \n\nFrom UVâvis absorption spectra in FigureÂ  S6 (Supporting  Information), similar absorption intensity was observed for the  control and modified perovskite films. We measured the steadystate photo luminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved photolumiÂ­ nescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films deposited on  glass substrates. Compared with the control perovskite film, the  PL intensity and carrier lifetimes were enhanced after interface  modification no matter which direction the fluorescence spectra  were tested ( Figure Â   4 aâd). Nevertheless, much higher carrier  lifetimes can be found upon measuring from glass side as comÂ­ pared to from perovskite side. It suggests that as-used modifiers  can efficaciously passivate the defects at the bottom surface of  perovskite films and suppress trap-assisted non radiative recomÂ­ bination. In the case of glass side, the average carrier lifetime of  perovskite films was increased from 230.74Â ns in pristine perovÂ­ skite films to 361.11, 687 .35, and 746.58Â ns after AD, ADCA, and  ADAA modification, respectively (TableÂ  S1, Supporting InforÂ­ mation). Meanwhile, for perovskite side, the average carrier  lifetime (210.08Â ns) of the control perovskite film was increased  after the modification of AD (245.01Â ns), ADCA (250.34Â ns), and  ADAA (276.52Â ns) (TableÂ S2, Supporting Information). The PL  mapping result in FigureÂ 4eâh is in good accordance with that  of the above single-point SSPL. Subsequently, the trap density  of the control and modified perovskite films was calculated by  performing the space charge limited current (SCLC) test for the  electron-only devices (FigureÂ 4iâl). The defect density was calcuÂ­ lated as our previous studies.  The trapâfilled limit voltage \n\n  $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$   of the control device was   $0.49\\,\\mathrm{~V},$   which was reduced to \n\n 0.39, 0.35, and   $0.33\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$  for the AD, ADCA, and ADAA modiÂ­ fied devices, respectively. Much lower defect densities were  obtained in the AD   $(6.78\\times10^{15})$  , ADCA   $(6.09\\times10^{15})$  , and ADAA   $(5.74\\,\\times\\,10^{15}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})$  ) modified perovskite films than the control  perovskite film   $(8.52\\,\\times\\,10^{15}\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})$  . The above PL and SCLC  results show that AD, ADCA, and ADAA interface molecules  can effectively passivate the defects at the bottom surface and/or  GBs of perovskite films. Moreover, the defect pass iv ation effect  was gradually increased from AD, ADCA to ADAA, which is  positively correlated with chemical interaction strengths. Both  defect pass iv ation effect and chemical interaction strengths are  negatively correlated with the steric hindrance of the chemical  interaction between   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   in modifiers and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  . In a word,  tunable defect pass iv ation effect was achieved by modulating  the steric hindrance of modification molecules and thus interÂ­  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/09689c04152de201a5a95e480a13d41a35099ab2bc523a6e35c5f089739cc9cf-1727104876.jpg)  \nFigure   4.â  a,c) PL and b,d) TRPL spectra of the perovskite films deposited on glass substrates without and with modifier.

Certainly, increased carÂ­ rier lifetimes and reduced defect density are partially attributed  to slightly enlarged grain size and improved morphology.  \n\nUVâvis absorption spectra of the  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   films without and with  AD, ADCA, and ADAA modification are shown in FigureÂ   $S7a$    (Supporting Information).
