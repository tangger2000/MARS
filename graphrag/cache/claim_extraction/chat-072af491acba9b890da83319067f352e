Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

This is one of the highest efficiencies reported for inorganic PVSCs (Figure S1 and Table S1,  Supporting Information). The optimized thickness for PN4N  was   ${\\approx}8\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . The device efficiency dropped dramatically with  further increasing or decreasing the thickness of PN4N owing  to the increase in electrical resistance in form cases and insufficient polymer coverage on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   in latter cases (Figure S6,  Supporting Information). The enhancement in both   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and  FF resulted in the significant PCE improvement in the   $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2}/$  PN4N-based solar cells. The more favorable energy level alignment at the cathode interface increased the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   by   $0.19\\;\\mathrm{V},$   while  the reduction in leakage and recombination paths improved  the FF.
