{"result": "## COMPLETE", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

The coordination effect of   $\\cdot\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$    and the low surface energy of   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   lead to the crystal  morphology of perovskite films as observed in SEM measurements. By comparing the cross-sectional SEM images of the  devices shown in Figure  2b,d, it is found that the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   preburied with 3AAH layer is   ${\\approx}35$   nm thick with continuous and  compact coverage. This could be advantageous to the suppression of charge recombination at the ETL/PVK interface,  which improves the photovoltaic performance of the devices.  Figure  2e,f show the grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) images of perovskite surface based on different ETLs. Compared with the PVK deposited on the pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   surface, the PVK film deposited on the   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   surface shows the 2D perovskite signal. The integration of detailed  in-plane (along  $\\mathrm{q_{xy}}$  ) direction and out-of-plane (along   $\\mathrm{q_{z}},$  ) direction are demonstrated in Figure  S7a,b (Supporting Information). It is seen that the intensity of the (100) peak in the outof-plane direction becomes stronger than that in the in-plane  direction with 3AAH additive in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , with narrowed full-width  at half-maximum (FWHM). It suggests that the PVK on 3AAH $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   is preferentially arranged in the out-of-plane direction,  which benefits the charge transport. In addition, PVK deposited  on  $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   surface shows 2D phase in the direction of outof-plane (along   $\\mathrm{q_{z,}}$  ), which is consistent with the previous test  results. This further proves that 3AAH treatment can regulate  the crystallographic direction of PVK crystal. And it suggests  that the PVK on   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   is preferentially arranged in the  out-of-plane direction, which benefits the charge transport.  \n\nIt has been well acknowledged that residual tensile stress would  be generated in the PVK film during annealing-cooling process,  due to the mismatch between thermal expansion coefficient  of PVK film and the substrate, which is detrimental to the  device performance and stability.  The residual stresses in  PVK layers on different ETLs are thus characterized by depthresolved grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with   $2\\theta\\mathrm{sin}^{2}\\psi$  measurement, where   $\\theta$  represents the diffraction and   $\\psi$   represents tilting angles.  As   $\\psi$   increases from  $10^{\\circ}$   to   $50^{\\circ}$    in  Figure   3 a, the scattering peak of pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$   gradually shifts to a lower angle direction, implying an increase in  the crystal plane distance and the presence of tensile stress in  the PVK film. At this point, the slope of the   $2\\theta\\mathrm{sin}^{2}\\psi$  linear fit  is negative (Figure 3c). However, Figure 3b shows that the PVK  film coated on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL with pre-buried 3AAH exhibits the  opposite trend. As   $\\psi$   increases, the diffraction peaks have a tendency to move toward higher degree with a positive slope of the  linear fit of   $2\\theta\\!\\sin^{2}\\!\\psi,$   suggesting that the PVK has released its  tensile stress and transited into a slight compressive strain.   Based on the equation   $\\sigma_{\\Delta T}=\\frac{E_{P}}{1\\!-\\!\\nu_{P}}\\,(\\alpha_{s}-\\alpha_{p})\\Delta T$  , where   $\\sigma$  is the  stress and   $\\alpha$   is the thermal expansion coefficient, the   $\\alpha$  of ETL  becomes larger after the addition of 3AAH. After depositing the  perovskite film on ETL, the contraction of the perovskite film  \n\nincreases during the annealing process, resulting in compressive strain. In addition, we speculate that it might be due to the  2D layer formed on the lower surface of the film templating the  crystal growth of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   PVK, which leads to a refined crystallization with reduced residual stress. As it has been proven previously that the compressive stress would be advantageous to the  device stability,  our strategy expects to address the long-term  stability issues caused by residual tensile stress.  \n\nThe PVK films deposited on ETL are further tested by  HRTEM, and the lattice is analyzed by fast Fourier transform  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/0ef46b91d2af4d665c456464b10a52c14c204065b3274518c1c1326703813ea3-1727105443.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   GIXRD spectra at different  $\\Psi$   angles (from  $10^{\\circ}$   to  $50^{\\circ}$  ) for a) pristine  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/\\mathsf{P V K}$   and b) w/3AAH  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2I}$  PVK films. c) Linear fit of  $\\cdot2\\theta\\mathrm{sin}^{2}(\\Psi)$   for  perovskite films based on pristine   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and w/3AAH   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL.

From the results shown in Figure 3f,g, the (100) lattice  spacing is extracted to be 6.66 and   $6.{\\bar{44}}\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$   for the pristine   $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2}/$  PVK film and 3AAH $\\mathrm{{·SmO}_{2}/P V K}$   film, respectively. The smaller  lattice spacing further testifies the suppressed tensile stress of  the lattices. Furthermore, the pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$   film shows  a mixture of (111) crystal plane corresponding to   $3.55\\textup{\\AA}$   lattice  spacing and (100) lattice plane corresponding to   $6.66\\textup{\\AA}$   lattice  spacing, while 3AAH  $\\mathrm{{-SnO_{2}/P V K}}$   film exhibits a high phase  purity of (100) lattice plane. It further demonstrates that the  pre-buried 3AAH has positive effect on the crystallographic orientation of PVK.  \n\nTo study the mechanical properties of PVK films with/ without pre-buried 3AAH in   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  , Peak Force Quantitative  Nano mechanical Mapping (PFQNM) is carried out.
