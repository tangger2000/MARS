Compared with the control ﬁlm, the modiﬁed sample was stacked more compactly (Figure  5e,f ) and had a smoother surface (Figure S11 , Supporting Information). The grains within the modiﬁed perovskite ﬁlm spanned the entire thickness of the ﬁlm, whereas the cross-section of the control ﬁlm consisted of smaller grains (Figure  5g,h , Supporting Information). These enhancements in grain size, compactness, and smoothness can be attributed to the suppression of heterogeneous nucleation. The ameliorated morphology was expected to facilitate eﬃcient carrier transport and reduce non radiative charge recombination.  \n\nThe crystal structure and crystal lin it y of the perovskite layer were evaluated through X-ray\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
