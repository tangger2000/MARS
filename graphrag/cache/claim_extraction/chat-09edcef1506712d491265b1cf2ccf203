All parameters were the same in this equation for the cells compared in this study. Thus, the   $N_{\\mathrm{defects}}$   is  proportional to the   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$  . The   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$  of the cell decreased when  introducing the N719 interlayer, indicating a corresponding  decrease in the value of   $N_{\\mathrm{defects}}$  . The results suggest that the  surface trap states of the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD were passivated by the N719 dye, which is in consist en ce with the EIS  results in Figure 3b.  \n\nTo investigate the charge carrier recombination mechanism  in the devices, the   $J{-}V$  curves of the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  -based PSCs  without and with the N719 interlayer under different light  intensities were measured (Figure  3e).

The increased   $\\alpha$   value of the cell with the  N719 dye interlayer suggests the charge carrier recombination  was suppressed by the introduction of N719 interlayer due to the  fast charge extraction capability. As shown in Figure 3f, the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  values under different light intensities were measured and the  ideality factor  $n$   was obtained according the following formula:  \n\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{oc}}=V_{s}+{\\frac{n K_{b}T}{q}}\\;\\mathrm{ln}\\;{\\frac{I}{I_{s}}}\n$$  \n\n(  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  : the open-circuit voltage under different light intensities;   $V_{\\mathrm{s}}$  : the open-circuit voltage under standard light intensity;   $n$  :  the ideality factor;   $K_{\\mathrm{b}}$  : the Boltzmann constant;  T : the temperature;   $q.$  : the electron charge;  I : the different light intensity;   $I_{s}$  : the standard light intensity). In general, the ideality factor   $n$   trends to unity for ideal solar cells. The calculated   $n$   values  were 2.31 and 1.87 for the devices without and with the N719  interlayer, respectively, indicating that the introduction of the  N719 interlayer reduced the intrinsic defect density and suppressed the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. Thus,  the increase in the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   value of the cell with the N719 interlayer  can be attributed to the following two aspects. On the one hand,  the introduction of the N719 interlayer between the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$  layer and Spiro-OMeTAD layer led to an appropriate energy  level alignment, accelerating the hole extraction process. On the  other hand, the N719 interlayer passivated the surface defects of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$  , reducing the charge carrier recombination. These  two effects together with the additional sunlight absorption by  the dye then contributed to the enhanced PCE of the cell after  adopting the dye interlayer.  \n\nHumidity sensitivity of PSCs is a big concern for practical  application. The long-term stability of both devices with and  without the dye interlayer was also comparatively studied in  the dry glovebox and in ambient air without encapsulation with  the results shown in  Figure   4 . Both devices stored in   $\\Nu_{2}$  -filled  glove box showed no significant change in the PCE. However,  the PCE of the device without the N719 interlayer decreased to   $75\\%$   of the initial PCE after storage in ambient air for 10 days  (temperature:   ${20}{-}30~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C};$  ; relative humidity:   $30{-}40\\%$  ), which was  resulted from the decreased  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   (Figure S12, Supporting  Information). On the other hand, the device with the N719  interlayer displayed no obvious degradation after storage in  ambient air for 16 days at the same conditions, showing a much  better moisture stability. The N719 interlayer likely hindered  the water molecules to penetrate into the perovskite layer, thus  increasing the moisture resistance of the PSC.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that the introduction of  a multi functional N719 dye interlayer remarkably improved  the PCEs and operational stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$  -based PSCs  simultaneously. The multi functional N719 interlayer broadened the light absorption spectrum, reduced the charge carrier  recombination, accelerated the hole extraction, passivated surface defects, and constructed an appropriate energy level alignment at the same time. As a result, the device optimized with  the N719 interlayer showed a superior PCE of   $2.84\\%$  , which was  much higher than that of the device without the N719 interlayer. This superior PCE value is among the highest PCE values  of double perovskite-based PSCs reported so far. Moreover,  the devices with the N719 interlayer showed a much enhanced  stability under the ambient conditions as compared with the  pristine devices without the N719 interlayer. Our work provides  an effective and convenient strategy for enhancing the PCE  and operational stability of environmentally friendly lead-free   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$  -based PSCs, which can accelerate the commercial ization of PSC technology.  \n\n# 4.
