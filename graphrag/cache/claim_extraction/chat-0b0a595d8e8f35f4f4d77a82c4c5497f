Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The optimal devices exhibit significantly increased  PCE up to   $19.3\\%$   in planar n-i-p devices, as well as slight degradation of only   ${\\approx}13\\%$   after   $40\\textup{d}$   of exposure in   $50\\%$   relative  humidity at room temperature without encapsulation and  high thermal stability under inert atmosphere. The insights  of this work should guide the perovskite community to more  rationally design stable and highly efficient perovskite-based  op to electronic devices.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSolution Preparation : The solution preparation was conducted  under inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen glove box. PCBM (Aldrich),  ITIC (One-material), DTS (One-material), and DR3T (One-material)  molecules in chl oro benzene with concentration varying from 0.4 to   $10\\;\\;\\mathsf{m g}\\;\\;\\mathsf{m L^{-1}}$   were prepared and kept stirred at room temperature  overnight. The   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   precursor solution was prepared in a glove  box in the mixed solvent of DMSO and GBL with volume ratio of 7:3.  The solution was filtered prior to solution-casting. The Spiro-OMeTAD  solution was prepared by dissolving   $90~\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}$   of Spiro-OMeTAD,   $22~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$  of  lithium bis(tri flu oro methane s ulf on yl) imide in acetonitrile, and   $36~\\upmu L$   of  4-tert-but yl pyr i dine in  $1~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of chl oro benzene.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The FTO-coated glass   $(2.5\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}\\,\\times\\,2.5\\,\\mathrm{\\cm})$  ) was  cleaned by sequential sonication in acetone, iso prop an ol, and ethanol  for 30 min each and then dried under   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   flow and treated by ozone  plasma for  $15~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   was prepared by chemical bath deposition  with the clean substrate immersed in a   ${\\sf T i C I}_{4}$   (CP, Sinopharm Chemical  Reagent Co., Ltd) aqueous solution with the volume ratio of   $\\mathsf{T i C l_{4}:H_{2}O}$    equal to 0.0225:1 at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\texttt{l h}$  . The spin-coating was accomplished  under inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen glove box. The procedure was  performed by 1000 r.p.m. for   $\\;\\;10\\;\\mathsf{s}$   followed with 5000 r.p.m. for   $40~\\mathrm{s}$  . At   ${\\approx}25\\ s$   before the last spin-coating step,  $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$   of neat chl oro benzene or  loaded solutions were dropped onto the substrate. The substrates were  then put onto a hotplate for   $10~\\mathsf{m i n}$   at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  . Subsequently, the HTM  were deposited on the top of perovskite by spin-coating at 4000 r.p.m.  for   $\\updownarrow5\\;\\mathsf{s}$   followed by evaporation of   $100\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   gold electrode on the top of  the cell.  \n\nCharacterization—Optical Metrology : UV–Vis absorption spectra were  acquired on a Perkin Elmer UV-Lambda 950 instrument. Steady-state  PL (excitation at   $532~\\mathsf{n m}$  ) and its mapping as well as TRPL (excitation  at   $405\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   and emission at   $760\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathrm{\\,nm}$  ) were measured with Edinburgh  Instruments Ltd (FLS980). FTIR spectroscopy was conducted by using  mid-infrared–far-infrared spectrometer (PE-Frontier).  \n\nCharacterization—Electronic Microscopy : SEM imaging was conducted  on a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; SU-8020,  Hitachi) at an acceleration voltage of 3 kV. TEM operating at   $300~\\mathrm{kV}$    (Titan Cryo Twin, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) was used to acquire  cross-sectional micrographs and EDAX and electron energy-loss  spectroscopy using a   $4\\mathrm{k}\\,\\times\\,4\\mathrm{k}$  charged couple device camera model  US4000. Samples were prepared on a Helios 400s focused ion beam  (FIB; FEI Company), foils were lifted out in situ using an Omniprobe  nano manipulator (Auto Probe 300). Electron beam assisted carbon and  platinum deposition was performed on the sample surface to protect the  thin-film surface against the ion beam bombardment during ion beam  milling. Ga ion beam   $(30~\\mathsf{k V},9~\\mathsf{n A})$   was first used to cut the sample from  the bulk   $(30~\\mathsf{k V},\\,9~\\mathsf{n A})$  ), after which it was attached to a   $\\mathsf{C u}$   grid using a  lift-out method. The sample was subsequently thinned down to  ${\\approx}50$   nm  thickness   $(30~\\mathsf{k V},\\,93~\\mathsf{p A})$   and cleaned   $(2\\;\\mathsf{k V},\\,28\\;\\mathsf{p A})$   to get rid of areas of  the sample damaged during the thinning process. Samples for plan-view  were prepared by floating the thin film in water and picking it up using a  400 mesh copper grid.  \n\nCharacterization—XRD : XRD measurements were carried out in a   $\\scriptstyle\\theta-2\\theta$  configuration with a scanning interval of 2 θ  between   $3^{\\circ}$   and   $45^{\\circ}$   on  a Rigaku Smart Lab (X-ray Source: Cu K  $\\mathcal{X};\\,\\lambda=1.54\\,\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}})$  .  \n\nCharacterization—  $.I n$   situ GIWAXS : In situ GIWAXS measurements  were performed at D-line at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source.  The wavelength of the  $\\mathsf{X}$  -rays was  $1.17\\,\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}$   with a bandwidth  $\\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda$  of  $1.5\\%$  .  The scattering signal was collected by Pilatus 200K detector, with a pixel  size of   $172\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}\\times172\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   placed at   $165.8341~\\mathrm{mm}$   away from the sample  position. The incident angle of the   $\\mathsf X$  -ray beam was at 0.5 degree. The  molecular concentration used here was   $0.8\\,\\mathrm{\\meg\\\\mL^{-1}}$   for both PCBM  and ITIC solutions. Spin-coating experiments were conducted at a  custom-built spin-coating stage with splashing of solvent protected  using kapton tape and controlled from the computer outside the hutch.  The exposure time was kept at   $0.2~s$   to obtain the detailed information  of the process.  \n\nSolar Cell Characterizations : The   $J^{-V}$  performance of the  per ovsk ites solar cells were analyzed by Keithley 2400 source under  ambient condition at room temperature, and the illumination  intensity was   $100\\,\\textrm{\\textmu}\\mathtt{m W}\\,\\textrm{\\textmu}\\mathtt{c m}^{-2}$   (AM 1.5G Oriel solar simulator). The  scan rate was   $0.3\\,\\lor\\,{\\sf s}^{-1}$  . The delay time was   $]0\\ \\mathsf{m s}$  , and the scan  step was 0.02 V. The power output of lamp was calibrated by an  NREL-traceable KG5 filtered silicon reference cell. The device area  of  $0.09\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{2}$   was defined by a metal aperture to avoid light scattering  from the metal electrode into the device during the measurement.
