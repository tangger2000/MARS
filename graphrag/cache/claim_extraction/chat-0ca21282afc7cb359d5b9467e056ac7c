Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The concentration of RCQs used in the  present study was determined from the dependence of the  device performance on the RCQs concentration, which is  shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), where   $1\\;\\mathrm{vol}\\%$  can be seen as the optimal concentration for the highest performance, i.e., the highest PCE, fill factor (FF),   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   and   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}.$  .  The detailed values of these parameters at different RCQs  concentrations are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Figure 4b shows that the champion PSCs based on the  optimized   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   ETL exhibit overall superior performance, with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.14 V,  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $24.1~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and FF of up  to   $83\\%$  , resulting in an outstanding PCE that increases up to   $22.77\\%$   from   $19.15\\%$   for the control PSC based on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  ETL ( Table    1 ). The performance of the control device using  only carbon QDs ETL was also investigated for comparison  (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which is obviously inferior to both devices based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . To our knowledge, the present cells based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs are among the best reported  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/9a2e9722218abfd65f9ec50c4d0a180834ed3b7d2bd6dc613d7e367e6759d015-1723835120.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $(J-V)$   curve for  champion PSCs based on the  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -RCQs ETLs under an illumination of 1 sun (  $\\mathsf{A M~I~.5~G}$  . c)  $J^{-V}$  curves of both champion devices for both  forward and reverse scans. d) Stabilized photo current and steady efficiency of the fabricated PSCs on the   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -RCQs ETL at the maximum power point  output at  $1.0\\,\\lor.$   e) Corresponding EQE curves and integrated current density of the two champion PSCs. f) Normalized PCE of two typical PSCs based  on the two ETLs without encapsulation as functions of time in an ambient dark environment with   $40–60\\%$   relative humidity at  $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .  \n\nn–i–p-based PSCs.  The PCE improvement is obviously  attributed to the enhanced   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}},\\ \\ V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$  derived from the improved film quality and the reduced charge  recombination, respectively. The reduced optical loss cannot  be ruled out in the improvement of   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  owing to the slightly  improved transmission and reduced reflection (Figure S7,  Supporting Information) of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   ETLs. To investigate the charge recombination, we measured the dependence  of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   versus light intensity and   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   versus light intensity for  devices based on both   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and   $\\mathrm{{SnO_{2}}{\\cdot}R C Q s.^{[25]}}$   As shown in  Figure S8a (Supporting Information), the slope of the device  based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   reaches 1.92 and that of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs based  device is only   ${\\approx}1.72$  , indicating that the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   ETL can  significantly reduce trap-assisted recombination in the device.  Moreover, a good linear relationship between   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and light  intensity was observed in both devices, as shown in Figure S8b  (Supporting Information). The slope of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based device  is 0.97, whereas that of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   based device is 0.98,  which is close to 1, indicating that the bimolecular recombination in the devices is almost negligible. The improvement of FF  can be attributed to the high electron mobility of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$  ,  leading to improved charge transport balance and the reduction  of the interface charge accumulation.  \n\nTable 1.   Device performance of champion PSCs based on two ETLs. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/d96bc5dc0e223e5614a65bca7beaf335b9c66b35d75088c5b2618391bd4437db-1723835116.jpg)  \n\nTo further investigate the difference in the hysteresis effect  between the two PSCs, we show the   $J{-}V$  curves of the two  champion PSCs for both forward and reverse scans in Figure 4c  and Table 1. The   $J{-}V$  hysteresis of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$    is clearly significantly reduced to within   ${\\approx}1\\%$  , whereas there  is a much larger effect with the pure   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL. The present  negligible hysteresis in the PSC on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   is most likely  associated with the improved electron mobility of the novel  ETL, which results in more balanced electron and hole extraction and transport.  Moreover, ion migration has been demonstrated to have a serious effect on the hysteresis.  The ion  migration in perovskite films was then confirmed through the  measurement of its activation energy   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$  .  The device structure and the temperature-dependent conductivity of perovskite  films in the activation energy measurement are shown in  Figure S9 (Supporting Information). The ion migration rate  in solid was determined by   $E_{\\mathsf{a}}$   according to the Nernst–Einstein  equation  \n\n$$\n\\sigma(T)\\!=\\!\\frac{\\sigma_{\\scriptscriptstyle0}}{T}\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{K T}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere   $K$   is the Boltzmann constant and   $\\sigma_{0}$   is a constant.   $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$   can  be calculated from the slope of   $\\ln(\\sigma T)-1/k T.$   Ion conductivity  represents how fast ions migrate. The   $E_{\\mathsf{a}}$   of ion conduction  represents how easily ions migrate and can be obtained from  the dependence of conductivity on the temperature in perovskite films.
