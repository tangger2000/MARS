{"result": "## PbI2<|>Perovskite Layer<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>PbI2 serves as a crucial component in the perovskite layer, influencing its properties and performance. The presence of PbI2 affects the absorption, bandgap, and photo luminescence of the perovskite layer. The excess PbI2 can passivate the surface or grain boundary of the perovskite layer, leading to improved performance. The control of PbI2 content in the perovskite layer is achieved by tuning the amount of upper organic salt FAI during the spin-coating process.<|>To control the residual PbI2 contents in perovskite layer, we fixed the thicknesses of PbI2, and tuned the amount of upper organic salt FAI by different spin-coating speeds. Specifically, we fixed the spin-coating speed of PbI2 as 1500 rpm from DMF/DMSO solution, and changed the upper layer of FAI spin-coating speed for 1000, 1300, 1500, and 1700 rpm, respectively. After coating organic salt, the films were annealed at 150°C for 15 min in ambient air to form perovskite layer. The obtained pero layer during measurement in ambient air or unreacted PbI2 at the bottom close to the SnO2 layer where the FAI could not be easily reached. Strong PbI2 diffraction peak for samples B-D confirmed the obvious existence of PbI2, and the diffraction peak of PbI2 is even stronger than that of perovskite for sample D. It was also found that the PbI2 content in perovskite layer influences the absorption and also the bandgap obviously (Figure 2b). Perovskite with PbI2 deficient (sample A) showed the smallest bandgap, and the bandgap of perovskite was slightly shifted to wide bandgap direction while the PbI2 contents in the perovskite layer were increased. It can be easily explained that in the perovskite layers, there are two phases coexisted, i.e., FAPbI3 and PbI2, the PbI2 phase comes from the decomposed perovskite. It was suggested that PbI2 could form type II band alignment with perovskite, and the excess PbI2 could passivate the surface or grain boundary of perovskite layer. Consistent with previous reports, photo luminescence (PL) intensity of perovskite was significantly increased with PbI2 precipitation, and the emission peak was shifted from 789 to 782 nm while increasing the residual PbI2 contents, the PL blueshift is consistent with absorption shift shown in Figure 2b. According to the SEM images (Figure 1b–d) and XRD patterns (Figure 2a), PbI2 and FAD3 phases are two separate phases in the formed films; they have not formed an alloy, and doping could not exist in these systems. The band edge absorption, photo lu minescence, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of FAD3 could not be changed if no other effect happened. The blueshift of vskite film from the combinations of 1500/1000, 1500/1300, 1500/1500, and 1500/1700 are named as sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D, respectively. Correspondingly, the devices made from these perovskite layers are labeled as device A, B, C, and D. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite layers with different compositions are shown in Figure 1. It can be found that all of the samples showed obvious white phase except for sample A. More importantly, the white content was increased gradually with the reduction of FAI, and almost half of surface was covered by white phase for sample D. Previous results have confirmed that the white phases are PbI2, and the black phases are perovskite materials, i.e., the PbI2 formed around the perovskite grain boundary. Cross-section SEM image showed that the PbI2 layer was mainly formed on the perovskite surface (Figure S2, Supporting Information). For two-step spin coating, FAI will first contact with PbI2 surface and perovskite was formed initially at the surface, and it could be safely concluded that the PbI2 we observed on the surface could be mainly from perovskite decomposition by heating. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results shown in Figure 2 a confirmed the same tendency as SEM images demonstrated in Figure 1. For sample A, almost all diffraction peaks were originated from perovskite phase, only a weak PbI2 diffraction peak located at 12.6° was observed. From the SEM image shown in Figure 1a, it was assumed that there is no PbI2 left at least on sample A surface (Figure 1a). The small PbI2 peak appearing in XRD for sample A might be from the decomposition of perovskite absorption, emission and EQE observed (Figures 2b, c and 4) in this study could be due to the pass iv ation of defects in FAPbI3 by PbI2. Similar pass iv ation of perovskite with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been found while PCBM was coated on perovskite surface. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results showed that the lifetime of FAD3 was also significantly increased from 110 ns for PbI2 deficient (sample A) to 529 ns for PbI2 rich (sample D), indicating that PbI2 actually passivate the perovskite defects significantly. Figure 3 a shows the light current–voltage (J-V) curve of the devices with different residual contents of PbI2. According to the reverse scan (·VOC to JSC), it was found that the devices with PbI2 deficient showed lower performance in all parameters, and the devices only showed 18.3% power conversion efficiency (device A).

For sample A, almost all diffraction peaks were originated from  perovskite phase, only a weak   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   diffraction peak located at   $12.6^{\\circ}$   was observed. From the SEM image shown in Figure 1a,  it was assumed that there is no   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   left at least on sample A  surface (Figure 1a). The small   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peak appearing in XRD  for sample A might be from the decomposition of perovskite  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/81df05dcf7cb793c6ed8ea854b52e8f914d7409a28e7517973843f47c77e1918-1723832621.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   Properties of perovskite layers with different compositions. a) X-ray diffraction pattern of perovskite films with different compositions.  b) UV–vis absorption spectra of perovskite with different compositions. c) Steady-state photo luminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite with different  compositions. d) Time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) spectra of perovskite with different compositions.  \n\nabsorption, emission and EQE observed (Figures   $^{2\\mathrm{b},\\mathrm{c}}$   and 4) in  this study could be due to the pass iv ation of defects in  $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   by   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . Similar pass iv ation of perovskite with phenyl-C61-butyric  acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been found while PCBM was  coated on perovskite surface.  Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results showed that the lifetime of   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$  was also significantly increased from 110 ns for   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   deficient \n\n (sample A) to 529 ns for   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   rich (sample D), indicating that \n\n  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   actually passivate the perovskite defects significantly.  \n\nFigure   3 a shows the light current–voltage   $(J-V)$   curve of the  devices with different residual contents of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . According to  the reverse scan (  $\\cdot V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   to  $J_{S C})$  , it was found that the devices with   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   deficient showed lower performance in all parameters,  and the devices only showed   $18.3\\%$   power conversion efficiency  (device A).
