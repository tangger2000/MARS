Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Conveniently,  the widely known inorganic salts for effective encapsulation  are porous robust inorganic salts and densely inorganic ions  salts. The robustly porous inorganic salts include mesoporous  silica, zeolites and some uniform   $\\mathrm{CaF}_{2}$   hierarchical nanospheres (HNSs) or magnesium silicate hollow spheres (MSHSs)  obtained by natural or artificial way. These porous inorganic salts  could localize PQDs in confined space inhibiting aggregation  \n\neffectively and act as protective layer against the attack of  oxygen or moisture by prohibiting the lattice disturbance or  degradation.  And dense inorganic ionic salts can provide  robust matrix for PQDs resulting in a remarkable improvement  of stability.  \n\nThe mesoporous silica composed by either pure silica or  a lumi no silicate, is one of the wide varieties of both natural and  synthetic inorganic salts exhibiting long-range ordered framework and high level of porosity over widely varying length  scales with diameters about   $2–50~\\mathrm{nm}$  .  Usually, there are  some well-known MS members such as MCM-41, MCM-48,  and SBA-15. The structure of MCM-41 is characterized by a  hexagonal packing of 1D channels with pore diameters ranging  from 20 to   $100\\textup{\\AA}$  .  The MCM-48 with cubic   $I a3d$   structure  has a bi continuous structure as two independent and intricately  interwoven networks of mesoporous channels. The SBA-15 is  a hexagonal silica with a larger pore size than MCM-41 and  thicker silica cell walls. As more and more mesoporous silicates  were reported successively, the complexity of MS materials  has greatly boomed the synthesis of PQDs.  Malgras et  al.  found quantum confinement effects of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   QDs in  the MS matrix. By increasing the pores size, a gradual redshift  of PL was observed along with significant peak broadening  ( Figure    $\\mathrm{7a}$  ) and increasing PL lifetimes (Figure 7c). They also  embedded PQDs of different compositions inside the same MS  and found a clear change of color as displayed in Figure   $7\\mathrm{b}$  ,  which provides a direct evidence for the small variations of  band gap, confirming that most   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
