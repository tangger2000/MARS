Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

Some of the germanium per ovsk ites exhibited intense  type I phase-matchable SHG signals. The second-order nonlinear susceptibility,   $\\chi^{(2)}$  , was determined to be   $(125.3\\pm10.5)$  ), \n\n  $(161.0\\pm14.5)$  ),   $(143.0\\pm13.5)$  , and  $(57.2\\pm5.5)\\,\\mathrm{pm\\,V^{-1}}$  , for  ${\\mathrm{CosGeI}}_{3}$  , \n\n  $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{GeI}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{NH}_{2})_{2}\\mathrm{GeI}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{NH}_{2})_{2}\\mathrm{GeI}_{3}$  , respec- tively, as compared with that of the reference material   $\\mathrm{AgGaS}_{2}$   $(d_{36}=(31\\pm5)\\mathrm{\\pmV^{-1}})$  ).  First-principles DFT calculations suggested that the large second-order nonlinear susceptibility was  attributed to the high density of states in the valence band of  the sp-hybridized Ge and I orbitals. Similarly, halo bismuthate  per ovsk ites with mixed halides,   $\\mathrm{\\small{[NH_{2}(C H_{2}C H_{3})_{2}]_{3}B i(C l_{1-x}B r_{x})_{6}}}$  (  $\\prime x=0$  , 0.135, 0.255, 0.385, 0.847, and 1), exhibited a regulated  effect on their bandgaps and SHG capacities.  \n\n# 2.2.

A comparative study of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbX}_{3}$     $\\mathrm{(X=Cl.}$  , Br, I) perovskite thin films suggested that   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   indeed exhibited a stronger NLO   $(7\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,W}^{-1}$  ,  using 40 fs pulsed laser radiation at   $800\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ) than those of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbCl}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   halide per ovsk ites.  Furthermore, Zhao and co-workers studied the third-order NLO  \n\nresponse of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   films in the mid-infrared regime. The results of the closed-aperture Z-scan measurements suggested a self-focusing effect of the   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   film with an  NRI of   ${\\approx}1.4\\times10^{-12}$   and   ${\\approx}1.6\\,\\times\\,10^{-12}\\,\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\,\\mathbb{W}^{-1}$   when pumped  at 1560 and   $1930\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , respectively. The relationship between  the optical transmittance and the optical intensity suggested a  saturable absorption response of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   films with a low  threshold. A saturable intensity of 0.10 and   $1.19~\\mathrm{MW}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and  a modulation depth of 2.51 and   $8.04\\%$   have been observed at  1560 and   $1930~\\mathrm{nm}$  , respectively. By partially replacing   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   with  Sn ions, Zhang and co-workers fabricated  $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{Pb}_{0.75}\\mathrm{Sn}_{0.25}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  thin films with a significantly lower intrinsic bandgap of   ${\\approx}1.36$    eV, corresponding to an absorption edge at   ${\\approx}910\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}}$  .  These films demonstrate an ultralarge nonlinear absorption  coefficient of   $1.15~\\mathrm{cm}~\\mathrm{kW}^{-1}$   at a wavelength that is compatible  with the optical communication wavelength band (OCWB). Hence, they realized direct infrared photo detection devices with  favorable performances at   $1535\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nIn contrast to films, Sutherland et al. prepared high-quality  single crystals of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   and measured their twophoton absorption (2PA) coefficient to be   $8.6\\,\\pm\\,0.5\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}\\,\\,\\mathrm{GW}^{-1}$  through static intensity-dependent transmission measurements  with ultrashort pulses (100 fs) at   $800\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , comparable to that  of epitaxial single-crystal semiconductors with similar bandgaps.  They also observed a sharp and narrow up conversion  two-photon excited photo luminescence peak at   $572\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   from   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   single crystals. Saliba et al. observed a strongly  non monotonous wavelength shift of this two-photon photoluminescence with increasing temperature, which was assumed  to be associated with discrete transitions between several stable  crystalline phases.  Remarkably, fluence dependence measurements suggested a scaling of the photo luminescence with the  fourth power of the excitation density at room temperature, in  contrast to a quadratic behavior at cryogenic temperatures. This  was attributed to a transition from exciton gas to free charge  carriers with an increasing temperature. A similar temperaturedependent fluorescence has been observed from a formamidinium (FA) lead halide perovskite   $\\mathrm{FAPbBr}_{3}$   nano crystal.  \n\nExcept for the 3D per ovsk ites such as   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$  and   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  , 2D per ovsk ites  including   $\\mathrm{(PEA_{2}P b I_{4})}$  (PEA\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
