Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The UV–vis  absorption spectra are shown in  Figure   3 a, while the relevant  parameters are presented in  Table   1 . Two distinct absorption  peaks, assigned to the   $\\scriptstyle{\\pi-\\pi^{*}}$   transition and ICT absorption, respectively, were observed for both MPA-BTI (335 and   $487\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) and MPA-BTTI (343 and   $532\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ), in good agreement with the DFT calculations. In solid state, the absorption  profile of MPA-BTI becomes broadened and redshifted likely  due to the formation of   $J$  -aggregates as commonly observed  in many   $\\pi$  -conjugated molecules. In contrast, a hy pso chromic  shift   $(\\approx\\!10\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) from 532 to  $522~\\mathrm{nm}$   was found for MPA-BTTI,  likely attributed to   $H$  -aggregation formation in solid state.  This is reasonable given that MPA-BTTI features a more  extended   $\\pi$  system with symmetrical structure and improved  planarity, which is beneficial for face-to-face molecular  packing. This phenomenon is ubiquitous in metal-phthalocyanine-based molecules, which exhibit specific   $H$  -aggregation  in thin film due to their pronounced ly large and planar structures.  Such different packing characteristics between MPABTI and MPA-BTTI can significantly affect the film morphologies. It should be noted that although such D–A molecules  can lead to absorption in the visible region, the impact of this  on solar cell performance can be attenuated by using a thin  layer of the SM-HTMs, which can be constrained to below   ${\\approx}10$   nm. Consequently, the transmittance still remains above   $65\\%$   in the range of   $400{-}650\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . As shown in Figure S3 in  the Supporting Information, this is only   ${\\approx}10\\%$   less than that  of the bare indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate, ensuring  that the majority of the photons can reach the perovskite  active layer.  \n\nElectrochemical properties of these SM-HTMs were measured next by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the cyclic voltammograms are shown in Figure 3b, while the relevant data are  included in Table 1. Evident oxidative and reductive processes  could be observed for both MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI with  similar profiles. With ferrocene/ferro ceni um redox as the reference, the HOMO levels of MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI are  determined to be   $-5.28$   and   $-5.24~\\mathrm{eV},$   and the LUMO levels  are calculated to be   $-3.15$   and   $-3.32~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively.  The  upshifted HOMO level, the down shifted LUMO level, and  the resultant narrower bandgap from MPA-BTI to MPA-BTTI  are in good agreement with the DFT calculation results. To  further confirm the energy levels in solid state, ultraviolet  photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to characterize the  HOMO levels of MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI films.

According  to the equation:  $\\Phi=21.2-\\left(E_{\\mathrm{cut-off}}-E_{\\mathrm{onset}}\\right)$  ,  the HOMO levels  of MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI are calculated to be   $-5.36$   and   $-5.32~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively. By subtracting the optical bandgap   $(E_{\\mathrm{g}}^{\\mathrm{\\,opt}})$    in solid state from HOMO level, the LUMO levels are found  to be   $-3.24$   and   $-3.40\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  , respectively, which are close to the  results determined from CV measurements. More importantly,  the energy levels obtained from solid state suggest that the  HOMO levels of such SM-HTMs match well with the perovskite layer   $({\\approx}5.4\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   to enhance hole extraction, and simultaneously the LUMO levels are shallow enough to block electron  leakage.  \n\nTo further evaluate the properties of MPA-BTI and MPABTTI, the thermal stability of films was probed. As shown  in Table  1 and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, the  thermo grav i metric analysis (TGA) reveals nearly the same  decomposition temperatures  $\\left(T_{\\mathrm{d}}\\mathrm{s}\\right)$   of MPA-BTI   $(432\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   and MPABTTI   $(431~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  . However, the differential scanning calorimetry \n\n (DSC) shows clearly distinct thermal properties of two HTMs \n\n (see Figure 3c). For MPA-BTI, a low glass transition temperatures   $(T_{\\mathrm{g}})$   of   $86~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is detected during the second heating scan,  followed by an exothermic peak at  ${\\approx}200\\ ^{\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
