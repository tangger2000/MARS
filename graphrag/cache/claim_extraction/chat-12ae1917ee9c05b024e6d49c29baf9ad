It can be seen that   $\\mathrm{LaCOO}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{LaNSiO}_{3}$    have a higher catalytic activity with the lowest over potential of  380 at current density of   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (  $.\\eta_{10}=380~\\mathrm{mV})$  ), followed  by  $\\mathrm{LaCrdO}_{3}$   (  $.\\eta_{10}=420\\;\\mathrm{mV})$  ),   $\\mathrm{LaFeO}_{3}$   (  $(\\eta_{10}=437~\\mathrm{mV})$  ), and   $\\mathrm{LaMlnO}_{3}$    with the worst performance of   $\\eta_{10}=460\\ \\mathrm{mV}.$   Tafel slopes show  the similar trend. The resulting polarization linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of HEPOs are shown in  Figure   4 a.  L5M has   $\\eta_{10}=359\\;\\mathrm{mV},$   which outperforms all single perovskite  oxides. With the concentration of an element doubled, the OER  performance improves, as compared to the equimolar HEPO  of L5M.

The L5M2Co shows the best OER  performance with the lowest   $\\eta_{10}$   of   $325\\,\\mathrm{\\mV.}$  . L5M2Ni shows  the second-best performance with   $\\eta_{10}=335\\ \\mathrm{mV},$   followed by  L5M2Cr and L5M2Fe   $(\\eta_{10}=343~\\mathrm{mV})$  ), and then L5M2Mn   $.\\eta_{10}=$     $353~\\mathrm{mV}$  ). This order echoes that of the single-metal perovskite  oxides. TOF demonstrates the same order. L5M2Co has the  highest TOF value of  $0.0267\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . To investigate the kinetics, Tafel  slopes were derived from the LSV curves, as shown in Figure 4c.  The kinetic activity of HEPOs based on the Tafel slope follows  the order: L5M2Co   $(51.2~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1})\\,>\\,\\mathrm{L}5\\mathrm{M}2\\mathrm{Fe}$     $(54~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1})$   \n\n  $>\\mathrm{L}5\\mathrm{M}2\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{i}$     $\\mathrm{\\{55.1\\mV\\dec^{-1}\\}>L5M2C r\\ (56\\mV\\dec^{-1})>L5M2M n}$   \n\n  $(66.3{\\mathrm{~mV}}\\mathrm{{~dec}}^{-1})>\\mathrm{{L}5M}$     $(78.6~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1})$  .

The electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs)  of all samples were estimated from the double layer capacitance   $\\left(C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\right)$  . The recorded cyclic voltammetry (CV)  curves at different  scan rates are shown in Figure S11, Supporting Information.   $(J_{\\mathrm{a}}-J_{\\mathrm{c}})/2$   versus the scan rate for all the samples are shown  in Figure 4d. ECSA values were calculate from the slopes or   $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$    and are shown in Table S4, Supporting Information. L5M2Fe  gives largest ECSA, while L5M2Cr has the lowest   $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$  or ECSA  due to agglomerated morphology. LSV curves were then normalized to the ECSA to evaluate the intrinsic activity, as shown  in Figure  4e. L5M2Co shows the highest intrinsic catalytic  activity or the lowest over potential of   $400\\ \\mathrm{mV}$   at   $10\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$     $(\\eta_{10,\\;\\mathrm{ECSA}})$  . The intrinsic catalytic activities of the samples follow  the order: L  $5\\mathrm{M}2\\mathrm{Co}>\\mathrm{L}5\\mathrm{M}2\\mathrm{Ni}\\sim\\mathrm{L}5\\mathrm{M}2\\mathrm{Cr}>\\mathrm{L}5\\mathrm{M}2\\mathrm{Fe}>\\mathrm{L}5\\mathrm{M}2\\mathrm{Mn}$     $>\\,\\mathrm{L}5\\mathrm{M}$  . L5M2Co remains as the best electro catalyst. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed  to understand the effect of electrical conductivity on the OER  performance. The resulting Nyquist plots measured at an overpotential of   $285~\\mathrm{mV}$   are given in Figure 4f. An equivalent circuit consisting of the electrolyte resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$  , charge transfer  resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$  , and constant phase element (CPE) is shown in  the figure inset. The order of the charge transfer resistance for  HEPOs samples is: L5M2Co (17 .7   $\\Omega$  ), L5M2Ni   $(18.2\\;\\Omega)$  , L5M2Fe \n\n  $(21.2\\ \\ \\Omega)$  , L5M2Cr   $(23.3\\ \\ \\Omega)$  , L5M2Mn   $(33.8\\ \\ \\Omega)$  , and L5M \n\n  $(48.5~\\Omega)$  , coincides with the order of the OER activity. L5M2Co  exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance during the OER,  thereby achieving faster and more efficient charge transfer for  OER electro catalysis.  \n\nTo gain the insight of the intrinsic activity of HEPOs, the  surface chemistry is discussed. The valent states of each metal  obtained from the above XPS spectra are shown in Table S2,  Supporting Information. The surface metals exhibit a variety  of oxidation states. Ni shows only   $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}$  , except that the L5M2Ni  sample has both  $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}}$   and  $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}$  . The  $\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$   ratio is the highest  in each of the HEPO samples. Both   $\\mathrm{Cr}$   and Mn have higher  oxidation states of   $\\mathrm{Cr^{6+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$  , respectively. Such valent  state variations cannot be explained by simply considering  the electronegativity but involves complex electronic structure  modifications (Figure S12, Supporting Information). However,  a catalyst having high oxidation states is often favorable for  the electro catalytic activity. Of note here is that the variations  of the oxidation state ratios in all the HESO samples remarkably follow the same trend, as shown in Figure S13, Supporting  Information, except the L5M2Ni. Therefore, we first consider  the L5M, L5M2Mn, L5M2Fe, L5M2Cr, and L5M2Co samples.  In general, the catalytic activity increases with the amount the  high oxidation states. L5M2Co, exhibiting the best OER activity,  has the largest amounts of   $\\mathrm{Cr^{6+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$  , and   ${C0}^{3+}$  . The presence of Cr has been shown to increase OER activity in various  materials.
