Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The defects with deep transition  levels are assigned to I atoms at MA sites   $\\mathrm{\\left(I_{MA}\\right)}$  , I atoms at   $\\mathrm{Pb}$    sites   $\\left(\\mathrm{I_{Pb}}\\right)$  ,   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   interstitial s   $\\mathrm{{(Pb}_{\\mathrm{i}})}$  , and   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atoms at I sites   $(\\mathrm{Pb_{I}})$    with high formation energies. Yin et al. found that   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   has  predominantly shallow defects. A simulated atomic structure,  a supercell with two   $\\Sigma5(310)$   grain boundaries (GBs) with the  same structure as that in   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  , is shown in Figure  5b.   The  Σ 5(310) GB was chosen because of the typical features  of GBs in semiconductors, for example, “wrong” bonds, dangling bonds, and extra bonds. The ideal bandgap for   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$  is displayed in Figure 5b   $(\\beta)$  . Furthermore, the partial density of  states (DOS) of typical   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   and I atoms at the  Σ 5(310) GB region  indicates that there are no gap states, as shown in Figure  5b \n\n  $(\\gamma_{-}\\zeta)$  .  \n\nBuin et  al.  reported the intrinsic st abilities of pure \n\n  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$   crystals, along with the  defect formation energies. In HMHP materials, the X sites  are substituted by different halides such as iodide, bromide,  and chloride. The halide significantly affects the stability under  ambient conditions. Many reports have addressed the st abilities  of these materials, which were observed to increase in the order  of   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}<\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3}<\\mathrm{MAPbCl}_{3}$  , based on XRD patterns,  as shown in Figure 5c–e, and discussed the effects of different  halides on the chemical properties and the defect physical properties.  In particular, these phenomena have been proposed  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/233caccf16585ff926f38a08cdb1bc21d27a0a1cca061447a9955801dc425e77-1727122309.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a) Representative crystal structures of halide per ovsk ites in different dimensions. b) Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering  (GIWAXS) maps of poly crystalline room-temperature-cast and c) near-single-crystalline hot-cast   $(\\mathsf{B A})_{2}(\\mathsf{M A})_{3}\\mathsf{P b}_{4}|_{13}$   perovskite films (where   ${\\mathsf{B A}}\\,=$  but yl ammonium), with the Miller indices of the most prominent peaks shown in white.

After the formation of HMHP materials, the thermodynamic  defect transition levels are defined by their formation energies.  In Figure   $5\\mathrm{f-k}_{z}$  , the DFT eigenvalues are shown as solid lines  for the near-band-edge states and dashed lines for the in-gap  states. These defect states are generally assigned to shallow and  deep levels, respectively, as shown. The defect states have been  reported for two different conditions, halide-rich and halidepoor, for the three different halide-substituted HMHPs.
