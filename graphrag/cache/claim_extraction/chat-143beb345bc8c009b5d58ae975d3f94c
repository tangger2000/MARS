Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

By contrast, the EL peak of treated LEDs remained stable, demonstrating the e ect ive ness of the bi-ligand strategy in preventing the phase separation (Figure  $^{4\\mathrm{g,h,}}$  ). We also obtained the electroluminescence spectra of   $\\mathrm{L}_{90}$  ,   $\\mathrm{L}_{70}$  , and  $\\mathrm{L}_{50}$   (Figure  S13a,b , Supporting Information). As time progressed, the emission peaks of the control LED exhibited a shift due to halogen ion segregation under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld. However, the emission peaks of the treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   LED remained stable, which are consistent with the results that the introduction of AHI/OI suppresses halogen ion migration. To further demonstrate this inhibition of halogen ion migration, we employed time-of-ﬂight secondary-ion mass spectrometry to measure the element distribution of the fresh and  $\\mathrm{L}_{50}$   aged  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   LEDs with AHI/OI treatment (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). The analysis revealed no halide distribution changes in the fresh and aged LEDs, consistent with the stable EL spectra of   $\\mathrm{L}_{90}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{L}_{70}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{L}_{50}$   in the treated ﬁlms.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, the bi-ligand synergy strategy increases the vacancy formation energy of halogen ions through the synergy of biligand, thus inhibiting the generation and migration of halogen ion vacancies. This allows us to prepare  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms with low defect density, high stability, and high PLQY. Through the use of the treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nano crystals, we achieve  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   LEDs with a record EQE of   $21.2\\%$   approaching Rec.2100 standards for pure red emissions (0.698, 0.301). The biligand synergy strategy is helpful to improve the stability of mixed lead halide nano crystals and has important guiding sign i can ce for improving mixed lead halide per ovsk ites LED devices.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nH.W.D. and F.Z. contributed equally to this work.
