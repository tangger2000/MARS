Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In addition, to suppress the surface recombination, the surface of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods was cover by PEI film.  The PSC based on this modified   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods yields a PCE of   $16.1\\%$  .  Similar results can be obtained by  $\\mathrm{Mg},^{[162,163]}\\mathrm{G}o,$  Sn,    $\\operatorname{In}$  ,  and  $\\mathrm{Ni}^{[169]}$   doping.  \n\nAs for the stability, the reduction of surface defects and  surface pass iv ation are effective for improving the stability of  PSCs either. After surface pass iv ation, the active  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   surface is  covered with   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  , PEI,    $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  , or other stabilized material,  which have been proved not to react with perovskite films. As  a result, the chemical instability induced by   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and chemical  residues can also be avoided. Figure 7e,f exhibited the XRD patterns of perovskite film on PCBM and PEI modified   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films  during annealing process. And the XRD patterns of perovskite  on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film without modification are shown in Figure   $7\\mathrm{g}$  .  As can be seen, for unmodified   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , perovskite decomposes  rapidly after 30 min annealing. The perovskite on PCBM modified ZnO remains stable for the beginning   $30~\\mathrm{min}$   and starts  to decompose as the time goes on. And the perovskite on PEI  modified  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   remains stable for the whole annealing process.  \n\nThe different stability between perovskite on PEI modified   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  and PCBM modified   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   is mainly because the PCBM will  aggregate under high temperature, as a result, the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   will  contact with perovskite again.  \n\nIt is worth noting that the thickness of the pass iv ation layer  should be precisely controlled to avoid any negative effects, e.g.,  increase in series resistance. In addition, especially for solution  processed   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs, high temperature annealing is an efficient method, though not ideal in terms of energy consumption, to improve the stability of PSCs. Yang et al.  and Cheng  et al.  reported improved stability of PSCs using this method.  Figure   $^{7\\mathrm{g,h}}$   shows the XRD patterns of perovskite films during  annealing on different   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films. As shown in the figures, the  perovskite on annealed   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   demonstrates better stability. This  is because by high temperature annealing, the surface hydroxyl  groups and residual organic ligands, which are responsible for  instability, decompose and volatilize. In addition, the perovskite  film can remain stable on AZO films. Figure 7i shows the  photos of perovskite films on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film, AZO film prepared  by RF sputtering, and   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film prepared by sol–gel method.  As can be seen, the perovskite on ZnO films prepared by RF  \n\nTable 1.   The overview of PSCs based on ZnO ETM with different morph o logie s. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/4cc81054e4ed5c00488856d9132cbb4cdd74a93dc69c6d314dd25338a6fa7d85-1727115218.jpg)  \n\nsputtering method exhibited much higher thermal ability than  stability between   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   prepared by RF sputtering and sol–gel  perovskite on  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   fabricated by sol–gel method. And the stamethod is because there are no chemical residues and less  bility was further improved by Al doping. The difference of  defects in   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   prepared by RF sputtering. As for Al doping,  according to Zhao et al.  and Tseng et al.  the improved  stability can be ascribed to the lower surface basicity of AZO  films than that of pure  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films. Lewis acid sites are produced  on the surface of the grains introduced by replacing Zn with Al  in AZO, as shown in Figure 7j. Overall, the two methods mentioned above can suppress the recombination and improve the  stability simultaneously.  \n\nTo sum up, the performance and structure of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM from different fabrication processes are compared  in  Table   1 . As can be seen, the best performing PSC based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM shows a PCE of   $17.6\\%$   and RF sputtering method  was used to fabricate the planar Al doped   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM. Another  PSC with PCE over   $17\\%$   is based on the   $\\mathrm{{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{{O}_{3}}}$   modified   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanorods, which is prepared by the hydrothermal method  and modified by ALD. Therefore, the fabrication method and  surface morphology of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM are not the only determinant  factors for high performance of PSCs. Additionally, by comparing the performance of PSCs based on the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM and  the AZO ETM (both prepared by RF sputtering), we can find  that the Al doping can efficiently improve the performance the  PSCs. Similar trend can also be found between the PSCs based  on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods with and without surface modification. As  a result, optimization of PSCs should not be restricted to only  the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM but should also be applied to the properties of  interface and other layers. Nonetheless, PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  materials have made great progress, and a great deal of efforts  have been made to solve the instability and serious recombination induced by the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM, which are the main reasons for  the inferior performance of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based PSCs compared  with their   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   counterparts. Through the modification of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM, the performance of PSCs based on the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM  is further improved. Although remarkable results have been  achieved, some issues are yet to be addressed, e.g., long-term  stability, and researches on the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM and the optimization  of PSCs based on the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM have to be carried on.  \n\n# 7.
