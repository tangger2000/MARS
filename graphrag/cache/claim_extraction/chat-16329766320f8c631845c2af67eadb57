Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As a result, RF sputtering method is an efficient method to fabricate  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM for PSCs application.  \n\nTseng et al. studied the influence of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film quality and  RF sputtering parameters on solar cell performance.  In their  research, compact  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films were fabricated by RF sputtering  with different   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}/(\\mathrm{Ar\\,+\\,O}_{2})$   ratios (0,   $10\\%$  ,   $20\\%$  , marked as  Zn-Ar,   $_{\\mathrm{Zn-10\\%}}$  , and   $_{\\mathrm{Zn-}20\\%}$  , respectively), and planar heterojunction PSCs with structure of indium tin oxide   $\\mathrm{(ITO)/Z n O/}$   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}l_{3}/\\Delta~}}$  spiro-OMeTAD were fabricated.  \n\nThe surface morph o logie s and cross-section images of  devices are shown in  Figure    $\\mathbf{3a-g}$  . Different working gases have  no obvious influence on the crystal lin it y and morphology of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films deposited on ITO surfaces and likewise for perovskite films deposited on the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   surfaces. However, the performances of solar cells based on different   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films are quite  different. The PCEs of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films deposited  with different working gases are shown in Figure 3h. As can  be seen, solar cells consist of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films prepared under pure  argon show the best PCE of   $15.9\\%$  , and the other solar cells  based on  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films fabricated under   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}/\\mathrm{Ar}$   mixed gases show  similar PCEs of about   $12\\%$  . Considering that other components  in both types of cells are the same, the increase in the PCE of  the former can be attributed to the different fabrication processes of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films. As well known, under ideal conditions,  the stoic hio metric   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   is an insulator. However, due to the  intrinsic defects existing in the lattice, ZnO materials generally show electrical conductivity. When there is stoichiometry deviation, in most cases, anion vacancies, interstitial s, or  oxygen defects are produced, which distorts the corresponding  energy level and forms additional electron and donor levels.  The donor levels are usually close to the conduction band  edge. As a result, most   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   materials show the n-type character.  Therefore, pure Ar gas used during RF sputtering can  lead higher oxygen deficiency concentration, which increases  the conductivity of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and lowers the series resistance. This  is confirmed by the dark current of solar cell which shown in  Figure 3i. As can be seen, solar cell based on   $_{\\mathrm{ZnO-Ar}}$   shows  the smallest dark current compared with solar cells based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}.10\\%$   and   $_{\\mathrm{ZnO-}20\\%}$  . In addition, when pure Ar gas is  used during RF sputtering, the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   valence band will down  shift, like shown in Figure 3j. Lower conduction and valance  band edge can enhance electron injection from perovskite to  \n\n$\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and block the hole more efficiently, which can be proved  by the weaker photo luminescence (PL) intensity of perovskite  film deposited on   $\\mathrm{ZnO-Ar}$   (shown in Figure 3k). Lower series  resistance and high electron extraction efficiency lead a higher   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  . On the other hand, the high charge extraction leads  to smaller current hysteresis of solar cells based on the   $_{\\mathrm{ZnO-Ar}}$  ETM than that of solar cells based on the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM deposited  with   $\\mathrm{Ar/O}_{2}$   mixed working gases.  \n\nBesides RF sputtering method, atomic layer deposition  (ALD) technology is another common method to fabricate   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  compact films. ALD is a technology derived from chemical  vapor deposition, which has been widely used in semiconductor industry to produce high quality semiconductor films.  As shown in Figure 2e, one whole ALD deposition cycle is  divided into four steps: (1) precursor A is pulse injected into  a reaction chamber and forms a single molecule film on substrate by chemical absorption; (2) the unreacted precursor is  swept by an inert gas flow; (3) another precursor B is injected  into the reaction chamber and then reacts with the precursor A  absorbed on the substrate, and a thin product film is formed;  (4) the excess precursor and the by-products of the reaction are  swept by the inert gas flow. Due to the limitation of chemical  absorption, only a single molecule film will be formed every  circle.  As a result, the whole process is accurately controlled  and the coverage of product film is very high.  Moreover,  different from the RF sputtering method, the ALD coating process is more facile, which prevents the substrate from being  damaged by high energy ions.  \n\nDue to the facile process, high surface coverage, and good  electron transport ability of product film, ALD has been widely  used to fabricate ultrathin and compact high quality   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  ETM.  For ALD-ZnO films, the film thickness is an  important factor affecting solar cell performance. Lee et al. system a tic ally studied the effect of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film thickness on PSCs  performance.  In their research, they fabricated   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films  with thicknesses ranging from 5 to   $40~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   by ALD method and  prepared PSCs with the structure of   $\\mathrm{ITO/Z n O/MAPbI}_{3}/5$  SpiroOMeTAD/  $\\mathrm{{>}M o O_{3}/A g}$  . As well known, the ITO usually used has  rough surface, as shown\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
