Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Inset shows the   $\\mathsf{E Q E}_{\\mathsf{E L}}$   of  $\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\approx\\mathrm{\\Omega}.5\\%$   at a driving current equal to the short-circuit current of the device. Evolution of the  $\\mathsf{E Q E}_{\\mathsf{E L}}$   for  the un encapsulated quasi-2D perovskite LED measured under an air atmosphere of   ${\\approx}37\\%$   RH at a constant current density of c)   $200\\textsf{m A c m}^{-2}$   and  d)  $1000\\textsf{m A c m}^{-2}$  .  \n\n$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{oc,nonrad}}$  , a predicted   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.24~\\mathrm{V}$   is obtained, confirming the  value of   $1.23~\\mathrm{V}$   measured from the  $J{-}V$  curve.  \n\nFurthermore, the   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   of the solar cell device reaches up  to   $3.85\\%$   at a high current density of   $342~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (Figure 4b)  and a high brightness of 68.4  W   $\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{m}}^{-2}$   (Figure  4a). The  quasi-2D perovskite LED shows a low efficiency roll-off at high  driving current density. The   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   value has almost no roll-off  at  $500\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and remains   $50\\%$   of its peak even at an enormous injection current density of   $1880~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . We evaluate  the operation stability of the un encapsulated LED devices under  an air atmosphere with relative humidity of   ${\\approx}37\\%$  . As shown in  Figure 4c,d, an enhancement of the   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   can be observed in  the first few hours of device operation. We believe this is probably resulting from two reasons: 1) a slow trap-filling process  by the injected carriers and/or ionic motion; 2) a slow internal  field-redistribution due to local ionic motion of excess ions  under external electric field.  The device   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   decays to  half of the initial value after   ${\\approx}96\\$   h of continuous operation at  a given current density of   $200\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , creating a new record  of operation lifetime for perovskite LEDs, and even better than  the best performing near infrared organic LEDs.  For a  higher injection current density of   $1000\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , the operation  lifetime of quasi-2D perovskite LED still reaches an impressed   $5.35\\mathrm{~h~}$  . Our results suggest that the good stability of the LED  devices can be attributed to the intrinsic stability of quasi-2D  perovskite films with high crystal lin it y and a low level of defects.  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that high performance  solar cells and LEDs can be achieved by using 3BBAI based  quasi-2D perovskite film. The film has a layered structure of  vertically oriented small $\\cdot n$   per ovsk ites covered by a layer of  oriented large $_{,n}$   components. This unique micro structure leads  to form an energetically ordered and highly crystalline perovs­ kite film with good charge transport, suppressed non radiative  recombination, and excellent moisture resistance. Our results  suggest that 3BBAI based quasi-2D perovskite materials are  ideal for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cell, LEDs  and other op to electronic applications, and tuning the growth of  2D perovskite films is a key step toward achieving this goal.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis and Materials Preparation : 3BBAI was synthesized by adding  hydroiodic acid (1 mmol) into a solution of   $m$  -Br-benz yl amine (1 mmol)  in ethanol   $(20~\\mathsf{m L})$   at   $0~^{\\circ}\\mathsf C$  and then stirred for   $2~\\mathsf{h}$  . Next, the solution  was evaporated at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   to obtain precipitates, which were washed  three times with diethyl ether and then vacuum-dried at   $35~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $\\mathsf{T}2\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathsf{h}$  .  Precursor solution were prepared by dissolving 3BBAI, MACl, and   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  in DMF with different molar ratio in DMF at a weight concentration of   $20\\%$   and stirring at  $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $8\\;\\mathsf{h}$   in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned  sequentially in acetone and alcohol, followed by   $10~\\mathsf{m i n}$   oxygen plasma  treatment.

After the  substrates were heated to a temperature of   $\\ ]40\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  , the perovskite films  were deposited by hot-casting the precursor solution onto the substrates  at 5000  rpm for   $20~s$   and annealed at   $90~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . An electrontransport layer of  $\\mathsf{P C}_{61}\\,\\mathsf{B M}$   was deposited from a chl oro benzene solution   $(20\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}})$   at 1000 rpm for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$  . Finally, the Cr and Au layers were  deposited using a thermal evaporation system through a shadow mask  under a base pressure o  $\\mathsf{f}\\approx\\mathsf{6}\\times\\mathsf{10^{-7}}$   Torr.
