materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Unfortunately, due to the lack of resonance condition  (limited overlap between STE emission and   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   absorption  profiles), the energy transfer efficiency is only   $7\\%.^{[10a]}$   Similarly,   $\\mathrm{Wi}$   and Lin et al. reported   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}(\\mathrm{Na}/\\mathrm{Ag})\\mathrm{InCl}_{6}$  DPs.  The NIR emission of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions is enhanced by energy  transfer from STEs, but the energy transfer efficiency reported  by  $\\mathrm{Wi}$   et al. is only   $18.6\\%$  .  Therefore, the main obstacle to  obtaining highly efficient NIR emission of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   in DPs is the  low sensitization efficiency caused by undesirable resonance  energy transfer between the sensitizer and   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions, and  should be urgently solved. According to Förster-Dexter energy  transfer theories, the degree of overlap between sensitizer  emission spectrum and activator  $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   absorption profile is one  of the key factors to getting a high energy transfer efficiency.  Therefore, regulating the emission spectrum of the sensitization center with a better resonance with   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   is greatly worth  exploring.  \n\nHerein, we achieved a high-efficiency NIR emission by \n\n  $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doping in the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   DP. Through co-doping \n\n  ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   ions, the STE emission intensity of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   is greatly  enhanced by 240 times and the STE emission shows a redshift of   $60\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , which contributes to a larger spectral overlap  between STE emission and the absorption peaks of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions.  This finally leads to a higher energy transfer efficiency of   $31.0\\%$    and a higher PLQY of   $50\\%$  , compared to the energy transfer  efficiency of   $18.6\\%$   and PLQY of  $46\\%$   for  $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   and  $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   co-doping  samples previously reported, respectively. Finally, benefitting  from the admirable ambient, thermal and light stability and  high-efficiently luminescence of these materials, visible/NIR  light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and optical information encryption with excellent performance based on  $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$   singly doped and   $\\mathrm{{Sub}^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   DPs are realized. Our work provides in-depth insights into highly efficient NIR emissions in  the lead-free DPs and paves the way for the next step in NIR  commercialization of DPs materials.  \n\n# 2.

The X-ray diffraction  (XRD) patterns of undoped and   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$  -doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   match  well with the standard file (ICSD number 244519) of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g^{-}}$   $\\mathrm{InCl}_{6}$   ( Figure    1 a). The diffraction peaks (e.g., at   $24^{\\circ}.$  ) gradually shift toward a lower angle as the concentration of   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$    increases   $(0\\%–5\\%)$  , indicating the progressive lattice expansion  of   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$  -doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   DP due to the substitution of   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$    with   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$  . The increase in lattice parameters is consistent with  the observation that chloride double per ovsk ites with   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   have  larger lattice parameters than their   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$   analogs.  No diffraction peaks of impurity are observed even at high doping concentration, due to the formation of a continuous solid solution   $(\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgIn}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Sh}_{x}\\mathrm{Cl}_{6})$   (Figure S1, Supporting Information).  \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) and corresponding  element mapping of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6}{:1\\%}$  Sb confirm all the elements are homogeneously distributed among the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$    DP (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of undoped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   and   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g I n C l}_{6}{:}1\\%\\ \\mathrm{sl}$  b are shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). High-resolution XPS spectrum of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6}{:1\\%}$  Sb  in the binding energy range of 520–545 eV (Figure S3b, Supporting Information) shows that in addition to O 1s peak, two  additional peaks appear at 531.5 and   $539.0\\,\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   belonging to   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   of   ${\\sf S b}^{3+}$   ion respectively.  Ulteriorly, the precise doping concentration of   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6}{:1\\%}$   Sb was  determined to be   $0.93\\%$   by inductively coupled plasma mass  spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Table S1, Supporting Information),  manifesting most of Sb precursors are doped into   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$    DP.  \n\nAs shown in the absorption spectra (Figure  1b), undoped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   DP has an intense absorption below   $350~\\mathrm{nm}$   and  an additional absorption tail   $(>350\\;\\mathrm{nm})$  . After   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   doping, the  absorbance   $(>\\,350\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  ) dramatically enhances and increases  systematically with increasing   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   content, confirming that   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$  ions facilitate light absorption in this region. At a relatively higher   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$  doping concentration, the absorption edge  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{Ag}\\mathrm{In}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Sh}_{x}\\mathrm{Cl}_{6}$   shows an obvious redshift (Figure S4a,  Supporting Information) with increasing   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   concentration, which leads to the color change from white to greenyellow (Figure   $\\mathsf{S4b}$  , Supporting Information). On account of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   being unable to absorb enough light at longer wavelengths   $(>350\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  , weak emission is observed when undoped  sample is excited at   $370~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  . In contrast, doping   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   leads to   ${\\approx}240$   times enhanced emission with\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
