Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Respective diffraction  planes of   $\\mathrm{\\mathrm{PDAMA}}_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}\\mathrm{I}_{3n+1}$   are shown in Figure 1b, which  contain 3D perovskite-like layers alternating with single PDA  organic cation layers. The small size of PDA results in a short  distance of   $\\approx\\!2\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   between the apical iodine atoms and neighboring layers.  \n\nFor BA-based 2D perovskite in Figure 1, peaks of (0k0) reflections at low diffraction angle can hardly be measured which  is due to the preferred orientation with a high proportion of  grains with their conductive layer parallel to the current conduction direction (i.e., strong (111) and (222) peaks).  More  importantly, the inorganic layers are separated by two large  organic cation layers (e.g., BA) in typical layered per ovsk ites,  leading to a long interlayer distance (7  Å).  The interlayer  distance in   $\\mathrm{\\mathrm{PDAMA}}_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}\\mathrm{I}_{3n+1}$   per ovsk ites, which is significantly shorter than van der Waals distance   $(4\\mathrm{~\\AA})$  , can endow  the perovskite a strong interaction between neighboring layers,  leading to improved st abilities.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/93eb2e307bf4ce9cc92fb62a4daefaca60f00b7094f8b5ab3b46c771d49fde0e-1727117887.jpg)  \nFigure 2.  $\\mathsf{P D A M A}_{n-1}\\mathsf{P b}_{n}\\mathsf{I}_{3n+1}$   perov­ skite thin films with   $n=2$   to 4. b) PL decay profiles of PDA- and BA-based 2D perovskite films with  $\\eta=4$   on ITO/PEDOT: PSS substrate and bare glass  substrate (inset).

It was reported that bandgaps  in the BA-based 2D per ovsk ites   $(\\mathrm{BA}_{2}\\mathrm{MA}_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}\\mathrm{I}_{3n+1})$   increase  from   $1.63\\ \\mathrm{eV}$     $(n=4)$  ) to   $1.96~\\mathrm{eV}$     $(n=2$  ) with decreased thickness of the inorganic layers because of quantum confinement  effects.  Surprisingly, no peak shift is observed in the absorption and photo luminescence (PL) spectra of PDA-based pero- vskite thin films with   $n=2$   to 4. These features indicate that  quantum confinement is not dominating in the PDA-based 2D  per ovsk ites. In other words, charges can effectively transport  across neighboring inorganic layers. To consolidate our discussion, time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy  was used to study charge separation kinetics of the PDA-based  2D perovskite with   $n=4$   on ITO/PEDOT: PSS substrate, as  shown in Figure 2b. Commonly used BA-based 2D perovskite  with   $n=4$   (i.e.,   $\\mathrm{BA}_{2}\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Pb}_{4}\\mathrm{I}_{13})$   on the same substrate was also  measured for comparison. Photo carrier lifetimes of PDA- and  BA-based 2D perovskite are respectively estimated to be   ${\\approx}9$  and 47 ns, suggesting efficient PL quenching of PDA-based 2D  perovskite on the ITO/PEDOT: PSS substrate. The above TRPL  experiment was repeated using bare glass substrate (Figure 2b  inset), photo carrier lifetimes of PDA- and BA-based 2D perovskites are respectively estimated to be   $\\approx\\!500$   and   $370~\\mathrm{ns}$  . This  long photo carrier lifetime of PDA-based 2D perovskite indicates an inhibited charge recombination.  \n\nWe gained further insight into charge transport properties  by analyzing electron and hole mobilities of these 2D perovskites with the commonly used space-charge-limited current  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/dd2c4f1fef872a26a62db672f8f68c943f1d9e97749b65eb4a0358b82eced1aa-1727117850.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $J^{-V}$   curve for the PDA-based 2D PSC with different scan directions. b) EIS spectra of PDA- and BA-based 2D PSCs measured at open circuit  condition (  $V=0.98$   V). c) Stability measurements for the PDA- and the BA-based 2D PSCs at room temperature and   $85\\%$   RH with encapsulation and  d) thermal stability measurements for the PDA- and the BA-based 2D PSCs at high temperature   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   and  $85\\%$   RH without encapsulation.  \n\n(SCLC) method. Figure 2c,d shows current density–voltage \n\n  $(J-V)$   curves of electron-only and hole-only devices, and carrier  mobilities are estimated via a linear fit from SCLC region. Obviously, the PDA-based 2D perovskite devices show a much higher  current density than BA-based 2D perovskite devices at the SCLC  region. By fitting  $J{-}V$   curves at the SCLC region, estimated electron and hole mobilities of PDA-based 2D perovskite devices  are both  ${\\approx}3.8\\times10^{-4}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , which are considerably higher  than that of BA-based 2D devices (i.e.,  $1.2\\times10^{-4}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  . The increased mobilities suggest efficient charge transport  between neighboring inorganic layers in PDA-based 2D perovskite, which is consistent with the TRPL, the absorption, and  the PL results. These encouraging results in PDA-based perovskite appear to be associated with the reduced interlayer distance, which enhances the orbital interactions across the inorganic layers and imparts a certain 3D character to the current  structure, leading to efficient charge transport between neighboring inorganic layers.  These improved op to electronic properties indicate that the PDA-based 2D per ovsk ites are promising materials as absorbers for applications in solar cells.  \n\nSolar cells were fabricated with a configuration of   $\\mathrm{ITO}/$  PEDOT:  PSS/per ovsk ites  $/C_{60}/\\mathrm{BCP}/\\mathrm{Ag}$    and  measured  under standard AM1.5G illumination.  The   $J{-}V$  curves of   $\\mathrm{PDAA}_{3}\\mathrm{Pb}_{4}\\mathrm{I}_{13}$   PSC with different scan directions are shown  in  Figure   3 a. The scan from forward bias to short circuit (forward scan) gives a high power conversion efficiency (PCE)  of   $13.0\\%$   and the reverse scan shows   $12.9\\%$  . This excellent  performance in the PDA-based 2D PSCs is attributed to the  op to electrical properties mentioned above.
