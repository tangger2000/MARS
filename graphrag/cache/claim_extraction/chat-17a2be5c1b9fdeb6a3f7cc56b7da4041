Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

After the introduction of  Cl and Yb elements in the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   host, the UVâ€“vis absorption  peak shifts toward blue due to the gradually increased bandgap  from the original   $2.49\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   to   $2.88\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   (Figure S2, Supporting  Information), resulting from the partial substitution of   $\\mathrm{Br}$   by  Cl element. This also leads to the gradual blue shift from 520 to   $450\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and intensity decrease of the perovskite excitonic emission peak under the excitation of   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  . In the near-infrared  region, a sharp line centered at   $988\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   can be observed for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{x}\\mathrm{Br}_{3\\cdot x}$  :   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   QDs, originating from the   ${^2\\mathrm{F}}_{5/2}{-}{^2\\mathrm{F}}_{7/2}$   transition of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions. Its intensity increases obviously with the  increasing doping concentration of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions. The strong  intrinsic emissions of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions excited by the absorption of  perovskite host readily indicates the successful substitution  of   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   by   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  ions, and also suggest an efficient energy  transfer occurs from the host to   ${\\tt Y b}^{3+}$   ions. Figure 2b shows  the UVâ€“vis absorption and photo luminescence (PL) spectra  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$  ,   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Yb}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Yb}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$    and   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Yb}^{3+}$  + ,  $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   QDs. The introduction of RE ions  without changing anions only slightly results in the increase of  the bandgap of   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$   from 2.84 to  $2.88~\\mathrm{eV}$   and the blue  shift of the excitonic emission band from 455 to   $450~\\mathrm{nm}$  . This  is associated with the decrease of lattice cell with the doping  of RE ions, as depicted in Figure 1k. Although the doping of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   induces the suppress of excitonic emission intensity, the  overall intensity of the excitonic emission and the   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   emission increases about two times than the undoped QDs. Further codoping with   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   leads the overall intensity to decrease  slightly. With increasing the concentration of   $\\mathrm{Er^{3+}}$  , the emission  of   ${}^{4}\\mathrm{I}_{13/2}\\mathrm{-}^{4}\\mathrm{I}_{15/2}$   at   $1540~\\mathrm{nm}$   for   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   become more distinct. The  emission of   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   ions at   $1540\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   may be mainly induced by  the energy transfer from   $\\mathrm{{}^{2}F_{7/2}}$   level of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions to   $^{4}\\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$   level  of   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   ions, because no emission of   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   ions was observed at  the infrared region in the   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$  :   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   perovskite QDs  (Figure S3, Supporting Information). It should be noted that in  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}{\\mathrm{:Yb}}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  QDs, efficient up conversion luminescence originating   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   can be also realized under   $980\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    pumping (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The introduction of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   in   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$   results in the blue   $4\\mathrm{f}{-}5\\mathrm{d}$   emis- sions of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   besides the excitonic band and the overall intensity  \n\nTable 1. â€‚ PLQY of visible part, near-infrared part, and overall region for  different perovskite QDs. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/e248234b3847b9035ec8c66465354af56fdb35ec490b79e238c7d5648cf6364e-1727115380.jpg)  \n\nincreases about two times than the undoped QDs. In the   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Yb}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   QDs, the intensity for   $4\\mathrm{f}{-}5\\mathrm{d}$   emissions of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   suppresses in contrast to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Ca}^{3+}$  ,  while the emission of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  increases largely. The intensity  increase of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   at   $988\\,\\mathrm{~nm}$   is about twice of the intensity  decrease of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   around   $488\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , indicating quantum cutting  emission process happens effectively. In order to further determine the happening of quantum cutting process, the inner  luminescent quantum yields of different QDs are measured by  integral spheres, as listed in  Table   1 . As shown, the PLQY for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   is   $69.2\\%$  , the involving of Cl in the lattices results in  the decrease of PLQY to different contents. It is interesting to  observe that with the introduction of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  , the overall PLQYs  increases largely over the undoped QDs. The PLQYs for  some of the   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$  -doped perovskite QDs even surpass   $100\\%$  .  This indicates that even for the   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   single-doped perovskite  QDs, quantum cutting emission process may also occur. The  codoping of  $\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{e}^{3+}$   accelerates the happening of quantum cutting  emission process, as one of the most famous RE pairs.
