Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Additionally, the presence of oxygen  vacancies intensified the electron enrichment phenomenon. In  Figure 5f, it can be observed that the polarization area around  the oxygen atom significantly increased.  \n\nIn contrast to the spinel/perovskite HE oxides, Figure S33a  (Supporting Information), Figure  5g, and Figure S33b (Supporting Information) depict the band structure of rock salt/ spinel HE oxides with increasing spinel content. The DOS  increased with the spinel phase. Moreover, the band structure  and DOS support the prior conclusion that the system exhibits  metal li city. The gain and loss of electrons between atoms at the  system interface are depicted in Figure 5i. It can be observed  that the electrons tend to move toward the spinel phase. When  the spinel content increases, the ability of oxygen atoms to  acquire electrons at the interface also increases. Figure S33d  \n\n (Supporting Information), Figure  5j and Figure S33e  \n\n (Supporting Information) depict the band structure at various  oxygen vacancy contents. The number of energy bands is considerably higher in Figure S33b (Supporting Information),  while the band gap is shorter. The increased polarization of  oxygen atoms in Figure  5l compared to Figure  5i–1 can be  attributed to electron enrichment due to oxygen vacancies.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn this study, to improve the intrinsically weak microwave  absorption of HE oxides, dual-phase HE ceramic absorbers  were designed; subsequently, their phase content and structural  defects were quantitatively characterized and controlled. Point  defects and stacking faults were observed near the spinel (111)/ perovskite (111) and rock salt (220)/spinel (220) interfaces, and  numerous defects were found inside the complex-phase due  to stress concentration and lattice distortion. Further quantitative characterization of the defects demonstrated their effect on  the EM parameters of HE oxide, i.e., the presence of defects  favors dielectric enhancement. First-principles calculations  confirmed that the modulation of phases and defects can effectively improve the polarization properties of dual-phase HE  oxides. Owning to the numerous heterogeneous interfaces,  multiple defect sites for lossy EM waves, and efficient control  of the electromagnetic parameters by the tunable defects, the  two biphasic HE oxides used in this study demonstrated outstanding broadband microwave absorption in the X-band.  Thus, the EM wave absorption performance of HE oxides was  successfully improved. These results can be used as guidelines  for designing efficient microwave absorbers of HE oxides and  the regulating their components and defects.  \n\n# 4.
