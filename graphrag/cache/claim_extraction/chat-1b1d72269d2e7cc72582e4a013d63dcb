Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

One can see that the PL spectrum exhibits dual emission  peaks that can be well fitted with a blue emission at   $446\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    and a yellow emission at   $550~\\mathrm{nm}$  , matching well with the PL  spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   materials (Figure 1d), respec- tively. Also, the dual-peak emission feature can be well understood by the excitation spectra comparison of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@$   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites with pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$  . As  shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information, the excitation  spectrum of   $\\mathrm{CsCu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites exhibits a bimodal  characteristic, and the former (latter) peak at  $295~\\mathrm{nm}$     $(325~\\mathrm{nm})$  )  corresponds to the excitation spectrum of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$     $\\left(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}\\right)$    host. Therefore, the overlapped excitation band   $(290{-}320\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  )  could activate the blue and yellow emission components simultaneously, generating the white light. Unlike the conventional  multi-component system, the photon self-absorption phenomenon in   $\\mathrm{CsCu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites is negligible due to the  large Stokes shifts of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$     $.228\\;\\mathrm{nm})$  ) and  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$     $(139\\;\\mathrm{nm})$  ).

Note that the observed nanorods  and nanoblocks in the composites were contributed individually from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$  , which are characterized  by distinct morphology features, as shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information. The contents of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cu}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$    in the composites films are estimated to be   ${\\approx}80\\%$   and   ${\\approx}20\\%$    according to the quantitative energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy element analysis and Rietveld refinement of the XRD  data, as seen in Figures S5 and S6; and Table S2, Supporting  Information. Such morphology features can effectively avoid  the color changes of the composites caused by anion exchange  and carriers transfer because two components are individually  existed without the formation of compact structure configuration. To confirm this point, microscopy fluorescence measure- ments at two spots as marked in Figure 2d were conducted. As  shown in Figure 2e, obvious blue (spot A) and yellow emission  (spot B) were observed, corresponding to the intrinsic emission from   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  , respectively. Figure 2f shows  the time-resolved PL decay spectra measured at two spots. For  the Spot A, the lifetime probed at   $446\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   was measured to  be 617 .2 ns (blue line), well consistent with the pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$    material (620.8  ns, green line). For the Spot B, the lifetime  probed at   $550\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   was measured to be 59.8 ns (yellow line), well  consistent with the pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   material (58.7 ns, green line).
