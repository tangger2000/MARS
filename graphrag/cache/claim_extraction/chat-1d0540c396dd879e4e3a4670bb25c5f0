The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.

Specially, the moisture can induce re solvation, re crystal lization, or decomposition of perovskite crystal, resulting in the  degradation of luminescence and a severe efficiency decline  in devices.

The reason is the light-soaking effect associated with  ion migration first; however, exposure under long-light illumination generate halogen vacancy-halogen interstitial pairs that  enable halogens migrate to the surface of PQDs, and then they  are captured by ionic surface resulting in ligands desorption and  regrowth of crystal. The incipient cubic shape PQDs aggregate  into larger nano crystals, which can be observed clearly from the  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement. Generally, the degree of photoinduced deterioration closely depends  on the power illumination amount. For example, the PL intensity of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs in hexane solution decreased to   $40\\%$   after  a long-time illumination under UV light and the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs  films showed a drop of PL intensity about   $88\\%$   compared with  initial intensity after   $24{\\mathrm{~h~}}$  . More seriously, the PL intensity was   $90\\%$   loss in toluene solution under a stronger illumination  from laser.  \n\nEffective encapsulations can maintain the bonding ligands  on surface of PQDs and avert the formation of emissive or none  missive traps, preventing photoinduced regrowth of perovskite  crystal and luminescence deterioration.  The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  mesoporous silica (MS) composites and the amino-mediated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs adsorbed onto the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   microspheres surface  show no obvious PL decrease and peak shift under continuous  UV-light irradiation for more than   $96\\ \\mathrm{~h~}$  .  The thin films  spin coated by   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   Janus QDs displayed a higher  photo stability as only a slight drop   $(\\approx\\!2\\%)$   under a continuous  illumination.  Besides, under consequent excitation using   $800\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   femtosecond laser pulses with a pump intensity of   $600\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{J\\;cm}^{-2}$   over   $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$   in air, the light emission from   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   composites maintains about   $95\\%$   of original intensity and  keeps a stable amplified spontaneous emission after exposure to  atmosphere for 2 month periods.  Furthermore, the photostability of PQDs is greatly enhanced by macroscale hydrophobic  polymeric matrices, which can even sustain   ${>}10^{20}$   absorption  events per quantum   $\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{o}^{[71]}$   (Figure 1b). In addition, under rich  oxygen environment, the photo can convert oxygen into highly  reactive superoxide anion   $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$   via a photo-assisted ionization  or oxidation process. The anion   $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$   can occupy halide vacancy  sites easily resulting PQDs high density of surface defects  without emission or make the PQDs transform into their counterparts as perovskite oxides or other components.  The  presence of decomposition products is certified from X-ray  diffraction and gas chromatography, further confirming the  reliability of a photo-oxidation mechanism. However, encapsulation can indirectly decrease the absorbed photons of PQDs by  the scattering or refraction effect under illumination and avoid  a photo-assisted ionization or oxidation process.  \n\n# 2.3. Enhance the Thermal Stability  \n\nThe thermal stability is a crucial issue always addressed for  practical application of luminescent materials in op to electronic  devices.  Specially, the metal halide perovskite structurally  belonging to the class of soft matter system should show a  large response function to small external perturbations such  as, e.g., temperature increase.  However, thermal can induce  the decrease ment of PL intensity and PLQYs or sever emission  redshift of PQDs, Seriously, the PQDs almost quench under   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for about   $30\\;\\operatorname*{min}.^{[62]}$   The thermo grav i metric analysis  (TGA) indicates that the crystal structure of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   is stable  up to   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , but quickly decomposes above the temperature  due to fragmentation of   ${\\mathrm{CH}}_{3}{\\mathrm{NH}}_{3}{}^{+}$   component. Thermal instability of PQDs is a major bottleneck for further application,  especially in countries with high average temperatures.  \n\nThe cause for poor thermal stability of PQDs can be understood from two sides as easy decomposition of perovskite  crystal and high activities of surface caused by quantum size  effect. On the one hand, because of substantially ionic bonding  character of perovskite crystal, their calculated average thermal  energy at   $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is rather close to their formation energy per  unit cell, instability upon annealing to such temperatures is  expected, resulting in the decomposition with time.  Contrary to common belief as halide perovskite   $(\\mathrm{ABX}_{3})$   usually  disintegrated into their composition such as AX and   $\\mathrm{BX}_{2}$  , in  fact, not all   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   is spent in form of   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{2}$   upon degradation,  as evidenced by an increased contribution of   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atom to energy  position from XPS measurement. Specially, halide perovskite  compounds with A site occupied by the organic–inorganic ions  such as MA or FA, they may actually decompose by reacting  with oxygen and water, as follows the conversion to carbon  species. On the other hand, PQDs are characterized by small  size with high surface energy coordinated by organic ligands.  The absorbed heat can result in desorption and irreversible  decomposition of organic ligands above   $450\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{K}},$  , making PQDs  a strong tendency to aggregate under harsh conditions,\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
