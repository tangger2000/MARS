First, the bending test was  performed with different curvature radii, from 8 to   $2.2~\\mathrm{mm}$    under 200 bending cycles ( Figure   4 a). For comparison, reference ITO-based flexible PSCs with the standard structure  of   $\\mathrm{PEN/ITO/TiO_{2}/P C B M/C H_{3}N H_{3}P b I_{3}/}$  /spiro-OMeTAD/Au  (ITO/Au) were also fabricated. The PCE of carbon-based  flexible PSCs had almost no decrease even after bending  with   $4~\\mathrm{mm}$   curvature and then slightly decreased to   $85\\%$   of  the original efficiency at a curvature radius of   $2.2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$  . In  contrast, the PCE of ITO-based solar cell suffered an obvious  reduction to   $87\\%$   when curvature was lowered to   $4~\\mathrm{mm}$   and  a further bending to   $2.2\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}$   almost led to the complete  damage of the device. Next, the bending curvature was fixed  to   $4~\\mathrm{mm}$  , and multiple bending cycles were conducted. Allcarbon-electrode-based PSC was found to keep about   $84\\%$    of its original value after 2000 bending cycles, which mainly  originated from the reduced  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   (  $11\\%$   loss) and FF (  $.6\\%$  loss),  as shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). However,  the FF and   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the ITO-based flexible PSC were decreased  by  $67\\%$   and  $41\\%$  , respectively, leading to the device efficiency  decreased to   $13\\%$   of its initial value after 1500 bending cycles.  To find out the origin of performance degradation, the electrical resistance changes   $(\\triangle R/R_{0}(\\%))$   of 2-layered graphene/ PET, CSCNTs, and ITO/PEN electrodes were examined as  a function of the bending cycle at the curvature radius of   $4\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}$  , as shown in Figure S10 (Supporting Information).  The resistance of ITO/PEN is dramatically increased after  continuous bending, indicating that the performance degradation of the ITO/PEN-based flexible PSCs largely originated  from the conductivity loss in the brittle ITO layer.  However, the efficiency of the all-carbon-electrode-based flexible  PSCs is still degraded by   $16\\%$   after 2000 bending cycles  although the resistance of CSCNT and graphene electrodes  is unchanged, most likely due to the fracture generated in  crystalline perovskite layer and de lamination in the devices  under deformation.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/48a80fdd91a7170288027ba01d802412df50eedaf7d95ed39bc641185a9c743d-1727077717.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a) PCE evolution of the flexible devices upon increasing bending curvature radius after 200 bending cycles. b) Bending durability of the   $\\mathsf{T O}/\\mathsf{\\bar{T}O}$  PEN-based and all-carbon-electrode-based flexible solar cells as a function of bending cycles. c) Efficiency stability of the standard and all-carbonelectrode-based flexible PSCs as a function of soaking time in different conditions c) in ambient atmosphere under AM 1.5G illumination in air without  UV filter, and d) in ambient atmosphere with constant heating temperature of   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .  \n\nThe commercial viability of flexible PSCs is strongly related  to their long-term stability when subjected to real working conditions. In particular, solar cells are normally operated under  light soaking and elevated temperatures. The photo stability of  the as-fabricated flexible PSCs was first examined under AM  1.5G irradiation in air (average temperature   $19\\pm3\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , average  relative humidity   $38\\pm6\\%$  ). For comparison, the photo stability  of the ITO/PEN-based flexible PSCs with Au (ITO/Au) or   $\\mathrm{Ag}$     $(\\mathrm{ITO/Ag})$   as back electrodes was also examined. The corresponding   $J{-}V$   curves of the control ITO-based solar cells is  shown in Figure S11 (Supporting Information). As shown in  Figure 4c, the all-carbon-electrode-based PSCs remained   $92\\%$    of their original value after  $1014\\,\\mathrm{h}$   light soaking, outperforming  the reference Au-based   $({\\approx}75{\\%})$   and Ag-based flexible solar cells   $({\\approx}61\\%)$  . The thermal stability of the as-fabricated G2-based  flexible PSCs was also evaluated by subjecting the devices to a  constant temperature in air. As shown in Figure 4d, when subjected to a continuous thermal treatment at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in dark and  in air, the PCEs were degraded to   $26\\%$   and   $52\\%$   of their initial values for Ag- and Au-based reference devices, respectively,  which could be ascribed to the irreversible changes caused by  the diffusion of metals into the perovskite layer and the accelerated moisture ingress at elevated temperatures.  In sharp  contrast, all-carbon-electrode flexible PSCs exhibited considerably enhanced performance preservation, remaining about   $89\\%$   of the initial PCE after   $1570\\textrm{h}$  , which is also significantly  better than that of flexible PSCs using Ag-mesh/conducting  polymer as transparent electrodes (decreased to   ${\\approx}75\\%$   after   $500\\,\\mathrm{h}$   at   $45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and   ${\\approx}23\\%$   after   $97\\,\\mathrm{h}$   at   $70\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  .  The enhanced  thermal stability of carbon-based solar cells in humid air can  be ascribed to two aspects. First, the carbon electrode layer  exerted a little effect on the perovskite underlayer. Second, the  thick and hydrophobic CSCNT layer   $(\\approx\\!1.2\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{m})$   combined with  spiro-OMeTAD provided a stable encapsulating layer to protect perovskite from moisture aggression. To confirm the latter  case, the humidity stability of perovskite films in CSCNT–spiroOMeTAD- and Au–spiro-OMeTAD-based solar cells (substrate:  graphene/PET) was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) charact eri z ation to determine if CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD provided  an enhanced protection of perovskite from moisture ingress.  To enable the characterization of the actually degraded perovskite films in flexible PSCs, CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD- and  Au–spiro-OMeTAD-based solar cells were first subjected to a  high humidity of   $70\\%$   in dark for   $300\\textrm{h}$  , after which CSCNT– spiro-OMeTAD and Au–spiro-OMeTAD were peeled off using  scotch tape and the remaining spiro-OMeTAD was subsequently removed via the immersion of perovskite film into  chl oro benzene solvent.  The detailed experiment procedure  can be found in the “Experimental Section.” As observed in  Figure S12 (Supporting Information), after   $300\\textrm{h}$   of exposure,  the most obvious change of perovskite film in Au-electrodebased solar cells was the appearance of a strong   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peak of  (001) face at   $12.5^{\\circ}$  , indicating that the   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   perovskite  experienced a severe degradation in Au-electrode-based solar  cells in a constant humidity of   $70\\%$  . In the case of perovskite  film in the CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, no discernible   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peak was observed after   $300\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$   of exposure, indicating that the thick CSCNT–\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
