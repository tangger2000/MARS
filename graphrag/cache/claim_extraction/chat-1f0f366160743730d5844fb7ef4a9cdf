The lowest detection limit of 1 single crystal X-ray detector is calculated to be 1.58-3.13 μGy_air·s^-1 at voltages bias of 10-50 V as shown in Figure 5f (The detailed process is shown in the Supporting Information). This detection limit is lower than that of the BA2EA2Pb3Br10 single crystal (≈5.5 μGy_air·s^-1).)\n##\n(person<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The authors of the study have successfully synthesized a novel lead-free iodide double perovskite ferroelectric: (DFPIP)4AgBiI8 (1).<|>In summary, we have successfully synthesized a novel lead-free iodide double perovskite ferroelectric: (DFPIP)4AgBiI8 (1).)\n##\n(geo<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The study mentions the use of a 2-mm-thick aluminum foil as an attenuator.<|>The attenuator is accomplished by inserting 2-mm-thick aluminum foil between the light source and the X-ray detector. Figure 5b shows the current–voltage (I-V) curve of the detector at different doses from 91.4 to 1470 μGy_air·s^-1. The current is somewhat asymmetric between positive and negative voltage, which is partially due to ion migration in the crystal. We compared the current response of crystal detector to X-ray by turning on/off X-ray at different dose rates (181-1470 μGy_air·s^-1) with different bias voltages of 5–50 V (Figure 5c). The device shows a clear switching ratio. Interestingly, the photo current is quite stable for the device, which is highly contrast to previously reported Pb-based perovskite crystal X-ray detectors. The observation indicates that ionic migration is relatively lower for the 1 crystal in contrast to previously reported Pb-based perovskite crystals. The relationship between X-ray photo current density and low dose rate (15.4-129.3 μGy_air·s^-1) of the detector is shown in Figure 5d. We found that the photo current density of the device increases linearly with the increase of X-ray dose rate at the same bias voltage. Higher voltage leads to larger linearity and higher sensitivity (ΔI/Δdose) is therefore achieved (Figure 5e). We obtained sensitivity of 188 μC·Gy_air^-1·cm^-2 at 50 V voltage. Note that this value is 230-fold higher than that of previously reported bromide double perovskite ferroelectric (chl oro prop yl ammonium 4AgBiBr8 single crystals (sensitivity of 0.8 μC·Gy_air^-1·cm^-2)), ninefold higher in contrast to the dominant X-ray detector products α-Se X-ray detectors (20 μC·Gy_air^-1·cm^-2), and even superior to newly emerged Pb-free perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 single-crystal detectors (105 μC·Gy_air^-1·cm^-2 at 50 V bias).)\n##\n(event<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The study mentions the comparison of the current response of the crystal detector to X-ray by turning on/off X-ray at different dose rates.<|>We compared the current response of crystal detector to X-ray by turning on/off X-ray at different dose rates (181-1470 μGy_air·s^-1) with different bias voltages of 5–50 V (Figure 5c).

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.
