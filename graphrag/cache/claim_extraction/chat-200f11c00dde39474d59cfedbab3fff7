Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Our results demonstrate  the remarkable effectiveness of the GB pass iv ation to address  several challenges at once.  \n\nWe introduce n-type or p-type semiconducting molecules  with Lewis base or acid functional groups to the  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   based  solar cells to passivate GBs within the bulk film.  Figure   1 a  illustrates the molecular structure and energy diagram of  these molecules, (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)  \n\n(PCBM),   (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-di cyano methylene)- indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hex yl phenyl)-dithieno[2,3-  $\\mathrm{d}{:}2^{\\prime}{,}3^{\\prime}{\\mathrm{-}}\\mathrm{d}^{\\prime}]$  -s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b ′ ]dith i oph ene)  (ITIC),   7,7 ′ -[4,4-Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4 H -silolo[3,2- b :4,5- b ′ ]dith i oph ene-2,6-diyl]bis[6-fluoro-4-(  $5^{\\prime}$  -hexyl $_{[2,2^{\\prime}}$  -bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[ c ]  [1,2,5]thi a diaz ole])   $(p{\\mathrm{-DTS}}({\\mathrm{FBTTh}}_{2})_{2}$   (abbreviated as DTS),   and BDT unit based DR3TBDTT (abbreviated as DR3T).   These semiconducting molecules have high charge mobility,  relatively wide tunability of their electronic properties,   and can be readily introduced into the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   film through  commonly used anti solvent drip approach.  The molecule– perovskite interaction was confirmed from solution-phase  absorption spectroscopy and solid-state Fourier transform  infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses (Figure S1, Supporting  Information), which indicate formations of PCBM-halide  radical  or Lewis adducts between   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   ions and Lewis  base functional groups carbonyl   $(\\mathrm{C=O})$   or cyano   $\\mathrm{(C}{\\equiv}\\mathrm{N)}$  ).  As  schematically shown in Figure 1b, the molecule–perovskite  interaction is responsible for trap state pass iv ation and intergrain carrier transport.  The PCBM-halide radical accounts  for eliminated Pb–I antisite defects;  whereas, the Lewis  adducts between   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   ions and Lewis base functional groups  from ITIC, DTS, and DR3T molecules passivate the Lewis  acid traps from under-coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   ions.  Hydrogen  bonding interaction between F, O, and N atoms in the mole­ cules and excess MA-associated defects at the GB are also  expected.  \n\nEnergy offset between the molecules and perovskite should  play a substantial role in trap state pass iv ation and intergrain  carrier transport (Figure 1c). This is aided by the fact that   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   has the conduction band minimum (CBM) of   $-3.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$  and the valence band maximum (VBM) of   $-5.4~\\mathrm{eV};$   and ambipolar charge transport character.  PCBM, ITIC, DTS, and  DR3T have the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)  of   $-4.2$  ,   $-3.8$  ,   $-3.3$  , and   $-3.6\\,\\mathrm{~eV~}$   and the highest occupied  molecular orbital (HOMO) of   $-6.0$  ,   $-5.5$  ,   $-5.1$  , and   $-5.4\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  ,  respectively.  The   $\\mathrm{p-n}$   junction should thus form at the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  –molecule interface when n-type PCBM or ITIC is  introduced, whereas the n–p junction forms when p-type  DR3T or DTS is introduced. The LUMO of n-type ITIC is quite  close energetically to the CBM of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  , with a small   $0.1\\;\\mathrm{eV}$  difference, while the HOMO of p-type DR3T is close to the  VBM of   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$  . This suggests that ITIC and DR3T should  make the trap state much shallower, yielding more facile electron (or hole) transport between adjacent perovskite grains  through ITIC (or DR3T) bridges.  This is also expected to  benefit charge separation at the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  –molecule junction  and charge transport by assisting the electrons and holes to  flow to the opposite electrode. By contrast, PCBM and DTS  possess larger energetic disparities with   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  . The LUMO  (HOMO) of n-type PCBM has a disparity of   $0.3\\;\\mathrm{eV}$     $(0.6\\;\\mathrm{eV})$   with  the CBM (VBM) of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  . Similarly, the HOMO (LUMO) of  p-type DTS has a disparity of   $0.3\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$     $(0.6\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}})$   with the VBM  (CBM) of   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$  . The large energetic disparities are expected  to form a barrier for charge injection of electrons (or holes)  from  $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   into PCBM (or DTS) and thus should not behave  as highly effective bridge for intergrain carrier transport.  \n\nFurthermore, we also speculate the added benefits of  improved environmental and thermal stability of devices  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/1622194d6dc6a8ecdecafdf8ff8eb91e7f55fc92557aca10767b6a509a858c5c-1723833039.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Schematic al model showing the concept of multipurpose GB pass iv ation. a) Molecular structure of the selecting semiconducting molecules  with Lewis acid or base functional groups and the corresponding energy diagrams in the completed device. b) Selective interactions between Lewis  acid or base functional groups and the   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   crystal facets. c) Energy offset dominated trap state pass iv ation and intergrain charge transport.  d) Retarded MA loss and moisture ingress through a GB by molecules.  \n\n(Figure 1d).
