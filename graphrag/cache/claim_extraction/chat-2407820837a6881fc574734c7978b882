Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Under a small grazing incidence, the spot was elongated into a  line on the sample surface in the longitudinal direction. By moving the  sample laterally, the diffraction from different areas of the film could be  measured. Eight lines were measured, and the step of each movement  was  $\\approx\\!1.5~\\mathsf{m m}$   and was controlled by a precision motor. 2D XRD patterns  were acquired by a MarCCD X-ray detector at a distance of   ${\\approx}263\\ \\mathsf{m m}$  from the sample, with an exposure time of   $20~s$  . A grazing incidence  angle of   $0.40^{\\circ}$   was adopted. The XRD patterns were analyzed using  the FIT2D software and displayed in scattering vector  $q$   coordinates. The  optical absorption, transmission, and reflection spectra of the perovskite  films were measured by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer  (SHIMADZU UV-1750). Photo luminescence spectra were measured by  using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600). Devices were  excited by a   $500\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   pulsed diode laser. Time-resolved PL spectra were  collected by using an FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments).  Surface topographies (AFM) were imaged using an atomic force  microscope (Keysight 5500). XPS was done using Al   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  (1486.61  eV)  X-rays and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. The factor analysis  of the XPS spectra was performed using the program XPSPEAK ver. 4.1.  The TRPL mapping (FLIM) was measured by using a laser scanning  confocal microscope (SouthPort, JadeMAT) with a   $100~\\times~{\\mathsf{N A0.9}}$  objective. The detection system consisted of a VIS to NIR PMT detector,  which has an IRF within 180  ps and a 1-AU pinhole. Meanwhile, a   $520\\;\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   pulsed laser was used with an 80 ps pulse width as the  light source and tuned to   $500~\\mathrm{~kHz}$   while performing the mapping  measurements. A time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)  system with the lowest time resolution of 4  ps was used. The  measurement of activation energy of ion migration was conducted in a  Lakeshore probe station under a vacuum   $(\\mathsf{I}.\\mathsf{I}\\times\\mathsf{I}0^{-4}~\\mathsf{P a})$  . The samples  were placed on a copper substrate with the temperature controlled by a  heater and then liquid He was injected. A semiconductor characterization  system (Keithley 4200-SCS) was used for the current measurement. The  current was extracted at   $\\rceil50\\ s$   after the voltage was switched on. During  the measurement, the devices were first cooled to  $\\daleth0~\\mathsf{K}$   for  $\\rceil\\textsf{h}$   and then  heated to the objective temperature. Every objective temperature was  stabilized for 5 min before the current recording.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nW.H., Y.Y., and Q.X. contributed equally to this work.
