The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.

Then the MA gas was produced  by the reaction between NaOH and MACl and served as the  conversion atmosphere. In this process, the MA molecules  diffused into the   ${\\mathrm{HALT}}_{3}$   film. This route can be explained  as the in situ organic cation exchange reaction shown below: \n\n  $\\mathrm{NH_{2}N H_{3}S n I_{3}\\Delta\\left(s\\right)}+\\mathrm{\\DeltaCH_{3}N H_{2}\\Delta\\left(g\\right)}=\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}S n I_{3}}$   $\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!(s)\\!+\\!\\!\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   $(l)$  .
