For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type.

These transitions affect the Brillouin zone  (BZ) boundaries of the cubic unit cell. The out-of-phase and inphase rotations are at the R-point   $(1/2\\;1/2\\;1/2,\\,\\mathrm{R}_{4}{}^{+})$   and M-point \n\n  $(1/2\\ 1/2\\ 0,\\:\\mathrm{M}_{3}{}^{+})$  . The cubic–tetragonal transition occurs via the \n\n  $\\mathrm{R}_{4}^{\\mathrm{~+~}}$   rotational distortion mode, and the tetragonal–ortho rhombi c  transition is mainly associated with a combination of the   ${\\mathrm{R}}_{4}^{\\,\\,+}$  and   ${{\\bf{M}}_{3}}^{+}$   distortion modes. The   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cations do not reflect the  distortions of the lead iodide octahedra, caused by the structural  phase transition; these phase transitions are associated with the  formation of lattice vectors and a larger unit cell in   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  .  \n\nRecently, many investigations and developments have used   $C s^{+}$   and  $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   mixed with   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   A-site cations for solar cell applications or electro luminescent devices.  Currently, understanding the crystal phase transition mechanisms for   $\\mathrm{Cs^{+}}.$   and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  -based HMHP materials such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   and   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$   is an  important research trend.  According to Eperon et al.,  the  yellow phase of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   is the ortho rhombi c structure ( Pnma ),  whereas the black phase of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   is the cubic structure   $(P m{\\cdot}3m)$  . Similar observations have been made for   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$  ,  but the crystal phases in the studied temperature range were  not the same.  For example, the yellow- and black-colored  phases have been assigned to hexagonal and quasi-cubic/cubic  phases, respectively.  In general, the yellow phases of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  and   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   crystals are thermodynamic ally stable, unlike the  black phases of those crystals. In fact, a partially yellow phase  of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   surrounding the black phase in bulk thin films was  observed after thermal treatment.  The mixed A-site cations  in substituted HMHP materials have been assumed to consist  of different grains, into which the distinct structures are separated. When the crystals and molecules/atoms have blended  with each other, they undergo a thermodynamic ally driven  phase separation, with elemental segregation s based on chemical and physical affinities.  Thus, HMHP materials using  mixed A-site cations remain intrinsically unstable. Furthermore, when mixtures form, it is not known how the individual  compounds and crystal phases interact. This will be a key issue  for future investigations.  \n\n# 2.3. Phase Stability of Crystalline   $\\mathsf{F A P bI}_{3}$   and Chemical  Stabilizers  \n\nWe have discussed the crystal properties of common HMHP  materials such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{FADI}_{3}$  . Amongst these  materials,   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   crystals are often used in solar cell devices, as  the light absorbers. Many reports indicate that it is not possible  to sustain the   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}}$   phase for long periods, as shown in  Figure   3 a.  Han et al. reported  a gradual color change from  yellow to black, during treatment at   $185~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $2~\\mathrm{min}$  . After the  formation of black   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}.$  , a slow reversion to the yellow phase  occurred over 10 days. Furthermore, thermo grav i metric analysis  (TGA) and differential scanning calo rime tri y (DSC) data were  measured for the   $\\mathrm{FADI}_{3}$   system, from 100 to   $550~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   at a heating  rate of   $5~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$   in an Ar atmosphere, as shown in Figure   $2\\mathrm{b}$  .  The   $\\delta$  to $\\alpha$  crystal phase transition of   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   occurs without any  mass loss at   $185~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . This crystal thermally decomposes at temperatures between 375 and  $420~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . In this study, one key observation  was that pure   $\\mathscr{\\alpha}\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$   could not be sustained for a long term.  Therefore, pure   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   is not suitable for solar cell applications.  \n\nTo improve the stability of the crystal phase of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , various  additives have been used. We have reported the stabilization of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   by adding   $5~\\mathrm{mol}\\%$   or more of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   to   $\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3},^{[7]}$   or  by dropping an iso prop an ol solution, in which FAI and MABr  are dissolved, on a pre deposited   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   thin layer.  Binek et al.  attempted to identify the origin of the structural stability of the \n\n  ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedra on the addition of MAI during the formation of \n\n  $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   crystals.  As shown in Figure 3c, they prepared a pure \n\n  $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$   phase, which was confirmed by XRD. The   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{FA}}\\mathrm{bl}_{3}$  phase was then formed by the addition of   $15\\%$   MAI to the precursor. Thus, the chemically stable   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}}$   phase was prepared  after the annealing process; this was confirmed by matching with  the theoretical XRD pattern of   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{FA}}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   shown in Figure  3c.  They determined that the dipole moment of   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  cations is  10-times larger than that of the   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  cations surrounding the   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedra, as shown in Figure 3d) Zheng et al. reported a  very similar approach using MABr instead of MAI.  The insertion of MABr into   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\mathrm{\\mathrm{-}F A P b I}_{3}$   increased the crystallographic order,  as shown in Figure 3e. The Williamson–Hall   $\\mathrm{phot}^{\\bar{7}2}$   of   $(\\Delta d_{\\mathrm{obs}}{}^{2}$   $-~\\Delta d_{\\mathrm{ins}}{}^{2})^{1/2}$   versus the inter planar spacing of different planes is  shown for the case of MABr-containing   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   crystals, demonstrating the uniformly distributed   $d$  -spacing compared with those  of pure   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{bI}_{3}$   and   $\\delta{\\mathrm{-FAPbl}}_{3}$  . The Zheng group proposed a  model for the equal   $d$  -spacing in   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{FA}}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   after MABr insertion,  which is shown in Figure 3e (bottom left) and compared with\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
