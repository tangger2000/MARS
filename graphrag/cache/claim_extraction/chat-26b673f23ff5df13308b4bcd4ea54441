Under the same condition, however, the   $\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{Pb}$   experiences slow decline (Figure 4i), which demonstrates  relatively more homogenous distribution of   $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$   inside perovskite grains. Accordingly,   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Li^{+}}$  are more inclined to  bind with halide ions near the surface of perovskite film, while   $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$   can anchor the halide ions throughout the bulk (Figure S18,  Supporting Information). Particularly, implementing effective modification for the bottom perovskite surface is also of  great importance for improving device performance owing to  the high tendency to generate defects just as the top surface.  Therefore, the additive BAP has the best capability of minimizing the crystal defects during the perovskite crystallization  among the materials in the same family for mixed-halide blue  PeLEDs.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated an effective defect passivation strategy by employing a promising family of bi functional  benzoates to improve the photo physical property of mixed-halide  blue perovskite films. These additives are composed of electrondonating benzoic acid anions and alkali metal cations, which can  simultaneously mitigate the trap-induced non radiative recombination and halide ion migration. Among these benzoates, BAP is  able to generate more homogenous spatial distribution of alkali  metal ion throughout the perovskite film, thereby contributing  to comprehensive defect pass iv ation for perovskite grains. Consequently, high-efficiency sky-blue PeLEDs exhibit a high EQE  of   $16.58\\%$   and a maximum EQE of   $18.65\\%$   with spectrally stable  EL emission at   $483\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . This work provides a rational additive  engineering for boosting the performance of mixed-halide blue  PeLEDs and pointed out the significance of delicately designing  the functional groups of pas siva tors.  \n\n# 4.
