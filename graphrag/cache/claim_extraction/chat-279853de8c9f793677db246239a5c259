Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The longer   $\\tau_{2}$   also reflects  high-quality QD films with less non radiative recombination  centers, which is favorable to reduce the trapping of excitons  and enhance the recombination efficiency of electrons and  holes.  \n\nThe robustness of highly luminescent properties and effective electrical injection and transportation features of QD films  are expected to reach high exciton recombination efficiency in  devices. The device performance of QLED based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs is presented in  Figure   3 . The device (Figure 3a) consists  of multiple layers arranged in the following order: indium  tin oxide (ITO), poly(ethylene di oxy thi oph ene):polystyrene  sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS,   $40\\;\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ), poly (bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl) amine) (PTAA,   $40\\;\\mathrm{~\\nm})$  ), perovskite QDs   $(40\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~\\textrm~{~\\,~}~}}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{nm}})$  1,3,5-Tris(1-phenyl-  $.1H$  -benz imi daz ol-2-yl)benzene \n\n (TPBi)   $(40\\;\\mathrm{\\nm})$  , and LiF/Al   $(1/100\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  . The hole-transport  layer of PTAA used here takes the advantage of relatively high  hole mobility  to achieve high efficiency (Figure S15, Supporting Information). Figure 3b presents the typical EL spectrum of devices containing   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   and FA-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    QDs with peaks located at 513 and   $515\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , respectively. The  EL shows narrow emission   $(\\mathrm{FWHM}=18~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) and high color  purity. The devices exhibited saturated and pure color at green  wavelengths, and corresponding Commission Internationale  de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromatic it y coordinates of (0.05, 0.71) and  (0.09, 0.71) (Figure S16, Supporting Information). The change  in EL and CIE indirectly confirms that the FA dopant is indeed  introduced into the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   crystal lattice.  \n\nWe further measured the current–voltage   $(I{-}V)$   curve of the  devices (Figure 3c) and found that the control devices (without FA  cation) show higher current. After introducing the   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   dopant,  the currents of the devices reduce slightly, indicating suppression  of the charge imbalance. The voltage-dependent luminance of  QLEDs exhibits a minor increase in turn-on voltage (Figure S17,  Supporting Information) after   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   incorporation, which could be  ascribed to a deeper valence band of FA-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$     $(5.96\\;\\mathrm{eV})$    compared to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   (5.67  eV) (Figure S18, Supporting Information). Obviously, the QLEDs based on FA-doped  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs  have much higher luminance than those based on pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  .  The luminance of the doped device increases with voltage and  reaches a maximal value of   $55800\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   at  $5.8\\;\\mathrm{V}.$  .  \n\nCombining the high luminance with small currents, the  current efficiencies of FA-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QLEDs exhibit a  larger peak value of 45.4 cd   $\\mathrm{A}^{-1}$  , much higher than that of pure \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   (Figure 3d).

An excess  amount of FA composition ally mixed with   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   leads to a  decrease in LED performance (Figure S19, Supporting Information), attributed to poor morphology of QD films originating  from poor inks (Figures  S12 and S20, Supporting Information). Importantly, these devices exhibit high reproducibility  (Figure S21, Supporting Information). We obtain an average  peak EQE from 40 QLED devices, as high as   $11.2\\%$  .

Meanwhile, QD films with fewer non radiative recombination  centers exhibit higher PL features after introducing a small  amount of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   dopant. With this formulation, we demonstrate that the electro luminescent LEDs based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs  exhibit a peak EQE of   $11.6\\%$   and a peak current efficiency of \nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
