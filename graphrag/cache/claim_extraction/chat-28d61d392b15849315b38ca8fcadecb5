{"result": "## (ZnO<|>NONE<|>MATERIAL PROPERTY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>ZnO is a semiconductor material with a wide bandgap, which makes it suitable for various optoelectronic applications. The properties of ZnO can be influenced by the presence of defects, such as vacancies, interstitials, and antisites. These defects can affect the electrical and optical properties of ZnO, making it important to study and control them for optimal device performance.<|>ZnO, which are Zn vacancies (V_Zn), oxygen vacancies (V_O), zinc interstitial (Zn_i), oxygen interstitials (O_i), zinc antisites (Zn_O), and oxygen antisites (O_Zn). Among them, V_O, Zn_i, and Zn_O are donor defects and V_Zn, O_i, and O_Zn are acceptor defects. Besides the defect level position, the effect of defects on ZnO properties also depends on the defect concentration. The concentration of defects is not an eternally fixed constant because the formation energy of defects will change under different conditions. The relationship between formation energy and concentration of defects is shown Equation (1) C = N_sites exp(-E^f/(k_B T)) Where N_sites is the number of sites (including different configurations) per unit volume the defect can be incorporated on, E^f is the formation energy of defects, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. The formula reveals a negative exponential relation between defect concentration C and formation energy E^f, which means that a higher formation energy will lead to a lower equilibrium defects concentration. According to the theoretical calculation and experimental results of Oba et al. and Kohan et al., in N type ZnO, V_O shows the lowest formation energy of 0.02 eV and has the largest concentration. Zn_i also has relatively low formation energy and high concentration. Because of the high formation energy of V_Zn, O_i, and O_Zn, the concentrations of these acceptor defects are very low. As a result, the V_O and Zn_i play key roles in ZnO. Besides these point defects, when perovskite materials deposited on ZnO surface, the large lattice mismatch at ZnO perovskite interface can be observed, which has been verified by the computational analysis. The surface state of ZnO film is another source of recombination. At the surface, the crystal structure of ZnO is abruptly interrupted, which forms a large amount of dangling bonds and defects. This problem is particularly obvious in ZnO nanostructures because of the significant increased specific surface area; for example, 30% of the atomic bonds in ZnO nanoparticles are dangling bonds. In addition, once exposed to the air, oxygen and H_2O in the air will be absorbed by ZnO surface, which will also form a recombination center on the surface. In addition, the adsorbate and ZnO surface formed a structure similar to a Schottky barrier due to the charge transfer between adsorbates and the ZnO surface, which changes the carrier concentration within the surface space charge region. Some adsorbates such as OH molecules lead to band bending and charge accumulation near the ZnO surface, which will change the surface conductivity. Besides being mentioned above, the fabrication process, especially for the solution process, will introduce new defects. ZnO materials prepared by chemical methods, such as the hydrothermal method, chemical bath deposition, and sol–gel method, are not likely pure crystals, and organic species and chemicals from the precursor solutions used in the fabrication process will be left or absorbed on ZnO surface. These defects mentioned above can reduce the performance of PSCs by providing extra recombination pathways so that the incident light cannot be converted to electricity. The defects induce deep energy levels in ZnO band gap and give rise to a high density of recombination centers, which will reduce the lifetime of photo generated carrier and the quantum efficiency of PSCs. The result of such a process is the increased inner resistance and large dark current of PSCs, and the decreased photo current. Furthermore, the surface conduction layer induced by the surface absorption of ZnO can affect the carrier extraction at the perovskite /ZnO interface, which will also decrease the photo current and open circuit voltage of PSCs. Due to serious impacts of these defects, the characterization of defects is necessary. The common method to investigate defects include PL, TRPL, EIS, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Since the systematic studies about these methods have been widely reported, readers can refer to relevant information in the references. Besides the recombination, another serious problem is the poor stability of ZnO based PSCs. Perovskite materials are known to be sensitive to water and oxygen in the air but thermally stable under some conditions. However, according to research of other authors and our group, perovskite deposited on ZnO is easy to decompose during thermal treatment. Such phenomenon is not found between SiO_2 and \\AA PbI_3. This is mainly because of the different surface properties of ZnO materials. The surface of SiO_2 showed slightly acidic while the surface of ZnO exhibits basic behavior. Once perovskite contacts with ZnO, deprotonation reaction against methylammonium cation happens, which is the root of instability, and this assumption has been proved by theoretical calculations. Another important reason for instability is chemical residues from fabrication processes. ZnO materials especially nanomaterials used for PSCs are usually synthesized by chemical solution methods, therefore, the chemicals in the solution are unavoidably left on the ZnO surface. According to the research of Yang et al. and Cheng et al., the hydroxyl groups and residual acetate from the growth solution exacerbate the decomposition of perovskite. This is because the ZnO materials synthesized by the solution process are not completely oxidized, and the surface of the obtained ZnO nano materials is covered with chem is or bed oxygen species like hydroxide, which could break the ionic interaction between CH_3NH_3^+ and PbI_3^- and destroy the crystal structure of the \\AA PbI_3 sequentially. This process can be explained by the reaction formula as follows OH^- + CH_3NH_3I -> CH_3NH_3OH + I^- CH_3NH_3OH -> CH_3NH_2↑ + H_2O(heat) Obviously, the reaction between hydroxide on the CH_3NH_3I can directly decompose the perovskite under annealing.

The choice of ZnO as a substrate material is due to its compatibility with perovskite materials and its ability to provide a suitable interface for charge extraction and transport. The deposition process involves controlling parameters such as temperature, time, and precursor concentration to achieve the desired film quality and thickness. The resulting ZnO layer serves as a platform for the subsequent deposition of perovskite materials, which are responsible for the light absorption and charge generation in PSCs.<|>ZnO materials prepared by chemical methods, such as the hydrothermal method, chemical bath deposition, and sol–gel method, are not likely pure crystals, and organic species and chemicals from the precursor solutions used in the fabrication process will be left or absorbed on ZnO surface.)\n## (ZnO<|>NONE<|>CHARACTERIZATION METHOD<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>ZnO films and structures are commonly characterized using various techniques to assess their quality, composition, and properties.

The stability of ZnO-based PSCs is also an important factor, as they can maintain their performance over a long period of time under various environmental conditions.

These charge carriers are then separated and transported to the respective electrodes by the ZnO layer. The electrons flow through the ZnO layer to the cathode, while the holes flow through the perovskite layer to the anode. The movement of charge carriers is facilitated by the formation of a depletion region at the interface between the ZnO and perovskite layers, which creates an electric field that drives the separation of charges.

This  process can be explained by the reaction formula as follows  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{OH^{-}+C H_{3}N H_{3}I\\rightarrow C H_{3}N H_{3}O H+I^{-}}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{OH}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\uparrow+\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\\left(\\mathrm{heat}\\right)\n$$  \n\nObviously, the reaction between hydroxide on the   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{I}$  can directly decompose the perovskite under annealing.  Along with the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   introduced deterioration, the decomposition process of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}/\\$  perovskite system accelerates at elevated  temperatures.  \n\nFurthermore, according to our research, the performance  of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
