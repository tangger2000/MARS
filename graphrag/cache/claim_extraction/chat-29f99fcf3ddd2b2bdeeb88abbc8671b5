Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This indicates that even for the   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   single-doped perovskite  QDs, quantum cutting emission process may also occur. The  codoping of  $\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{e}^{3+}$   accelerates the happening of quantum cutting  emission process, as one of the most famous RE pairs.  The  optimum PLQY for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}{\\mathrm{·}}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}\\ (7.2\\%)$  ,   $\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{e}^{3+}\\ (2\\%)$   is as  high as   $146\\%$  , which is the highest value for the practical measurement in quantum cutting materials (see Table S3 in the  Supporting Information). Excitation spectra of RE doped perov­ skite QDs monitored at   $988~\\mathrm{nm}$   are as shown in Figure 2c. All  the excitation spectra exhibit a similar configuration, and show  little difference compared with the spectrum of undoped perov­ skite QDs monitored at   $455~\\mathrm{nm}$  . It means that the emission of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions at   $988\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   comes from the excitation of the perovskite  QDs through possible quantum cutting populating. Figure 2d  shows the dynamics of undoped and RE-doped perovskite QD  monitored at   $450~\\mathrm{nm}$  . The lifetime of Yb   $(7.1\\%)$   doped perov­ skite QDs decreases obviously compared to the undoped QDs,  indicating energy transfer from perovskite host to   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$  ions.  Further doping with   $2\\%$   Ce leads the lifetime of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$    host decrease to   $2.0~\\mathrm{ns}$  , which confirms the assistance of   $\\mathrm{Ge}^{3+}$    ions in the energy transfer process. Meanwhile, the lifetime  of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions at   $988\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   in Yb   $(7.1\\%)$   and Ce   $(2\\%)$   codoped  perovskite QDs (Figure 2e) increases about   $5\\%$  , indicating the  population at the  $\\mathrm{{}^{2}F_{7/2}}$   state of   ${\\mathrm{Yb}}^{3+}$   ions is accelerated with the  assistance of   $\\mathrm{Ge}^{3+}$   ions. The lifetime of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions emission in   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$  : Yb   $(7.1\\%)$  , Er   $(1.7\\%)$   QDs (Figure 2e) decreases  to about   $1365~\\ensuremath{\\upmu\\mathrm{s}}$   compared to   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Si}$  Yb   $(7.2\\%)$   QDs,  suggesting effective energy transfer from   $\\mathrm{{}^{2}F_{7/2}}$   state of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$    ions to   $^{4}\\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$   state of   $\\mathrm{Er^{3+}}$   ions occur.  \n\nThe mechanism of down-conversion process for   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$    codoped perovskite QDs is shown in Figure 2f. The electrons  are excited to the conduction band of perovskite host by the   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$   light. Part of electrons relaxes to the level which suits  at twice the energy level of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions. Then two electrons are  pumped to the  ${^2}\\mathrm{F}_{7/2}$   state of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions and radiated to  ${^2}\\mathrm{F}_{9/2}$   state  of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions. In the presence of   $\\mathrm{Ge}^{3+}$   ions, electrons on the  conduction should relax to the 5d state of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   ions and then  transfer to the  $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions.  \n\nThe RE-doped perovskite QDs were explored as a downconveter to enhance the performance of the SSCs because of  their excellent quantum-cutting properties and the exact spectral matching with SSCs ( Figure   3 a). They were self-assembled  on the surface of the commercial single crystal SSCs (area:   $125~\\mathrm{mm}\\times125~\\mathrm{mm}$  ) via liquid-phase deposition and the thickness was controlled ranging from 60 to   $770\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   (Figure S5,  Supporting Information). The perovskite film was quite flat,  which could reduce the scattering of the layer to the light  (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Figure 3b display the UV– vis transmittance spectra of the perovskite QDs layers, which  indicate that the transmittance of the layers decreases with the  increasing thickness of the layers. As the thickness is controlled  less than   $230~\\mathrm{nm}$  , the transmittance in range of   $450{-}1000\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    is as high as   $80–90\\%$   in the optimum response region of  the SSCs, implying weak influence on the light harvesting  of SSCs. Above   $230\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , the transmittance at the visible and  infrared region quickly decreases. Irradiated by an AM 1.5G  standard sunlight with a   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   short-pass filter, bright blue  emission can be observed for the perovskite layer   $(\\approx\\!230\\ \\mathrm{nm})$    (Figure   $\\mathsf{3c_{1},c_{3}}.$  ). The infrared emission can be recorded as a  pink color in the picture with an infrared camera (Figure   $3\\mathsf{c}_{2}$  ;  Figure S7, Supporting Information). This directly indicates that  the UV light can be effectively converted to infrared light by  perovskite film. Figure 3d shows the  I – V  curves of the SSCs  coated with different perovskite films. Compared to   $18.1\\%$    PCE of the uncoated SSCs, the performance for the 110, 210,  and   $350\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   perovskite QDs-coated samples increase to different contents, while the further increasing thickness of the  QDs induces the decrease of solar cell performance. For the  SSCs with   $230\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   perovskite QDs coating, the PCE reaches to \n\n  $21.5\\%$  , with open-circuit voltage   $0.65~\\mathrm{V}$   and short-circuit current \n\n  $39.8\\mathrm{\\mA^{-2}}$  . To check repeatability, the performance of ten  SSCs coated with   $230~\\mathrm{nm}$   perovskite QDs were measured randomly. The PCEs of SSCs distributed in the range of   $20.5{-}21.5\\%$    and the relative enhancement varied ranging from   $17.9\\%$  to   $18.8\\%$  , indicating a good reproducibility (Figure S8 and Table S4,  Supporting Information). The long time stability of the perovskite QDs and the perovskite QDs coated SSCs was also  studied. In the dark, the luminescent intensity of the perovskite  QDs decreased less than   $5\\%$   and the PCE of SSCs with   $230\\;\\mathrm{nm}$    perovskite QDs coating decreased only about   $5\\%$   after placed  in the air for   $700\\textup{h}$  , indicating a high stability (Figure S9a,b,  Supporting Information).
