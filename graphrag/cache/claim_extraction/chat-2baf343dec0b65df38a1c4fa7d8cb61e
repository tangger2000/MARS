For thermo chromic smart window application, the  thermo responsive behavior of halide per ovsk ites is based on  their unusual crystallization behavior, also known as inverse  temperature crystallization (ITC).  Unlike the majority of substances, the solubility of per ovsk ites decreases as the solution  temperature increases, resulting in single crystal cell nucleation and growth of perovskite single crystals (Figure 6a). As the  temperature increases, perovskite crystals gradually precipitate,  accompanied by an absorbance band gap shift and optical property change.  \n\nIt is the halogen constituent that determines the crystallization temperature of halide per ovsk ites; therefore, introducing more than one halide constituent can enable further  control of the thermo chromic behavior of halide perovskite  solutions. Pioneering work on per ovsk ites for smart window  applications was by De Bastiani et  al., using a bi constituent   $\\mathrm{\\ttMAPbBr}_{3-x}\\mathrm{\\ttI}_{x}$   perovskite solution.  As the solution temperature was varied from 25 to   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the color changed from  yellow to black due to the different precipitation rates of black  iodine–based perovskite and orange bromide–based perovskite. The solubility of iodine-based perovskite drops much  more rapidly than that of the other, therefore   $_x$   increases with  increasing temperature in the precipitates. Upon temperature elevation to   $120\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C},$  , the iodine-based perovskite dominated and the color turned black. During the thermo chromic  process of halide perovskite solution, the absorption spectrum varied significantly. The main absorption spectrum was   $250{-}780\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , which includes visible light and part of the UV  region. Similar phenomena associated with halide perovskite  materials have also been reported in other papers.  This light  modulation is due to the absorption of photons by transition  metal ions from the precipitate, which is affected by precipitate size and composition.  Figure 6b shows the absorption  spectrum of perovskite crystals at three different temperatures. As the temperature was increased, a redshift of the  absorption edge was observed. Figure 6c,d shows the thermochromic smart window prototype produced by De Bastiani  et al. and its absorption spectrum after annealing at the indicated temperature. At   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the absorption maximum of the  prototype (Figure 6d) matched well with the absorption maximum of the perovskite powder (Figure 6b). However, when  the prototype was heated to   $90~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the absorption maximum  position was observed with a redshift from 400 to   $700\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$    compared with   $620\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   of the powder sample. Additionally, the  stability of this system requires further exploration since the  band edge displayed variations over several cycles of   $25{-}60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    heating and cooling (Figure 6e). Sarkar and co-workers reported  the reversible thermo chromic behavior of thin film dehydrate  methyl ammonium lead iodide.  With increasing temperature  from 25 to   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the film demonstrated a significant absorption enhancement caused by a shift in the absorption maximum from   ${\\approx}400$   to  ${\\approx}500\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , accompanied by a distinct color  variation from transparent to dark orange.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/41c6901efca5bd763c20456a9f210328f6f3d76c91d86771168e613a3f20e21c-1727078072.jpg)  \nFigure 6.   a) Schematic illustration of the ITC process of perovskite materials: with increasing temperature, the perovskite crystals nucleate and grow.  b) Absorption spectra of perovskite crystals obtained from inks at 60, 90, and   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  . c) Photographs of thermo chromic prototype annealed at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  (top) and  $60\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (bottom). d) Absorption spectra of the thermo chromic prototype after annealing at the indicated temperature. e) Band edge alternation  of the thermo chromic prototype during heating and cooling cycles between 25 and   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}.$  .
