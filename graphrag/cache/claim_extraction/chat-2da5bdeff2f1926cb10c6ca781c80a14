The detailed device fabrication pro­ cedure was given in the Experimental Section. In this work,  AD, ADCA, and ADAA were used to modify   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2I}$  /perovskite  buried interface. As shown in  Figure    1 a, the   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   in these  modifiers should be able to interact with   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   in per ovsk ites  and   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   in   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  , which will be confirmed by different char­ act eri z ation techniques. The steric hindrance of the chemical  interaction between   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   and per ovsk ites as well as ETL gradu­ ally reduced from AD, ADCA to ADAA, which was expected to  have a significant effect on inter facial defect pass iv ation, stress  release, and inter facial carrier dynamics. First, Fourier trans­ form infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to study  the chemical interaction between inter facial molecules and \n\n  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   films (Figure 1b–f). It can be seen in Figure 1b that the \n\n  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   films without and with modifiers exhibited   $\\mathrm{Sn}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and  Sn   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   peaks. Obviously, the binding energy of   $\\mathrm{Sn}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and  Sn   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   peaks were shifted from 485.76 and 494.17 eV of the  pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film to 485.92 and   $494.33~\\mathrm{eV}$   of the AD-modified   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film, 485.94 and   $494.41~\\mathrm{eV}$   of the ADCA-modified   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$    film,   $486.10$   and   $494.49\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{~eV}}$   of the ADAA-modified   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film,  respectively. This indicates that chemical interaction occurred  between interface molecules and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film. Moreover, the  interaction strength was gradually intensified from AD, ADCA  to ADAA. It suggests that the smaller steric hindrance is, the  stronger the chemical interaction strength is. The large steric  hindrance is not conducive to the chemical interaction of modi­ fication molecules with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . As presented in Figure 1c, the O  1s peaks of control and modified   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   films could be deconvo­ luted into two peaks, where the peak at low binding energy orig­ inates from the lattice oxygen   $\\left(O_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right)$   of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and while the peak  at high binding energy belongs to vacancy oxygen   $(O_{\\mathrm{V}})$  .   The peak area ratio   $(R_{\\mathrm{OV}})$   of   $O_{\\mathrm{V}}$   was calculated according to our  previous report.  The   $R_{\\mathrm{OV}}$   values of control, AD-, ADCA-, and  ADAA-modified samples were 0.62, 0.56, 0.55, and 0.49, respec­ tively, which shows that oxygen vacancy defects were effectively  passivated after modification. Furthermore, the concentrations  of oxygen vacancy defects were gradually reduced in the order  of AD-, ADCA-, and ADAA-modified samples compared with  the control sample. The oxygen vacancy defect pass iv ation  effect is negatively correlated with the steric hindrance of modi­ fication molecules. Figure 1d–f illustrates FTIR spectra of the  pristine and modified   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   films and Figure  S1 (Supporting  Information) displays FTIR spectra of the AD, ADCA, and  ADAA molecules. The peaks at 2899 and   $2846~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   belonging  to stretching vibration peaks of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$  can be observed in all  modified samples whereas they were absent in control sample,  which confirmed the presence of modifiers in the final device.  The   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   stretching vibration peaks of AD   $(1715.0\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ), ADCA   $(1705.2\\,\\mathrm{\\cm^{-1}})$  , and ADAA   $(1709.5\\,\\mathrm{~cm}^{-1})$   were shifted toward  lower wave numbers for   $\\mathrm{AD}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$     $(1681.2~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ),   $\\mathrm{ADCA}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   \n\n  $(1669.2~\\mathrm{~cm}^{-1})$  ), and   $\\mathrm{ADAA}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   $(1667.5\\ \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ), respectively \n\n (Figure 1e). The stretching vibration peak of   $\\mathrm{Sn-O}$   in pristine \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   was   $701.4~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , which was shifted to   $694.7~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  of   $\\mathrm{AD}/$   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  ,   $694.1~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   of   $\\mathrm{ADCA}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  , and   $693.9\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}}$   of ADAA/\n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (Figure  1f). The above FTIR results again proved the  chemical interaction between   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   and   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  , which is con­ sistent with the previous XPS results. The interface molecules  can not only passivate the oxygen vacancies in the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   layer,  but also passivate the uncoordinated lead ions at the perovskite  interface. As shown in Figure  1g, the two peaks (137 .18 and   $142.08\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   corresponding to Pb   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Pb4f}_{5/2}$   in the con­ trol perovskite film, respectively, were shifted to higher binding  energies after modification with AD (137 .28 and   $142.13\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}})$  ,  ADCA (137 .31 and   $142.18~\\mathrm{eV})$  ), and ADAA (137 .37 and 142.21 eV).  This is suggestive of a strong chemical interaction between  modification molecules and the perovskite film. Moreover, the  chemical interaction strength of modifiers with per ovsk ites  gradually increased as the steric hindrance reduced in the order  of AD, ADCA, and ADAA. It was inferred that these modifica­ tion molecules can effectively passivate the under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  defects at the bottom surface of perovskite films. The  modifiers had the same chemical interaction strength change  tendency with perovskite and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . It can be concluded that  perovskite layer and ETL can be chemically linked after AD,  ADCA, and ADAA modification and inter facial contact can be  ameliorated.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/789eec2e79f6f6d3636e9be4dde440937aece6205e182dacdf8f2d02ef6376f6-1727104956.jpg)  \nFigure   1.   a) Molecular structures of modifiers and schematic diagram of inter facial defect pass iv ation by AD, ADCA, and ADAA. b) Sn 3d and c) O  1s   $\\mathsf{X P S}$   spectra of the  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   films without or with AD, ADCA, and ADAA modification.
