Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Thus,   $C s^{+}$   and   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   differ significantly in size, but the difference between the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   cations is small.  Moreover,   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   crystallizes in the tetragonal   $I4/m c m^{[44]}$   (or   $I4/c m^{[44]})$    space group, under the same temperature conditions, whereas   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   crystallizes in a hexagonal   $\\delta$  phase and pseudo cubic/ cubic   $\\alpha$  -phase. Many computational simulations have been  carried out to understand the interplay of the effective size,  structure, and organic/inorganic interactions. These are several  factors that influence the crystal structures and electrical properties of   $\\mathrm{APbI}_{3}$   per ovsk ites.  \n\nAmat et al. conducted  scalar relativistic (SR) density functional theory (DFT) simulations to compare tetragonal   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$    and triclinic   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , based on the experimental cell parameters, as shown in Figure  1b (top).

Based on their calculations of the  effective “ionic radius” for   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   cations in the   $\\mathrm{APbI}_{3}$    system, they determined the values of 1.81, 2.70, and  $2.79\\textup{\\AA}$   for   $C s^{+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  , respectively.

Furthermore, Amat et al. found that when the tetragonal   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   and hexagonal   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   systems are transformed  to the cubic phase, very similar bandgaps are achieved. However,   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   provides better electron/hole transport than that  by the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   system. It has been speculated that the substantial Rashba–Dress el haus effect  in non-centro symmetric  tetragonal crystal structures, which originates from spin–orbit  coupling, could contribute to the decrease in carrier recombination in these systems, thus increasing the solar cell efficiency.  \n\nAmong the HMHP solar cell devices using  $C s^{+}$  ,  $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$    in the  $\\mathrm{APbI}_{3}$   system,    $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$   solar cells exhibited  instability arising from heat and light exposure.
