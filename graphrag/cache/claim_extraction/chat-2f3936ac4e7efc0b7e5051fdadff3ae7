Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

In contrast,   $C12{\\cdot}C\\mathrm{s}P\\mathrm{b}I_{3}$   nano crystals  have better solubility in hexane but lower stability. (We had also  used C10 as ligands to synthesize   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   QDs, unfortunately,  the product showed no PL activity (the reason is still unclear).)  These results indicate that the chain length have great influence on the stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   nano crystals. For C2, C4, C6, C8,  and C12, the polarities of these ligands will decrease with the  increasing of chain length. In addition, larger polarity means:  a) stronger adsorption energy between those ligands and Cs, Pb,  and I atoms, which could enhance the ligand stability on QDs  surface and promote better structure stability; b) more destructive effect to the ionic structure, which could reduce the structure stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   nano crystals. Therefore, there should be  an equilibrium point between them. According to the abovementioned results, C8 should be the equilibrium point that can  receive the best stability, which shows the highest stability.  \n\nLikewise, the ratios of ligands to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and C8 to C18 have  significant effects on these properties of  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   QDs (Tables S1  and S2, Supporting Information). A lower ratio of ligands to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   might result in the insufficient capping on the QD surface  and poor cubic phase stability. Surprisingly,   $\\delta{\\mathrm{-}}{\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{Pb}}_{3}$   nanorods  form when the ratio of ligands to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   is 24 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). In addition, decreasing ratio of C8 to C18  results in reduced cubic phase stability, albeit the stability is still  better than that of the   ${C18}{\\cdot}{C}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs. A higher ratio of C8  to C18 leads to the formation of layered structures (Figure S3,  Supporting Information). Therefore, the optimal conditions  for producing high-stability   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs are to set the mole  ratios of ligands to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and C8 to C18 as 6 and 3, respectively.  \n\nHighly stable   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs were used as photoactive materials for fabricating PSCs.   ${\\mathsf{C18}}{\\cdot}{\\mathsf{C s P b I}}_{3}$   QD-based solar  cells were also fabricated for comparison.  Figure   6 a shows the  architecture of the as-fabricated device (Figure S4, Supporting  Information).

In addition  to the obvious enhancement in the PCE, a moderate reduction  in hysteresis between the reverse and forward scans for C8/C18-  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   QDs-based devices has also been observed (Figure S7  and Table S3, Supporting Information). The stabilized power  output (SPO) measurement shown in the inset of Figure 6b also  shows that the   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs-based solar cell   $(\\approx\\!11\\%)$   performs better than the   $\\mathsf{C18{-}C s P b I}_{3}$   QD-based device   $(\\approx\\!7\\%)$  . This  conclusion was further confirmed based on the statistical analysis of measurements from 20 devices (Figure S8, Supporting  Information). Figure 6c shows the external quantum efficiency  (EQE) spectra of the various devices. One can clearly see that  the   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   QD-based device performs better than the   ${C18}{\\cdot}{\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{PbI}}_{3}$   QD-based device, which confirms the higher   $J_{S C}$  value for the former. The charge transport properties in these  devices were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as shown in Figure 6d. The Nyquist plots show  that the charge transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{CT}})$   in the   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$  QD-based device   $(281\\ \\Omega)$   is obviously lower than that in the   ${\\mathsf{C18}}{\\cdot}{\\mathsf{C s P b I}}_{3}$   QD-based device   $(374\\ \\Omega)$  . Thus, shorter length  ligands could induce a higher charge transport rate. Therefore,  the high  $J_{S C}$   and FF of the   ${\\mathsf{C18}}{\\cdot}{\\mathsf{C s P b I}}_{3}$   QD-based device might  be attributed to the stronger and shorter capping ligands on the  corresponding QDs, which could reduce the concentration of  surface defects and promote charge transport, respectively.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn conclusion, we used a mixture of C8 and C18 as capping  ligands for synthesizing high-quality   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs. Our  results suggest that the stronger adsorption energy between the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   surface and C8 than that of C18 in   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs  produces much higher PLQY, fewer surface defects, and better  stability compared to   ${C18}{\\cdot}{C}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs. Moreover, the PL intensity of the   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs can maintain   ${\\approx}80\\%$   of its initial value for 180 days. In addition, the PCE of solar cells based  on these   $_{\\textrm{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}}$   QDs reached up to   $11.87\\%$  , which is  much higher than that of   $\\mathsf{C18{\\cdot}C s P b I}_{3}$   QD-based devices. These  results illustrate an effective method for enhancing the stability  of   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs and the charge transport rate of the corresponding devices, which could broaden the potential applications of all-inorganic perovskite materials.  \n\n# 4.
