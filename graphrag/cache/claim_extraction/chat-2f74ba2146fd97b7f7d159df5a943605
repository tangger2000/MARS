Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Same measurements were performed on   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, based on which, the  phase diagram is determined and plotted in Figure 2d. The  phase transition temperature   $T_{\\mathrm{O-T}}$   which relates to the oxygen  octahedron tilting, is found to increase with Ta addition, while   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{2}-M_{3}}}$   and   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{1}-M_{2}}}$  , which are associated with the cation (  $\\mathrm{Ag}$   and  Nb) displacements, exhibit contrary trend. Of particular interest  is that   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{3}-O}}$  , which is between   $T_{\\mathrm{O-T}}$  and   $T_{\\mathrm{M}_{2}-\\mathrm{M}_{3}},$  , remains the  same value with Ta addition. The constant   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{3}-O}}$   might be  due to the combined effects of oxygen octahedron tilting and  cation displacement. According to this phase diagram, samples  with   $x=15{-}20\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\%$   are in   $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$   phase at room temperature,  which might be mixed ferri electric and anti ferroelectric phases  because they are close to   $\\mathrm{M}_{1}\\mathrm{-M}_{2}$   phase boundary.  \n\nTo confirm the room-temperature anti ferro electricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, the polarization hysteresis and dielectric tunability were measured. It is observed that the AFE  to FE phase transition for pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics occurs at   $125\\;\\mathrm{kV}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , where both   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and   $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$   are found to increase with  increasing   $E$   field to   $150~\\mathrm{kV~cm}^{-1}$  , as given in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The nonzero   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   value in   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$  ceramic  is attributed to the FIE phase.  Meanwhile, the dielectric tunability of pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   shows a significant shape change as a  function of applied electric field   $(E_{\\mathrm{max}})$   from 50 to   $150~\\mathrm{kV}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  .  At low   $E_{\\mathrm{max}}$  of   $50\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\kV}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-1}}$  , the dielectric constant decreases  monotonously with increasing   $E$  field, while different dielectric  tunability behavior is observed at higher   $E_{\\mathrm{max}}$   over   $75\\;\\mathrm{kV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  . It  is worth noting a drop in the dielectric constant appears as   $E_{\\mathrm{max}}$  is above   $125\\ensuremath{~\\mathrm{kV}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}$   due to the AFE-FE phase transition. Generally, the dielectric constants of FE materials decrease with  increasing   $E$  field, being saturated at higher applied   $E$   field. For AFE materials, on the contrary, the dielectric constant first  increases linearly with increasing   $E$  field, while behaving nonlinearly at higher   $E$  field prior to AFE-FE phase transition.  Thus,   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramic exhibits both FE-like and AFE-like behavior in  dielectric tunability, which is associated with the FIE   $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$   phase.  \n\nThe AFE-FE phase transition can be observed in both the   $P{-}E$   loop and dielectric tunability in pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics at  E  field of   $150\\;\\mathrm{kV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , as shown in  Figure   3 a.

On the contrary,   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$  ceramic shows a slim   $P{-}E$   loop at the same  applied electric field, where AFE-like behavior  is found to coexist with FE-like behavior in  dielectric tunability curve prior to AFE-FE  phase transition (Figure 3b), while the FElike behavior disappears in dielectric tunability at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  (Figure 3d). Together with  transmission electron microscope (TEM)  image as given in  Figure   4 , this suggests  the weakened FIE phase in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})}$   $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   composition.
