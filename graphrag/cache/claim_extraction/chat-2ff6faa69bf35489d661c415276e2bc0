Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Furthermore, compared to QDs, dense thin  films can be more easily fabricated. Placa  et al. reported a low-dimensional perovskite  thin film with a very high PLQY of  $\\mathord{\\approx}80\\%$  .   However, the reported thin films based  on low-dimensional halides still contain  toxic Pb. Therefore, exploring a new luminescent material that meets the following  criteria is a challenging task: (i) non toxicity,  (ii) ease of fabrication of pinhole-free thin  films, and (iii) high PLQY. A comparison of the electronic structures between  conventional 3D and 0D luminescent  materials will help achieve this goal (cf. 3D   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  : exciton binding energy   ${\\approx}18\\ \\mathrm{meV},$     $\\mathrm{9D\\Cs_{4}P b B r_{6}}{:=}240\\;\\mathrm{meV})$  ).  In the case of  \n\nHalide per ovsk ites, including  $\\mathsf{c s P b X}_{3}$     $({\\mathsf{X}}={\\mathsf{C l}}$  , Br, I), have gained much  attention in the field of op to electronics. However, the toxicity of  $\\tt P b$   and the  low photo luminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these per ovsk ites hamper  their use. In this work, new halide materials that meet the requirements  of: (i) non toxicity, (ii) high PLQY, and (iii) ease of fabrication of thin films via the  solution process are explored. In particular, copper(I) halide compounds with  low-dimensional electronic structures are considered.   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{5}$   has a 0D  photo active site and exhibits blue emission   $(\\approx\\!445\\ \\mathsf{n m})$   with very high PLQYs  of  $\\scriptstyle{\\approx}90$   and  $\\scriptstyle{\\approx}60\\%$   for single crystals and thin films, respectively. The large  exciton binding energy of  $\\sim\\!\\!490$   meV explains well the 0D electronic nature of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{5}$  . Blue electroluminescence of Pb-free halides is demonstrated using  solution-derived  $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{5}$   thin films.  \n\nRecently, quantum dots (QDs) gained much attention owing to  their high photo luminescence quantum yield (PLQY) resulting  from the quantum confinement effect (QCE). However, the practical use of conventional QDs is hampered by several challenges:  (i) the toxicity of chemical elements such as Cd and Pb, (ii) the  difficulty in the fabrication of dense thin films, and (iii) high cost  owing to their complicated synthesis process.  On the other  hand, halide per ovsk ites such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   can be a good alternative to overcome these problems; dense thin films can be fabricated by a low-cost, simple solution process.  However, their  PLQYs are not as high as QDs, and the toxicity of Pb still remains  an issue to be resolved. Against this background, the use of lowdimensional materials is of great interest because the intrinsic  \n\n3D perovskite materials such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  , the conduction band  maximum (CBM) originates mainly from   $\\operatorname{Pb}\\,{\\mathfrak{G}}{\\mathfrak{p}}$   orbitals, while  the valence band maximum (VBM) originates from the admixed  Pb 6s and   $\\mathrm{~I~}5\\mathrm{p}$   orbitals. Thus, the 3D network of corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{[PbX_{6}]^{-4}}$   octahedra gives rise to large band dispersion, enabling  excitons to dissociate readily as evidenced by the low exciton  binding energy.  \n\nHowever,   $\\mathrm{Cs_{4}P b B r_{6}}$   possesses the spatially isolated   $\\mathrm{[PbBr_{6}]^{-4}}$    octahedron that is surrounded by   $C s^{+}$   ions, where excitons  are strongly confined to each   $\\mathrm{[PbBr_{6}]^{4-}}$   octahedron that may  be regarded as the core–shell structure as in QDs, in a sense.  This idea gives a perspective on the use of light elements for  which the spatial spread of the relevant atomic orbitals is sufficiently small to confine the exciton. Based on the above idea,  we focused on the copper(I) halide-based compounds because  their VBM primarily is composed of the admixed   $\\mathrm{Cu}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}$   and  halogen p orbitals. The dispersion of the VBM is much smaller  than that of the VBM composed of the hybridized   $\\mathrm{Pb\\,\\,6s\\,\\,+}$    halogen p orbitals in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  . The exciton binding energy of  copper (I) iodide was reported as   $62\\ \\mathrm{meV},$   which is larger than  that of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$     $(\\approx\\!18\\,\\mathrm{\\meV})$  .  This result implies that high  PLQY and high exciton binding energy will be attained if a  compound consisting of the spatially isolated   $\\mathrm{[Cu-I]}$   polyhedra  is chosen.  Kitada and Ishida reported a high PLQY of   $73\\%$   for polymeric CuI complexes.  This report suggests our  expectation for low-dimensional luminescent materials based  on copper  $\\mathrm{(I)}$   halides.  \n\nWe choose   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   as a candidate material that is nontoxic, low cost, and air-stable. Consequently, we found that this  material exhibits high PLQYs of 90 and   $60\\%$   for single crystals  and thin films, respectively.
