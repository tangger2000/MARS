Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In the case of perovskite  film in the CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, no discernible   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peak was observed after   $300\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$   of exposure, indicating that the thick CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD layer provided  an enhanced protection of perovskite from moisture ingress.  \n\nTherefore, the hydrophobic surface of CSCNT, as well as the  thick CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD layer, syne r gic ally inhibited the  moisture ingress, leading to the enhanced light soaking or  thermal stress stability in humid air.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, for the first time, all-carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs were fabricated with graphene as the front transparent anode and carbon nanotubes as the back electrode. By  using low-temperature synthesized   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   combined with PCBM  as electron extracting material, then all-carbon-electrode-based  flexible PSCs fabricated with and without spiro-OMeTAD hole  conductor showed PCEs of   $11.9\\%$   and   $8.4\\%$  , respectively. The  carbon-based flexible PSCs obtain   $86\\%$   of the original PCEs  even after 2000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of   $4~\\mathrm{mm}$  ,  significantly outperforming the conventional flexible PSCs fabricated with ITO/PEN transparent electrode and metal back  electrode. Moreover, the all-carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs  exhibited good performance preservation, retaining over   $90\\%$   of  their original efficiencies after   $1000{\\mathrm{~h~}}$   light soaking or thermal  stress in humid air. Considering the increasing efforts dedicated to developing low-cost and efficient flexible energy conversion devices, the promising efficiency, flexibility, and long-term  stability of all-carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs clearly demonstrate the sufficient compatibility of carbon materials with  flexible PSCs and highlight the potential of incorporating alternative electrode materials in achieving high efficiency, endurable, and large-scale perovskite photovoltaic devices.  \n\n# 4. Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : Graphene transparent electrodes were purchased from  2D Carbon (Changzhou) Tech. Inc., LTD, China, which were prepared  by transferring CVD synthesized graphene onto the PET substrates.  Perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving lab-synthesized  methyl ammonium iodide   $(\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}|)^{[8]}$   and   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   into dimethyl  sulfoxide/ N,N -dimethyl formamide (3:7, volume ratio). The total mass  concentration of perovskite precursor was  $40\\;\\mathsf{w t\\%}$  .  \n\nPreparation of   $\\boldsymbol{{\\cal T}i O_{2}}$   Nano crystal :   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   was synthesized by a lowtemperature nonaqueous route.  Briefly,   $1~\\mathsf{m L}$   of   ${\\sf T i C I}_{4}$   solution was  slowly added to   $4\\;\\mathsf{m L}$   of ethanol under stirring; then   $20\\;\\mathsf{m L}$   of anhydrous  benzyl alcohol was added to the mixture solution. After vigorous stirring  for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$  , the solution was heated to   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for a period of   $8~\\mathsf{h}$  . After  cooling down naturally to ambient temperature,   $2~\\mathsf{m L}$   of the resulting  suspension was slowly added to  $\\mathsf{18~m L}$   of diethyl ether. The as-obtained  precipitation was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and washed with acetone.  Then   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   was re dispersed in ethanol by sonication   $(2\\,\\mathsf{w t\\%})$  . To enhance  the adhesive properties of   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   nanoparticles, a small amount of  titanium di-iso prop oxide bis(acetyl ace to nate) was added to the colloidal \n\n  $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   dispersion.  \n\nFabrication of CSCNT : Highly super aligned CNT arrays (length: \n\n  ${\\approx}300\\ \\ {\\upmu\\mathrm{m}})$  ) were first prepared on silicon wafers by chemical vapor  deposition using iron as the catalyst and acetylene as the precursor  according to the previous method.  The substrate was placed in the  tube furnaces and then heated up to   $680–720\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  in the flowing argon  gas for   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . Subsequently, hydrogen and acetylene were injected  into reaction system. Super aligned arrays can be obtained under the  conditions of 500 sccm acetylene plus 50 sccm hydrogen. CSCNT  films were fabricated by cross-stacking the super aligned CNT arrays  on a metallic frame.  The CSCNT films were shrunk and tightened by  dipping them into ethanol for   $\\updownarrow0\\textsf{s}$  . The CSCNT electrode exhibited a  sheet resistance of  $41\\pm1.8\\;\\Omega\\;{\\sf s q}^{-1}$  .  \n\nDevice Fabrication :  $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   nano crystal was deposited on the graphene  substrates by spin-coating at 5000 rpm, and then drying at   $45\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   in  vacuum. PCBM with an optimized concentration of   $15\\,\\,\\mathrm{\\bar{m}g\\,\\,m L^{-1}}$   was  then spin-coated onto the   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   layer   $(5000\\ \\mathsf{r p m})$  . Subsequently, in an   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$  -purged glovebox, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated  onto the   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}/\\mathsf{P C B M}$   layer by two consecutive spin-coating steps of  1000 and 4000 rpm for 10 and   $45\\,\\mathrm{~s~}$  , respectively. About   $500~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   ethyl  acetate was rapidly dropped on the perovskite films after   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   of spincoating. The films were heated in a vacuum-drying cabinet at   $50~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $4\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$  . CSCNT films were then transferred onto perovskite layer with  the aid of several droplets of chl oro benzene. HTM was incorporated  from CSCNTs’ side. HTM solution was prepared by adding   $72.3\\ \\mathsf{m g}$   of  spiro-OMeTAD,   $28.8~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of 4-tert-but yl pyr i dine, and   $17.5~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of lithium  bis(tri flu oro methyl s ulf on yl)imide (  $(520~\\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$   in acetonitrile) to   $1\\,\\,{\\mathsf{m L}}$  of chl oro benzene. The fabricated devices were remained in drying air for   $48~\\mathsf{h}$   before test.  \n\nStandard flexible solar cells were fabricated by replacing the graphene  electrodes with ITO/PEN electrodes. The fabrication process of   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}/$  PCBM and perovskite layers on ITO/PEN substrates was similar to the  carbon electrode-based devices. Au or Ag electrode was deposited onto  the HTM layer by thermal evaporation.  \n\nCharacterization : The XRD pattern of   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   nano crystal was recorded  on a Bruker D8 Advance diffract o meter with Cu K α 1 radiation.
