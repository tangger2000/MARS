Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The perovskite surface of the PSCs was uncovered by carefully removing a gold (Au) electrode and a hole transport layer  (HTL)  of   ${}^{2,2^{\\prime},7,7^{\\prime}}$  -tetrakis[ N , N -di(4-meth oxy phenyl)amino]- 9,9 â€² -spiro bif luo rene (Spiro-OMeTAD). The morphology of the  S-3 film significantly changed after degradation, as shown in  FigureÂ  2b,c. The   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals being present in the original  perovskite film almost disappeared, and defects and pinholes  became more frequent. The disappearance of   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   in S-3  films was supported by XRD patterns, where the peak intensity at   $12.5^{\\circ}$   had significantly decreased (inset of FigureÂ  2c).  On the contrary, the morphology of the degraded S-1 and S-2  films exhibited a negligible change, as shown in FigureÂ 2d. To  illustrate that the change in film morphology originated from  illumination-related degradation and not from the process  of removing the HTL, we have shown the SEM image of the  un-illuminated film prepared at the same time that underwent  the same Au electrode and HTL removal process. We observed  approximately the same morphology in this un-illuminated  film as the fresh cast film.  \n\nA quick degradation in an initial burn-in stage for S-3 devices  with excess   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   would be caused by ion migration  since we  observed that this initial degradation is reversible (Figure S7,  Supporting Information). This is supported by a large hysteresis  in   $J{-}V$  curves of S-3 devices at lower scan rates,  while this  was not the case in S-1 and S-2 devices. However, the physical  origin of the increased hysteresis is still unclear at this stage.  Further, the degradation of S-3 devices after the burn-in stage  could be related to the decomposition of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   into metallic lead.  In fact, photolysis of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   has been reported by a number of  researchers, who have shown that   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   decomposes into metallic  lead when illumination energy is above the bandgap of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  at elevated temperature.  Recently, Qi group confirmed  photolysis of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   thin films by detecting the production of   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$  and   $\\mathrm{I}_{2}$   gas under light illumination of 0.55 sun. Mono and diiodine gas were detected by mass spectrometry. Newly formed   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   in films was confirmed by the emergence of an XRD peak  at   ${\\approx}31^{\\circ}$  , which was assigned to cubic   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$  . Additionally, X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further confirm   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$  , peaks of which were observed at 137.0 and   $141.9\\;\\mathrm{eV}.^{[29]}$   We  conducted XPS measurements on the degraded and un-illuminated S-3 films but did not observe XPS peaks coming from   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   on these film surfaces (Figure S9, Supporting Information).  \n\nWe supposed that   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   is mainly formed near the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2,}$  /perovskite interface, as we discuss next.  \n\nWe observed a gray colored film formed on the bottom  of the S-3 devices after   $520\\textrm{h}$   of illumination although there  was no gray colored film in the degraded S-1 and S-2 PSCs  (Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information). Additionally,  the gray colored film was only formed in the light exposed  area of the S-3 devices (Figures S11â€“S13, Supporting Information). These results indicate that the color change might  stem from the decomposition of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals in the perovskite  films of the S-3 device, and is related to the device degradation. Therefore, to confirm the photolysis of unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  ,  we measured XRD patterns of degraded and un-illuminated  PSCs after removing the perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD, and  Au layers. Note that the gray colored film was present on  the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   substrate as shown in Figure S14a,b (Supporting  Information) even after aggressive washing with dimethylformamide (DMF). XRD patterns in the area of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  films with gray color (degraded S-3) and without gray color  (un-illuminated S-3) are shown in  Figure Â  3 a,b. The XRD peaks  coming from poly crystalline   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   were seen in both unilluminated and degraded S-3 samples  (FigureÂ  3a). A new  peak at  ${\\approx}31^{\\circ}$   appeared in degraded S-3 samples (see enlarged  figure in FigureÂ 3c), which was assigned to cubic Pb.  Furthermore, after exposure of the gray colored film to   $\\mathrm{I}_{2}$   gas, it  changed to yellow color, consistent with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}{}^{[29]}$   as shown in  Figure S14c (Supporting Information). SEM-Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on the degraded and  un-illuminated areas of the same sample to confirm a change  in   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   content. The atomic percentage of   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   was   $1.28\\%$   in the  degraded area, which was about twice higher than that in the  un-illuminated area   $(0.54\\%)$   (see Table   $S2~\\mathrm{in}$   the Supporting  Information). This increased percentage of Pb likely originated  from the decomposition of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals. Therefore, these  results support that photolysis of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals in perovskite  films happened according to Equation (1)  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{s})+\\mathrm{I}_{2}\\left(\\mathrm{g}\\right)\n$$  \n\nWe carried out a photolysis experiment on   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  thin films  to confirm the mechanism represented with EquationÂ (1), and  observed that the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   photolysis happened under illumination  (Figure S15, Supporting Information), which is consistent with  literature.  \n\nWe further checked the influence of unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals  on operational stability of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   based PSCs.  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   devices  with unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals exhibited more rapid degradation  than those without unreacted  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals (Figures S16 and S17  and Table S3, Supporting Information). This is consistent with  the behavior of our CsFAMA-based PSCs discussed earlier.  Liu etÂ al. studied the effect of excess   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   on the photo stability  of   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   perovskite films and found that excess   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   has a  detrimental effect on the neat perovskite film stability as a result  of XRD analysis. However, no obvious difference in the overall  device degradation was observed.  Here, we confirmed that  unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   is also detrimental to the long-term operational  stability of PSCs with both the sophisticated CsFAMA-based  perovskite system and the classic   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   system because of  the formation of metallic Pb by the photolysis of   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   crystals  under continuous illumination.
