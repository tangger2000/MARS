Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The  crystal lin it y characterization of the   $\\mathsf{C s C u}_{2}\\vert_{3}\\textcircled{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\vert_{5}$   composites was  analyzed by XRD (P analytical X’ Pert Pro). The PL spectra were monitored  using a spec tro flu oro meter (Horiba; Fluorolog-3), and the transient PL  measurement was performed using a pulsed Nano-LED. The absorption  spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer.  The absolute PLQY of the   $\\mathsf{C s C u}_{2}\\vert_{3}\\textcircled{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\vert_{5}$   composites were  measured by using a fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba; FluoroMax-4)  with an integrated sphere (Horiba; Quanta $\\varphi)$  . Temperature-dependent  PL test was conducted using a closed-cycle helium cryostat system. The  EL spectra and current density–voltage–luminance curves of devices  were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter coupled with a Photo  Research Spectra Scan spectrophotometer PR705. The EQE was tested  by a photodetector (THORLABS, S120VC) and a digital optical power  meter (THORLABS, PM100D). The surface temperature of devices  during operation was monitored by an infrared camera (Fortric 220s).  \n\nFirst-Principles Calculations : All first-principles calculations were  performed by utilizing the plane-wave pseudo potential approach within  the framework of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in  the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The   $5s^{2}5\\mathsf{p}^{6}6s$   for Cs,   $3{\\mathsf{d}}^{10}4s$   for Cu,   $5\\mathsf{s}^{2}5\\mathsf{p}^{5}$   for I were treated explicitly as valence electrons  and the interactions between them and nucleus were described by the  projected augmented wave method. The electronic wave-functions  were expanded in plave-wave basis sets with kinetic energy of 400  eV  and the Brillouin zone   $k$  -point meshes with   $2\\pi\\times0.02~\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{-1}$   density was  used to ensure the energy convergence. The structures of   $\\mathsf{C s C u}_{2}|_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{5}$   were fully relaxed until the residual force on each atom being  less than   $0.01\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}\\,\\mathrm{\\AA^{-1}}$  . The hybrid PBE0 functional with   $25\\%$   nonlocal  Fock exchange was used to remedy the bandgap under estimation issue  and the wavefunction over delocalization problem of DFT for the STE  calculations. In the STE calculations, the structural distortions involve   $\\mathsf{C u-C u}$   bonds on equatorial plane being shortened and two   ${\\mathsf{C}}{\\mathsf{u}}{-}{\\mathsf{I}}$   bonds  in the axial direction being enlarged as shown in Figure S1, Supporting  Information. Following the Franck–Condon principle, the exciton  excitation and emission energies were obtained by calculating the total  energy differences between the excited and the ground states using  PBE0-optimized excited-state and ground-state structures, respectively.  A spin-singlet exciton and spin-triplet exciton were considered for  calculating the excitation energy and the emission energy, respectively.  The binding energy of STE was calculated by the equation:   $E_{\\flat}=E(\\mathsf{G S})\\ +$     $E_{\\mathrm{g}}-E$  (exciton), where  E (GS) and  E (exciton) are the total energies of the  ground state and the STE state, respectively, and  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   is the bandgap.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation  of China (Nos. 11774318, 61935009, 61722403, and 11674121), the Key  Scientific Research Projects of Higher Education in Henan Province  (18A140007), the Support Program for Scientific and Technological  Innovation  Talents  of  Higher  Education  in  Henan  Province  (19 HAST IT 017), and Jilin Province Science and Technology Development  Program (20190201016 JC).
