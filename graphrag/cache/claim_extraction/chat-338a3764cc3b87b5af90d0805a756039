Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Thus, the QD films with flat features  remained intact, a highly desirable property when constructing  high-performance op to electronic devices.  \n\nFigure   3  presents the evolution of the emissive properties  of QD films before and after incorporation of   $\\mathrm{MBr}_{x}$   through  the above OIHL strategy. Both films emit strong green light  as shown in Figure 3a, left. The emissive performance was  measured by steady-state PL spectra under the same condition.  The intensity of OIHL-passivated QD films shows higher than  that of the primal one. The high PL intensity indicates a large  number of electron − hole pair recombination, indicating that  more excitons are generated in the OIHL-passivated QD films.  \n\nFurthermore, the PLQYs of fresh QD films before and after  incorporation of   $Z n B r_{2}$   were   $58\\%$   and   $79\\%$  , respectively, qualified by the absolute PLQY measurements (Figure 3b). Interestingly, the PLQY of OIHL-passivated QD films was clearly  improved. The improved luminescent properties strongly  suggest that the incorporation of inorganic   $Z n B r_{2}$   could  reduce the surface defects of the QDs and increase the radiative recombination. Usually, a facile thermal treatment process  (e.g.,   ${\\approx}90\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ) is necessary for obtaining high-performance QDbased op to electronic devices. But, for perovskite QDs, such  thermal annealing could obviously decrease the PL properties resulting from an increase of non radiative recombination  centers, perhaps, due to the loss of organic ligands on the surface  of QDs.  The PLQY of primal QD films decreased to   $47\\%$   with  a reduction of   $20\\%$   after treated at   $90~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $5~\\mathrm{min}$  . While, for  OIHL-passivated QD films treated at  $90~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $5\\;\\mathrm{min}$  , the PLQY  could retain a nearly   $97\\%$  of the original value. Figure 3c shows  the results of heating and cooling steps for QD films normalized  to the original PL intensity at   $30~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . The emissive properties of  OIHL-passivated samples also exhibit excellent r ever sibi lit y after  thermal stress, consistently recovering the PLQY. In the case of  primal QD films, most of the PL is lost during the heating process, and only   $78\\%$   of the initial PL is recovered after cooling  down to room temperature. Thus, the incorporation of inorganic   $\\mathrm{MBr}_{x}$  is successful in terms of reducing the formation of the  non radiative recombination centers and elevating the thermal  stability of colloidal perovskite QD films consistent with the  results of the inorganic pass iv ation in traditional QDs.  \n\nExciton dynamics were analyzed using the PL delay to  demonstrate enhanced emissive features (Figure 3d; Table S1,  Supporting Information). The OIHL-passivated QD films  showed a longer PL lifetime with an average lifetime of  $'{\\approx}18.7$   ns  compared to that of   ${\\approx}10.8$   ns for primal QD films, which indicated that the relaxation of photo excited excitons in primal QD  films is faster than that in OIHL-passivated QD films. The  faster relaxation demonstrated that the primal QD films had  the larger densities of surface traps, and these surface traps provide local sites for fast relaxation of the photo excited excitons.  These surface trap ordinarily serves as a centre for nonradiative decay, and is proportional to the fraction of excited states  that do not luminesce.  Thus, the PL lifetime enhancement  reveals an overall reduction in non radiative recombination  within QD films, giving strong evidence of a reduced number  of charge traps after OIHL pass iv ation.  \n\nTransient absorption (TA) is conducted to further examine  the interplay between free carriers and excitons. TA experimental results are presented in Figure 3e and in Figure S5  (Supporting Information). All spectra show an identical sharp  negative signal at around   $520~\\mathrm{nm}$  , corresponding to the energy  band structure, which is resulted from the excited state filling  in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   with blocking the electron transition from the  valence band to conduction band.  The bleaching intensity of  OIHL-passivated QDs was much larger than that of QDs under  the same experimental conditions. The larger intensity in the  photo bleaching signal indicates that excitons more easily  transited to valence band in OIHL-passivated QD films, which  are less likely to be trapped by surface defects. The stronger TA  signal demonstrated the QD films had an enhanced quantity  through OIHL pass iv ation process.  Furthermore, Figure 3f  compares the transition dynamics   $(520\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   of the QDs and  OIHL-passivated QDs measured with a pump light intensity  of   $5~\\upmu\\mathrm{J~cm}^{-2}$  . In general, the decay time of the photo bleaching  peak in QD films was strongly dependent on the rate of trap  assist excited states’ quenching. The kinetic recombination  exhibited a slower delay after the QDs were passivated by the  OIHL process, indicating that excitons are more mobile and  have more efficient charge separation. In other words, the  longer exciton lifetime indicates a lower density of surface trap  states within the bandgap after being passivated by OIHLs.   Thus, a direct comparison clearly shows that the non radiative  recombination was suppressed in OIHL-passivated QDs compared to primal QDs.  \n\nThe enhanced emissive properties of QDs through the OIHL  strategy are presented in Figure 3g. The primal QDs exhibit  a certain amount of surface defect sites in the process of film  formation due to the loss of capping ligands on the surface of  QDs. These surface defect sites, as non radiative recombination  centers, do not luminesce. Accordingly, the radiative recombination for emissive properties becomes weaken. After QDs  were passivated by OIHLs, the surface defect sites are effectively  decreased and the non radiative recombination process is hindered.  Resultant ly, they displayed a higher PL feature. Thus,  the QDs passivated by the incorporation of inorganic ligands  with more radiative recombination were deemed favorable for  enhancing the recombination efficiency of electrons and holes  in constructing EL devices.  \n\nAs described above, the inorganic pass iv ation process could  enhance the electrical properties of QD films.
