{"result": "## COMPLETE", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

Compared with   $\\mathrm{p{\\cdot}T i_{3}C_{2}T_{x}},$  the peaks related to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  are shifted to lower binding energy, indicating the increase  of electron density around   $\\mathrm{Ti}$   atoms via charge transfer from  TBAB to   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  .  Compared with   $\\mathrm{p{\\cdot}T i_{3}C_{2}T_{x}},$   TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  shows a novel peak at   $532.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   of –ON, which is derived from  the electrostatic interaction between   $_\\mathrm{N}$   atoms of TBAB and  surface O-terminals of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   (Figure  2b).  As shown in  Figure  2c, TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   shows extra N 1s peak from TBAB.  The N 1s peak with core level at   $401.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   is corresponding to  the adsorbed   $_\\mathrm{N}$   atoms, further evidencing the attachment of  TBAB on  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   surface, and the N 1s peak at   $399.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   should  be derived from the  $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$   bond of TBAB.  In addition, TBAB-\n $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   also shows extra   $\\operatorname{Br}\\,3\\mathrm{d}$   peak from TBAB compared to \n\n  $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   (Figure 2d), indicating the presence of Bromine ion \n\n  $\\left(\\mathrm{Br}^{-}\\right)$   in TBAB-  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  . UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is used to measure the  WF of   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   and TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   films ( Figure   3 a). The WF  of   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   is   $4.5\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  , similar to that reported value in the literature.  TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   shows a significantly reduced WF of   $3.9\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  , which may be originated from charge transfer and/or  interface dipole between TBAB and  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  . Figure 3b displays  electron para magnetic resonance (EPR) results of   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  and TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   in solid state. No EPR signal is detected for   $\\mathrm{p{\\cdot}T i_{3}C_{2}T_{x}},$   while TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  shows strong EPR signal, demonstrating efficient electron transfer from TBAB to  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  . The  electron transfer from TBAB to   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   can decrease the WF  of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   and increase electrical conductivity of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  . Density functional theory (DFT) calculation is performed to investigate the effects of the TBAB attachment on the WF of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  The   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   is   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}$   MXene terminated by   $\\mathrm{T_{x}}$  groups, and the  compositions of the   $\\mathrm{T_{x}}$  groups are reasonably assumed to be   $81.25\\%$   of oxygen,   $12.5\\%$   of hydroxyl, and   $6.25\\%$   of fluorine  in the DFT calculation.

The calculated WF  values of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   are 4.40 and   $4.71~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively,  similar with the previous report.

Figure 3c depicts the Bader charge transfer  from TBAB molecule to   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}},$   where the partial charge  of TBAB is transferred from the N atom to the Br atom and  then to the surface of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  .
