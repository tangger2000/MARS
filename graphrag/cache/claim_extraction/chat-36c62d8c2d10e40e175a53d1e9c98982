specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.

For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized.

TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Based on these advantages, MHPs have recently shown unprecedented radical progress (maximum current efficiency from 0.3 to  ${\\bf42.9\\c d\\,A^{-1}})$  ) in the field  of light-emitting diodes. However, perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs)  suffer from intrinsic instability of MHP materials and instability arising from  the operation of the PeLEDs. Recently, many researchers have devoted efforts  to overcome these instabilities. Here, the origins of the instability in PeLEDs  are reviewed by categorizing it into two types: instability of (i) the MHP materials and (ii) the constituent layers and interfaces in PeLED devices. Then, the  strategies to improve the stability of MHP materials and PeLEDs are critically  reviewed, such as A-site cation engineering, Ruddlesden–Popper phase, suppression of ion migration with additives and blocking layers, fabrication of  uniform bulk poly crystalline MHP layers, and fabrication of stable MHP nanoparticles. Based on this review of recent advances, future research directions  and an outlook of PeLEDs for display applications are suggested.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nstitution of constituents, and applicability of diverse solution  processes at low temperature   $(<\\!100\\ ^{\\circ}{\\mathrm{C}})$   expand the potential  of MHP emitters for applications in large-area displays. Particularly, a remarkably wide color gamut arising from the  narrow emission linewidth of MHPs   $\\mathrm{\\{FWHM<20\\nm\\}}$  ) compared with those of organic emitters   $(\\mathrm{FWHM}\\approx40~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) and  inorganic quantum dot (QD) emitters   $(\\mathrm{FWHM}\\approx30~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) is a  distinct advantage of MHPs as alternative light emitters for  vivid natural-color displays.  \n\nMetal halide per ovsk ites (MHPs) have stimulated intense  research in the field of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and  researchers have achieved significant breakthroughs in the  electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of MHP LEDs (PeLEDs)  in only three years  $[1{-}5]$   MHPs are semiconducting materials  that have an   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   perovskite crystal structure where A is  an organic cation (e.g., methyl ammonium (MA)   ${\\mathrm{CH}}_{3}{\\mathrm{NH}}_{3}{}^{+}$  ,  \n\nResearch on PeLEDs that can exhibit bright EL at room  temperature began in 2014.  The EL efficiency was  moderate (maximum current efficiency   $\\mathrm{CE}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\;=\\;0.3^{[14]}$   and  0.577 cd   $\\mathsf{A}^{-1[15]}$  ), but these pioneering studies were enough to  arouse intense interest among many researchers in the field  of op to electronics. In fact, early PeLEDs based on MHP emission layers were reported before 2014, but they showed bright  EL only at cryogenic temperatures  or emitted from fluorescent organic dyes (leading to a broad EL with  $\\mathrm{FWHM}\\approx90\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  ),  not from corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{6}$   octahedra.  EL of PeLEDs that  was barely detectable by the naked eye at room temperature  was reported in 2011, but device efficiency could not be quantified because the brightness was too low.  The EL of PeLEDs  at room temperature is limited due to: (i) thermal dissociation  of excitons, (ii) slow bimolecular recombination caused by from  spin–orbit coupling (Rashba effect) and anisotropy of organic  A-site cations,  and (iii) the lack of optimal device structures  for efficient charge-carrier injection and balanced transport of  injected charge carriers. The thermal dissociation of generated  excitons suppresses geminate radiative recombination and thus  limits the luminescence efficiency. Also, large energy barriers  between MHP emission layers and charge-injection/transport  layers can reduce the efficiency of charge injection,  and  charge unbalance in the emission layers can retard radiative  recombination.  \n\nThe academic and technological background for fabricating  efficient and bright PeLEDs has been established, along with  developments of organic LEDs (OLEDs), QD LEDs, and MHP  solar cells (PeSCs) over decades. The great progress in OLEDs  and QD LEDs has provided effective strategies to construct  efficient light-emitting devices and has yielded in depth understanding of the excited-state properties of light emitters.   Furthermore, recent intensive research on PeSCs has provided  understanding of the electronic and structural properties  of MHPs, and effective methods to control the morphology of  MHP poly crystalline films.  Developments in these fields  have revitalized studies of PeLEDs and significantly increased  the EL efficiency and brightness.  \n\nThe recent rapid progress in EL efficiency of PeLEDs  has been unprecedented; the record EL efficiency of visible  PeLEDs steeply increased from   $\\mathrm{{CE}_{\\mathrm{{max}}}\\;=\\;0.3}$   to 42.9 cd   $\\mathsf{A}^{-1}$     (from maximum external quantum efficiency   $\\mathrm{EQE}_{\\mathrm{max}}=0.1\\%$    to   $8.53\\%$  ) within one and a half years.  The EL efficiency of  near-infrared PeLEDs also greatly increased from the initial  efficiency (from   $\\mathrm{EQE}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\,=\\,0.1\\%^{[14]}$  to   $10.4\\%^{[4]}$  \nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
