Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The high thermal stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   may improve the operational stability of PeLEDs,  possibly by suppressing degradation caused by thermal  stresses including Joule heating. Durable   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PeLEDs  have been produced, in which the luminance continuously  increased from   $L_{0}\\approx100$   cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   to   $L_{0}>400$   cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   for   ${\\tt>}15\\mathrm{~h~}$    of operation time (applied current density of   $66.67~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ),  whereas   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   PeLEDs exhibited much poorer stability   $(L_{50}=255\\ \\mathrm{s})$  ).  Also,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PeLEDs with operational lifetime   $(L_{50}\\,\\approx\\,450\\,\\,\\mathrm{min})$  ) higher than that of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   PeLEDs \n\n  $(L_{50}~\\approx~300~\\mathrm{\\min})$   have been reported.  PeLEDs based on \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NPs with a device structure of   $\\mathrm{Au}/\\mathrm{p}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MgNiO}/\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}$   \n\n  $\\mathrm{NPs/n\\mathrm{-}M g Z n O/n^{+}{\\cdot}G a N}$   also had relatively long operational  lifetime of   $L_{80}\\approx9\\mathrm{~h~}$  .

This difference indicates  that high thermal stability does not always guarantee high operational stability of PeLEDs; the reason is that the main degradation mechanism in PeLEDs is related more to ion migration  than to thermal degradation.  \n\nSystems with mixed A-site cations have been investigated  to overcome the limitations of systems with single A-site cations   $(\\mathrm{MAPbX}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FAPbX}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  ) such as spontaneous  transformation to non per ovsk it e phase and material degradation by heat, light incidence, and air exposure.

Mixed-cation systems have  many advantages for PeLEDs, such as reduced trap density,  increased charge-carrier mobility,  and increased  PLQE  compared to those of single-cation systems.  \n\nAlthough material stability has been improved by introducing  mixed-cation systems, the operational stability of PeLEDs  has not been strikingly improved. Green, blue, and infrared  PeLEDs based on triple A-site cations   $\\mathrm{(Cs^{+},\\,M A^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  ) have  been fabricated;  the luminance of the green triple-cation  PeLED increased over time from 736.7 to 1335.7  cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  for   $135~\\mathrm{\\min}$  , then decreased to   $800.7~\\mathrm{~cd~}\\mathrm{~m~}^{-2}$   at   $475~\\mathrm{\\min}$  (Figure 9B), but the operational st abilities of blue and infrared  triple-cation PeLEDs were much inferior to that of green triplecation PeLEDs (Figure 9B,C).  Other groups have reported  mixed-cation PeLEDs, but they had very short operational lifetimes   $(L_{50}\\approx80$   s,  160 s,  and   ${>}1\\ \\mathrm{h}^{[130]}$  ) despite high EL  efficiency   $(33.9\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{A}^{-1})$  ).  \n\n# 3.2. Ruddlesden–Popper Phase  \n\nTo improve the stability of the crystal structure of MHPs,  the formation of an RP phase can be a good strategy. To  form an RP phase, large OA groups should be added to 3D  perovskite structure. The large OA inter ca late s between the  3D perovskite structures to form an RP multi layered structure (quasi-2D structure). The multi layered structure can be  characterized by  the number  m  of   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{6}$   octahedral planes, \n\n  $(m~=~1$   for 2D structure and   $m~=~\\infty$   for 3D structure) \n\n ( Figure   10 A).  \n\nRP MHPs have the potential to increase the EL efficiency in  PeLEDs, because the exciton binding energy of RP MHPs can  be significantly increased by exciton confinement. In RP MHPs  that show 2D exciton behaviors, the exciton binding energy can  increase to  $\\mathrm{>}300~\\mathrm{meV},^{[174-177]}$   which is much higher than that  of 3D counterparts   $(40{-}150~\\mathrm{meV}$   for MAPbBr;   $13{-}50~\\mathrm{meV}$   for   $\\mathrm{\\small{MA}P b I_{3}})$  ).  Assuming that all absorbed photons generate  electron–hole pairs, the PLQE   $\\eta$  can be determined by three  different recombination rates: trap-assisted mono molecular  recombination rate   $k_{1}$   (excitonic recombination rate for RP  MHPs), bimolecular recombination rate   $k_{2\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
