Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

After P3HT coating,  the electron distribution becomes delocalized, suggesting  the localized states are passivated. In addition, the   $C s{-}S$   and   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{S}$   bonds at the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br/P3HT}}$   interface can be detected  by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements  (Figure S5, Supporting Information), confirming the results  of calculations. In short, the introduction of P3HT results in a  lower density of inter facial trap states, as well as strong binding  between P3HT and per ovsk ites.  \n\nFast hole transfer from   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   to P3HT happens after  the film is annealed at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . The PL lifetimes of annealed   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br/P3HT}}$   films are shortened to   $0.89\\;\\mathrm{ns}$  , which is much  shorter than that of 1.85 ns for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}/$  spiro-OMeTAD  films (Figure 3b, Table S2, Supporting Information). The CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   crystal size within the bilayer remained unchanged after  annealing (Figure S6, Supporting Information), indicating  the decreased PL lifetime is not related to the change of grain  size. In order to further investigate the hole transfer process,  we studied the spectra distribution of photo excited carriers in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br/P3HT}}$   films using femtosecond broadband TA spectroscopy. The TA 2D color maps of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}/\\mathrm{P3HT}$   films  before and after annealing are presented in  Figure   4 a,b. No  redshift of the transient bleach peak is observed, indicating  a flat energy landscape and negligible tail states below the  bandgap.  This suggests that the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films are promising for solar cells with minimized   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$  . On the other hand,  the decay dynamics are much faster for the annealed bilayer  films (Figure 4c), which is consistent with the TRPL results  in Figure 3b. Half-lifetime for the annealed   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br/P3HT}}$  film decreases from over 1300 to  ${\\approx}400$   ps, indicating annealed  P3HT has efficient hole extraction in photovoltaic devices due  to the good band alignments and strong interaction between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and P3HT.  \n\nEnergy disorder mitigation in charge transport layers has  been demonstrated as a powerful method to reduce the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   of  perovskite solar cells.  The annealing process is supposed to  mitigate the energy disorder by reducing P3HT structural disorder.  The increased crystal lin it y of P3HT can be seen clearly  in the XRD results shown in Figure 4d. The XRD patterns are  obtained from a drop-cast P3HT film on top of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    Increased intensity and narrowed peak width are observed in  the Bragg peak at   ${\\approx}5^{\\circ}$  , demonstrating improved crystal lin it y  and indicating that a larger polymer crystal size is achieved.   Annealing may also influence the interface between the P3HT  and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}.$  . As shown in the inset of Figure 4d, the P3HT  becomes soft during the annealing process, which effectively  increases the contact area, thus the hole transfer paths. Overall,  the annealing process promotes interface properties with  lower inter facial energy disorder together with enhanced hole  transfer from   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   to P3HT, which are in good agreement  with improved photovoltaic performance, especially improved   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   with reduced   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   (Figure S7, Table S3, Supporting  Information).  \n\nFigure   5 a shows the schematics of the device structure and  Figure 5b shows cross-sectional SEM image of the device.
