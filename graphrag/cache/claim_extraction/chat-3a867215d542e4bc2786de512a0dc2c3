For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Remarkably, fluence dependence measurements suggested a scaling of the photo luminescence with the  fourth power of the excitation density at room temperature, in  contrast to a quadratic behavior at cryogenic temperatures. This  was attributed to a transition from exciton gas to free charge  carriers with an increasing temperature. A similar temperaturedependent fluorescence has been observed from a formamidinium (FA) lead halide perovskite   $\\mathrm{FAPbBr}_{3}$   nano crystal.  \n\nExcept for the 3D per ovsk ites such as   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$  and   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  , 2D per ovsk ites  including   $\\mathrm{(PEA_{2}P b I_{4})}$  (PEA  $=$  phenyl ethyl amine) flake-like crystals have also demonstrated a giant 2PA coefficient   $(211.5~\\mathrm{cm}~\\mathrm{MW}^{-1})$   and exhibited  a saturation effect (saturation intensity:   $0.22~\\mathrm{GW}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ) under  excitation of   $800\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   fs laser light.  Dielectric microspheres  of these 2D perovskite flakes can not only concentrate the  pumping laser but also effectively increase the detection efficiency of the emitted two-photon-excited fluorescence (2PF)  signals. The internal quantum efficiency of the 2D perovskite  was also increased in the hybrid dielectric structure due to a  reduced non radiative rate, which increased the 2PF emission  by two orders of magnitude in the hybrid dielectric structure. Moreover, the hybrid dielectric structure was proven to  be useful for 2PF-based super-resolution imaging at a relatively low excitation power of   $0.05\\mathrm{\\mW.}^{176}$   This 2PF emission  of the 2D   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$   perovskite could be employed for energy  transfer by forming perovskite he t ero structures with   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  .  Under two-photon excitation, the photo luminescence of the   $(\\mathrm{PEA})_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$   flake was nearly completely quenched, while that of  the   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   microplate is greatly increased (6.5 times higher)  \n\nin the he t ero structure. The radiative energy transfer occurs on  an ultrafast timescale with a high efficiency   $(\\approx\\!100\\%)$  .  \n\n2D Ruddlesden–Popper per ovsk ites, also known as quasi2D per ovsk ites, feature strongly bound electron–hole pairs  (excitons) for highly efficient light-emitting diodes in the linear  optical regime.  Recently, Jang and co-workers showed that  the third-order optical non linearity,   $n_{2}$  , of hybrid lead iodide  per ovsk ites was greatly enhanced in the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper  series,   $(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}(\\mathrm{CH}_{2})_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3})_{2}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3})_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}\\mathrm{I}_{3n+1}$     $(n=1–4)$  .  They  engineered the bandgap of these per ovsk ites from   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}=1.60$   to   $2.40~\\mathrm{eV}$   by tuning from  $n=1$   (2D) to   $n=\\infty$   (bulk) and observed  a quantum confinement causing four times stronger third harmonic generation (THG) at the mid-infrared from these 2D  per ovsk ites as compared with the 3D counterpart   $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\right)$   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{3}$  . Loh and co-workers mechanically exfoliated 2D perovskite nanosheets from four different 2D Ruddlesden–Popper  per ovsk ites   $\\mathrm{(C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3})_{2}P b B r_{4}}$     $(n=1)$  ),   $(\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3}})_{2}\\mathrm{PbI_{4}}$     $(n=1)$  ), \n\n  $(\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3}})_{2}(\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}})\\mathrm{Pb_{2}I_{7}}$     $(n=2)$  , and   $(\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3}})_{2}(\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}})$   $\\mathrm{Pb}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{7}$     $(n=3)$  ), and observed ultra strong THG with a maximum  effective third-order susceptibility,   $\\chi^{(3)}$  , of   $1.12\\times10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-2}$  . The THG emission is resonantly enhanced at the excitonic  bandgap energy of the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite crystals and can be tuned from UV to red by selecting the homologue with the requisite resonance.  \n\nOther than third-order NLO effects such as 2PA and THG,  Jang and co-workers characterized the higher-order nonlinear  optical three-photon absorption (3PA) of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbCl}_{3}$   single  crystals, with a 3PA coefficient   $\\gamma$  of   $0.05\\pm0.01\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\;\\mathrm{GW}^{-2}$   under  excitation of  $1064\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and a strong anisotropy depending on the  polarization of the excitation beam.  Similar 3PA excited fluorescence has been observed from single crystals of bromined  and iodined per ovsk ites   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Br}_{x}\\mathrm{I}_{1-x})_{3}$  .  Remarkably, Sum and co-workers demonstrated highly efficient fivephoton-excited up conversion fluorescence from a family of  colloidal halide perovskite   $\\mathrm{(CsPbBr}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  , and core–shell   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbBr_{3}/(O A)_{2}P b B r_{4}}$   nano crystals.  By a combination of  Z-scan and multi photon-excited photo luminescence methods,  they determined the five-photon absorption cross sections to be   $\\eta\\delta_{5}\\approx10^{-136}~\\mathrm{{cm}^{10}~\\mathrm{{s}^{4}}}$   photon − 4 , about nine orders of magnitude  larger than the state-of-the-art designed NLO organic molecules. The effective two- and multiple-photon absorption and the  fluorescence of microsized single crystals of organic/inorganic  halide per ovsk ites have been employed for up conversion lasing  devices. When linear optically pumped lasing effects have been  frequently demonstrated from various hybrid perovskite microcrystals with different morph o logie s,  two-photon pumped   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   micro lasers from Fabry–Perot cavity modes of  microwires  and whispering-gallery-modes of microplates have also been experimentally demonstrated ( Figure    3 ). The  quality   $(\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{Q}})$   factors of these micro lasers are highly dependent  on the different optical modes. For the two-photon pumped   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   microwire lasers, the   $Q$   factor was   ${\\approx}682$   and  the lasing threshold was   ${\\approx}220\\ensuremath{~\\mathrm{~n~}}$  J   $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,  while those for the  microplates were   ${>}2000$   and   ${\\approx}3.3\\ \\mathrm{m}$  J   $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively.
