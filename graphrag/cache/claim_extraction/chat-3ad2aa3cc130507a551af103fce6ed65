Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Therefore, it is very important to control  the radii of the constituent ions to make a stable cubic perovskite structure. Considering the effective radii of halogen  anions (  $\\cdot\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$  : 167 pm;   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$  : 182 pm; I − : 206 pm),   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   have cubic structure and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   has tetragonal  structure at room temperature.  Due to the unstable  tetragonal structure of   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   PeSCs exhibit signi­ ficant degradation at relative humidity (RH)  $\\geq55\\%$  , whereas  MAPb  $(\\mathrm{Br}_{x}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{I}_{1-x}})_{3}$   PeSCs retained their initial power conversion  efficiency (PCE) for   $20\\,\\mathrm{~d~}$   (at room temperature,   $\\mathrm{RH}\\,=\\,55\\%$  for a day and  $35\\%$   for the rest of days, without encapsulation)  when   $x\\ge0.2$   (cubic structure).  \n\n# 2.1.2. Influence of Temperature on Stability  \n\nThe MHP emission layer in PeLEDs must be thermally stable,  because it may experience high temperatures during fabrication and device operation (Joule heating),  and because  PeLEDs may be used outdoors.  \n\nThe most frequently used A-site cation in MHPs is the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation. Representative ly,   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   have  been used as emission layers to fabricate high-efficiency  green  and infrared  PeLEDs, respectively. However, under thermal stress,   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$   can suffer from severe  degradation by the following decomposition pathways (P1)  and (P2)  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}P b X_{3}\\left(s\\right)\\rightarrow P b X_{2}\\left(s\\right)\\mathrm{+\\,CH_{3}N H_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\mathrm{+\\,H X\\left(g\\right)}}}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}P b X_{3}\\left(s\\right)\\rightarrow P b X_{2}\\left(s\\right)+\\ C H_{3}X\\left(g\\right)+\\ N H_{3}\\left(g\\right)}\n$$  \n\nThe decomposition pathway of   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$   is still under debate  because the decomposition products from both pathways  have been experimentally measured.  A recent study on  thermal decomposition of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   showed that both of the  decomposition pathways are possible and also depend on  temperature.  Pathway (P2), which is thermodynamic ally  favored over pathway (P1), becomes favorable as temperature  increases because kinetic hindrance of pathway (P2) is mitigated  at high temperatures.  \n\nThermo grav i metric analysis measures weight loss of MHPs  as temperature is increased; the onset of weight loss indicates vol at i liz ation of breakdown products, and is therefore a  measure of the stability of the compound.  MABr begins to  decompose at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ,  and   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$   begins to decompose at   $200–300\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$     $(\\approx\\!220\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  ,    ${\\approx}200\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ,    ${\\approx}250\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , and   ${\\approx}294\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C}^{[53]}$  for   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}.$  ). The decomposition onset  temperature of  $200–300\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   may be regarded as thermally stable,  but many researchers have reported that thermal degradation  can occur at temperatures   ${<\\!200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}}$  .  The optimal annealing  temperature to give the best PCE of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   PeSCs is  $\\approx\\!100\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ;  further increase in this temperature degrades device efficiency  by damaging the MHP layers, as proven by the occurrence of \n\n  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peaks at temperatures   ${>}120~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in the X-ray diffraction \n\n (XRD) patterns.  Also, the intensity of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peak in XRD patterns of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   films is significantly increased by thermal  annealing at   $140~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\\mathrm{min}$  , whereas the increase is negligible at   $100\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.^{[60]}$   The thermal degradation of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   layers  can be clearly visualized by conductive atomic force microscopy  (c-AFM) measurement ( Figure   2 ).  Even in a nitrogen atmosphere, the annealing of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   layers at   $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $24\\textrm{h}$   was  shown to cause a significant amount of current-less dark area  as a result of the degradation of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  .  These experiments clearly show that   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   is not thermally stable.  \n\n$\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   has a stable cubic crystal structure and higher   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{X}$   bond strength than   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  , and therefore has relatively better thermal stability than   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  .  Irradiation of  100 suns on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   films at elevated temperature of   $45–55\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  reduces its absorption, but   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   films were found to  be stable under the same conditions.  However,   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  also experiences slight thermal degradation even at   ${<}100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  .  Increasing the annealing time of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   emission layers  from 10 to   $30\\;\\mathrm{\\min}$   (at   $90~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  ) causes slight sublimation of  MABr and reduces crystal lin it y, and thereby decreases the EL  efficiency of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   PeLEDs.  \n\nThe thermal instability of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   can be  understood by calculating the enthalpy of formation from MAI  (or MABr) and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   (or   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  ).  The calculated enthalpies  of formation were   $34.50\\;\\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}}$   for  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $6.69\\;\\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}}$  for   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$  .  These positive enthalpies of formation indicate  that   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   are thermodynamic ally unstable.  A density functional theory (DFT) calculation also yielded the  formation enthalpies of   $\\mathrm\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
