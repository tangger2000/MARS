The trap density can be  determined by   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$  using the following equation   $n_{\\mathrm{trap}}=2\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}$   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}/e L^{2}$  .  The trap density is proportional to   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$  . The results  show that the trap density of film deposited on   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   is  lower than that of the film deposited on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . This is due to  low non radiative recombination and results in a higher   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  .

It is well known that  the high-frequency component represents the transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{tr}})$   and the low-frequency component indicates the  recombination resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{re}}\\right)$  . Small   $R_{\\mathrm{tr}}$   is beneficial to electron extraction, and large   $R_{\\mathrm{re}}$   means less charge recombination.  Figure 3f shows the Nyquist plots of cells with different  ETLs under dark conditions, and the equivalent circuit diagram  and specific parameters of devices based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   are shown in Figure S16 and Table S2 in the Supporting  Information, respectively. The   $R_{\\mathrm{re}}$   of devices based on   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   is significantly larger than that of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , meaning low  recombination rates and resulting in enhanced FF and   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  .  \n\nAn optimized device with a PCE of   $23.24\\%$   was successfully  fabricated ( Figure    4 a). Significantly, this device demonstrates  a high voltage of   $1.17\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   with only   $0.36\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   loss in potential.  This is one of the highest voltages demonstrated by an   $\\mathrm{n{-}i{-}p}$    planar structure (1.53 eV). Moreover, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -based device was measured  (Figure 4b). The integrated current density is   $24.34\\mathrm{~mA}\\mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$  ,  matching well with the values from   $J{-}V$  characterization. The  steady-state efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPP)  of the optimized PSC was also measured. The maximum voltage  for the devices with   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   is   $0.98~\\mathrm{V},$   and the maximum current  density is  $23.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The corresponding steady-state output  PCE was   $22.74\\%$   (Figure   $4\\mathrm{c}$  ). The best-performing device was  sent to a PV calibration laboratory (Quality supervision and  Testing Center of Chemical and Physical Power Sources of  Information Industry, China) for certification. A certified efficiency of   $22.54\\%$   was demonstrated with a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of 1.16 V,   $J_{S C}$    of   $24.78\\mathrm{{\\mA\\cm\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
