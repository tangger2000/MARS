Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The  long alkyl chains of PBMA and a relatively low oxygen diffusion  coefficient inhibited photo-oxidation of PQDs effectively.  \n\n# 4.4. Inorganic Polymers  \n\nInorganic polymers, such as diamond, silica, glass, ceramic and  boron oxide, are polymers composed of nonoxide and oxide  compounds with a skeletal structure, which does not include  carbon atoms in backbone. Usually, inorganic polymers are  stable and tight medium, which can enhance the resistance of  core materials against high temperature scaling and oxidation  effectively. Their much slower structural relaxation time can provide a barrier layer to slow down the diffusion of oxygen or polar  solvents. Here, we put two kinds of compounds as examples to  give some introduction for inorganic polymers for encapsulation.  \n\nCeramics such as silicon oxycarbide (SiCO), silicon carbide  (SiC), silicon nitride   $\\mathrm{(Si_{3}N_{4})}$  , or silicon carbon it ride (SiCN),  obtained by a polymer-derived step method, always show creep  resistance, thermal stability, high temperature strength, corrosion and oxidation stability as well as hardness.  By selecting  appropriate organo elemental compounds precursors such  as poly carbo si lanes (PCS), poly sila zane s (PSA), or poly silo x an es  (PSZ) and controlling the degree of cross linking, pyrolysis  temperature or pyrolysis atmosphere, the micro structure, and  composition and mechanical or chemical properties of ceramics  can be adjusted in a wide range.  These organo elemental compounds exactly show two opportune conditions for encapsulation. On the one hand, they can act as a capping ligand to  passivate the surface of PQDs. On the other hand, they have  remaining silazane moieties forming ceramic protective layers  with different   $\\mathrm{SiN}_{x},$  ,   $\\mathrm{SiN}_{x}\\mathrm{O}_{\\gamma},$   and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{\\gamma}$   ratios, which depends on  the degree of moisture-induced hydrolysis reaction by incomplete cross linking reaction between   $-\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{Si}{-}\\mathrm{N}{-}\\mathrm{H}{-}$   groups  and   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  . Yoon et  al. reported   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PSZ}$   composites  maintain a high PLQYs   $({\\approx}81.7\\%)$   compared with bare   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs   $({\\approx}90.4\\%)$  , and the maximum PL peak   $(522\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) show a  small redshift ( Figure    9 a,b). The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PSZ}$   composites  can maintain excellent environmental stability while stored at  about 60 day at open air with an improved thermal stability  while heated from 60 to   $140~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (the inset of Figure 9c), they  even exhibited stable PL intensity after more than   $70\\:\\mathrm{{h}}$   in polar  solvents.  Also, it was confirmed that efficiency of   $\\mathrm{PODS@}$  ceramics (poly sila zane, PSZ) were maintained at approximately   $90.2\\%$     $(60\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  ,   $52.1\\%$     $(100\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  , and   $33.7\\%$     $(140~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   compared to  initial efficiency in high-temperature stability test.  \n\nGenerally, glass refer these optical transparent noncrystalline amorphous solid compounds with a disordered atomic  structure, which show a better thermal conductivity character,  mechanical st abilities and more corrosion resistant to chemical  attack than other materials.  Amorphous   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   is the most  common fundamental constituent of glass. And some other  ingredients such as lead, barium, or lanthanum oxide can be  added to change the properties of glass. The more general  types of silicate glasses are fused quartz, soda-lime-silica glass,  sodium borosilicate glass, lead-oxide glass, a lumi no silicate  glass, boro-germanate glasses, and so on. Usually, there is a  need a kinetic ally frozen by rapid quenching process to form  glass. With a further cutting and polishing, the characteristics  of glass, such as transmission, reflection, and refraction parameters, are enhanced a lot.
