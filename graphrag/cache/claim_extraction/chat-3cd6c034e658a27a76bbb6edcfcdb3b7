Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

As shown in  Table S3 (Supporting Information), the average charge of Co  atoms in perfect   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$   structure is 7.6532. With replacing  one of the 16 octahedral Co atoms with Fe, the average charge  of Co drops to 7.6517 in   $\\mathrm{Zn_{V}F e{-}Z n C o_{2}O_{4}}$  . The Bader charge  and magnetic moment of Fe in   $\\mathrm{Zn_{V}F e{-}Z n C o_{2}O_{4}}$   are 6.27 and   $3.97~\\upmu\\mathrm{B}$  , respectively, signifying the very existence of   $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$  .  It  suggests that the electron hopping between Fe and Co is quite  unlikely because   $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$   can hardly be oxidized.  Alternatively,  there is greater tendency for electron-deficient   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   vacancies  to withdraw electron density away from Co, resulting in the  increase of Co valence state. Thus, the observed Co valence  states (slightly higher than   $+3$  ) in some   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$  oxides  (  $\\prime x=0.2$  , 0.4, and 0.6) is not surprising. From the DFT analysis,  the alteration of Co electronic state by Fe substitutions has been  illuminated and is consistent with the XANES result.  \n\nThe spinel   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$   oxides were then tested for their  electro catalytic OER performance (Figure S4, Supporting Information).  Figure   2 a shows the representative OER CV curve of \n\n  $\\mathrm{ZnFe_{0.4}C o_{1.6}O_{4}}$   recorded within a potential window of 1.0–1.7 V \n\n (vs RHE) in   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated   $0.1\\;\\mathrm{~M~}\\;\\mathrm{KOH}$   and the positive-going  OER curves after background and   $i R$  -correction.  As catalytic OER only involves the surface atoms, catalytic activity  based on catalysts’ surface area, instead of electrode geometric  area, reflects the intrinsic activity of a given catalyst.  Thus,  the background- and  iR -corrected OER kinetic currents are  normalized by the surface area of oxides to extract the specific  activity shown in Figure 2b. The surface areas of spinel oxides  were determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements (shown in Figure S5 and Table S4, Supporting Information), as extracting the specific activity of powder catalysts  by BET surface area is a well-established methodology.  As  shown in Figure 2b, the OER activities of   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$     $(x=$  0–2) oxides span across a potential window of   ${\\approx}130\\ensuremath{~\\mathrm{mV}$   and  the activity difference between   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$   and   $\\mathrm{ZnFe_{2}O_{4}}$   is   ${\\approx}2$  orders of magnitude. Consider   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$   as benchmark here,  Fe substitution may either cause a promotion on the OER or  a demotion, depending on the substitution amount. Potentials  required to drive a current density of   $25\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\mathrm{or}$   are mapped  out in Figure 2c. The OER activity is promoted by a relatively  small amount of Fe substitution   $(x=0.2–0.6)$  , as indicated by  the reduced over potentials (of  $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}_{\\approx35\\;\\mathrm{mV}}$   in maximum) compared  with that of   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$  . On the contrary, activity deterioration s  are detected with high Fe substitution amounts   $(x=1.0–2.0)$  .  The OER of commercial   $\\mathrm{{lrO}_{2}}$   was tested following a consistent  procedure described for the   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$   catalysts (details can  be found in the Supporting Information). The linear sweep  voltammetry (LSV) of the   $\\mathrm{{lrO}_{2}}$   is compared with that of the  best-performing   $\\mathrm{ZnFe_{0.4}C o_{1.6}O_{4}}$   in the inset of Figure 2d. It  clearly suggests that the   $\\mathrm{ZnFe_{0.4}C o_{1.6}O_{4}}$   is a promising candidate for replacing commercial   $\\mathrm{{lrO}_{2}}$  . The stability test (over  5000 cycles) run for the   $\\mathrm{ZnFe_{0.4}C o_{1.6}O_{4}}$   oxide (Figure 2d, and  Figure S6, Supporting Information) demonstrates that the  durability requirements are also met. The slight increase of current could be due to the leaching of   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   (small amount) and  \n\n$\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$   oxides. As the majority of Co  possesses a valence state of   ${\\approx}{+}3$   or a mixture  of   $+3/+4,$  , the molecular orbital diagrams  of   ${C o}^{3+}{-}{\\mathrm{OH}}$   and   ${C o}^{4+}{-}\\mathrm{OH}$   on the spinel  oxide’s surface are shown in  Figure   3 a. Compared with   ${\\cal C}{\\o}_{0}^{3+}$  ,   $C o^{4+}$  has a low energy 3d  state and would produce higher hybridization due to the shortened energy distance  between the TM 3d and O 2p states.  It is  reported that the metal–oxygen covalency  factor (i.e., charge transfer energy) bridges  the understanding of OER via different  reaction mechanisms.  Thus, we discuss  the OER activity of the investigated spinel  oxides as a function of   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$   covalency in  Figure 3b. With the OER activity displayed  by the potentials required to drive a specific  current density of   $25~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\mathrm{_\\mathrm{ox}},$   the   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$    covalency is predicted by the  N-V  parameter  (  $N$  is the number of unpaired electrons of  Co atom,   $V$  is the nominal valence state  of Co cation.).  The lower the   $N{\\cdot}V$   value,  the greater the   $\\mathrm{TM}{-}\\mathrm{O}$  covalency.  This is  because the parameter  N-V  is indicative of  the net ability of TM cation to donate electrons. The lower the ability of the TM to  donate electrons to the oxygen, the higher  the probability that the TM drags the electronic density slightly away from the oxygen  atom and thus leading to a greater TM-O  covalency.  As displayed in Figure 3b,  the parameter   $N\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\,V$  well describes the OER  activity of the substituted spinel oxides. To be  specific, an increased   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$   covalency gives  a higher OER activity and vice versa.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/c6fa5d3569144bc2bc69bd5ad71957a102a144cefb5299c1a828da6a07a7765b-1727118786.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   a) The background correction and  iR  correction  of OER CV curves performed  in  $\\mathsf{O}_{2}$  -saturated 0.1  m  KOH (scan rate:   $10\\mathrm{\\mV\\s^{-1}}$  , rotation speed:   $1600\\ \\mathsf{r p m})$  . b)\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
