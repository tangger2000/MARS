Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

As shown in  Figure   5 a, the electro spinning  time and polarization voltage are set to 1 min and   $5\\;\\mathrm{kV}.$  . When  the mass ratio of PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   are kept at 8, 6, 3, 2, 1.50,  1, and 0.80, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device is 25, 36, 87, 170, 21,  20, and   $15~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, indicating that the output of  PENG with the mass ratio of PVDF to  ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   to be 2 exhibits  the best one. As for the electro spinning time, the mass ratio  of PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   is 2 and the polarization voltage is   $5~\\mathrm{kV}$  (Figure 5b). When the electro spinning time is kept at 0.50, 1, 5,  and   $10\\ \\mathrm{min}$  , the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device is 15, 170, 23, and   $18~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, implying that the output of PENG with  the electro spinning time for  $1\\,\\mathrm{{min}}$   exhibits the best output. As  for the polarization voltage, the mass ratio of PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  is 2 and the electro spinning time is 1 min (Figure 5c). When  the polarization voltages are kept at 0, 2, and   $5\\ \\mathrm{kV},$   the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device is 0, 27, and   $170~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively,  implying that the output of PENG with the polarization voltage  for   $5~\\mathrm{kV}$   exhibits the best output. The effect of the fabrication  methods of in situ growth and two-step method on the performance of PENG is also investigated by fixing the mass ratio of  PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   to be 2, the electro spinning time of 1 min and  the polarization voltage of   $5\\;\\mathrm{kV.}$   The density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   is detected to  be 170 and   $18~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   by using in situ growth method and  two-step growth method, respectively, implying that the  PENG with in situ growth method exhibits the best output  (Figure  5d).

In addition, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   has a tendency  to aggrandize with the increase of the number of cycles in the  cyclic stability curve (Figure 5e), which is caused by the charge  accumulation from the incomplete discharge during the cyclic  charging and discharging processes.

As shown in  Figure   6 a, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  PVDF composite fibers based PENG with in situ growth method  is only   $13~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   when the final velocity is   $1\\textrm{m s}^{-1}$   and the  output increases as the final speed increases until the velocity  reaches   $10\\;\\mathrm{m}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . Hence, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   reaches a maximum  of   $170\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at  $10\\ \\mathrm{m\\s^{-1}}$  . The output of the PENG is affected  by the frequency through many factors, including deformation recovery time, applied force and accumulated charge. As  shown in Figure 6b, the output of the PENG keeps  $170\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$    under the interference of frequency fluctuation, which is not  affected by the frequency of the applied force ranging from  0.30 to   $6~\\mathrm{Hz}$  . The mainly reasons are as follows. First, since  the factors including acceleration, final speed and impact time  of the linear motor are precisely controlled, the force applied to  PENG remains strictly unchanging when testing the frequency  characteristics. Second, in the low frequency range of  $0.3–6~\\mathrm{Hz}$  ,  the electrons in the external circuit have sufficient time to balance the piezoelectric potential. Finally, when the force along  the radial direction of the fiber is removed, PENG can quickly  return to the initial position. Therefore,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers based PENG can complete the task of collecting  and converting energy in different frequency ranges, greatly  expanding the application range.  \n\nThe output characteristics of PENG are affected to some extent  by the external load.
