Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

PTAA and QD layers were baked at   $120~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  15  min and   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\\ m i n$  , respectively, before the deposition of  the next layer. TPBi   $(40\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m})$   and LiF/Al electrodes   $(\\uparrow\\,\\textsf{n m}/\\uparrow00\\,\\textsf{n m})$    were deposited using a thermal evaporation system through a shadow  mask under a high vacuum of   ${\\approx}2\\times\\,{\\mid}\\,0^{-4}$    Pa. The device active area  was   $4\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}^{2}$   as defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Al  electrodes.  \n\nCharacterization and Device Measurements : One drop of the diluted  as-synthesized   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QD dispersion was placed onto a carbon-coated   $\\mathsf{C u}$   grid, and octane was allowed to evaporate at room temperature.  TEM and HRTEM images were taken on a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN  TEM instrument operated at an acceleration voltage of   $200\\ \\mathrm{kV}$   and  equipped with high angle annular dark field scanning transmission  electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) and an energy dispersive X-ray  spectroscopy (EDX) detector. XRD samples were prepared by dropping  the purified QD inks onto glass substrates. XRD patterns were acquired  using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffract o meter operating with Cu K α radiation   $(\\lambda=1.5406\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  ). To evaluate film roughness, QD inks were  spin-coated onto Si substrates and then analyzed by a Veeco D3100  AFM tool. The absorbance of QD octane solution was measured by a  Shimadzu UV-3600 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer. The PL spectra of  the QDs were obtained by using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer.  XPS spectra were recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB-250 spectrometer  using a monochromatic Al KR radiation source (1486.6  eV). XPS  samples were prepared by dropping the purified QD inks onto Si wafers.  The absolute PLQY was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog system  equipped with a single grating and a Quanta-Phil integration sphere  coupled to the Fluorolog system. The PL delay was measured on a timecorrelated single-photo counting (TCSPC) spec tro flu oro meter (FLS920,  Edinburg Instrument, UK) at room temperature. The EL spectra,   $L\\mathrm{-}J\\mathrm{-}V$    characteristics and EQE were collected by using a Keithley 2400 source,  a fibre integration sphere, and a PMA-12 spectrometer for light output  measurements in a glove box filled with   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   and at room temperature  (the measurements equipment was designed by Hamamatsu Photonics  Co., Ltd.).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was financially supported by the National Key Research and  Development Program of China (2016 Y FB 0401701), NSFC (Grant  Nos. 61604074, 51572128, 51672132, and 61725402), the Natural Science  Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20160827), China Postdoctoral  Science Foundation (2016 M 590455), the Fundamental Research Funds  for the Central Universities (Grant Nos. 30917011202, 30915012205, and  30916015106), and PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\nelectroluminescence, light-emitting diodes, per ovsk ites, quantum dots,  surface ligands  \n\nReceived: February 3, 2018 Revised: April 22, 2018 Published online:  \n\n[1]\t Y. Shang, Z. Ning,  Natl. Sci. Rev.   2017 ,  4 , 170.\n\n [2]\t Y. X. Yang, Y. Zheng, W. R. Cao, A. Titov, J. Hyvonen, J. R. Manders,  J. G. Xue, P. H. Holloway, L. Qian,  Nat. Photonics   2015 ,  9 , 259.\n\n [3]\t Y. Shirasaki, G. J. Supran, M. G. Bawendi, V. Bulovic,  Nat. Photonics   2013 ,  7 , 13.\n\n [4]\t X.  W.  Gong, Z.  Y.  Yang, G.  Walters, R.  Comin, Z.  J.  Ning,  E. Beauregard, V. Adinolfi, O. Voznyy, E. H. Sargent,  Nat. Photonics   2016 ,  10 , 253.\n\n [5]\t B.  S.  Mashford, M.  Stevenson, Z.  Popovic, C.  Hamilton,  Z.  Q.  Zhou, C.  Breen, J.  Steckel, V.  Bulovic, M.  Bawendi,  S. Coe-Sullivan, P. T. Kazlas,  Nat. Photonics   2013 ,  7 , 407.\n\n [6]\t V. Colvin, M. Schlamp, A. P. Alivisatos,  Nature   1994 ,  370 , 354.\n\n [7]\t L.  Wang, J.  Lin, Y.  Hu, X.  Guo, Y.  Lv, Z.  Tang, J.  Zhao, Y.  Fan,  N. Zhang, Y. Wang,  ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces   2017 ,  9 , 38755.\n\n [8]\t Y. T. Zou, M. Y. Ban, W. Cui, Q. Huang, C. Wu, J. W. Liu, H. H. Wu,  T. Song, B. Q. Sun,  Adv. Funct. Mater.   2017 ,  27 , 1603325.\n\n [9]\t X.  L.  Dai, Z.  X.  Zhang, Y.  Z.  Jin, Y.  Niu, H.  J.  Cao, X.  Y.  Liang,  L. W. Chen, J. P. Wang, X. G. Peng,  Nature   2014 ,  515 , 96.\n\n [10]\t H. C. Wang, S. Y. Lin, A. C. Tang, B. P. Singh, H. C. Tong, C. Y. Chen,  Y. C. Lee, T. L. Tsai, R. S. Liu,  Angew. Chem., Int. Ed.   2016 ,  55 , 7924.\n\n [11]\t J. Lim, M. Park, W. K. Bae, D. Lee, S. Lee, C. Lee, K. Char,  ACS Nano   2013 ,  7 , 9019.\n\n [12]\t J.-H. Kim, H. Yang,  Chem. Mater.   2016 ,  28 , 6329.\n\n [13]\t M. A. Green, A. Ho-Baillie, H. J. Snaith,  Nat. Photonics   2014 ,  8 , 506.\n\n [14]\t J.  You, L.  Meng, T.-B.  Song, T.-F.  Guo, Y.  M.  Yang, W.-H.  Chang,  Z. Hong, H. Chen, H. Zhou, Q. Chen,  Nat. Nano techno l.   2016 ,  11 ,  75.  \n\n[15]\t E.  M.  Sanehira, A.  R. \nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
