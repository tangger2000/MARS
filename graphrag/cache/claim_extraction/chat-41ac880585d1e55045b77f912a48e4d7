This work demonstrates the invaluable role of homochirality in designing 2D LIPFs. Such breaking down of barriers to exploring 2D LIPFs will inspire substantial efforts for the continuous flourish ment of ferroelectric devices, PV materials, and op to electronic devices. R -LIPF, S -LIPF, and the racemic counterpart rac -LIP were obtained as plate-like orange crystals in HI solution containing stoic hio metric amounts of $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ and the corresponding R -, S -, and rac -1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethylamine. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirms the phase purity of the as-grown crystals (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Their chiral features were then investigated by the vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) measurement. The IR spectra of R -LIPF and S -LIPF crystals are almost the same, while the VCD spectra are nearly mirror images ( Figure 1 ), providing solid evidence for the enantiomorphic nature of $R\\cdot$ and  S -LIPF crystals. In contrast, the  rac -LIP  crystal shows no VCD signal, although the similar IR spectra are observed. The measured VCD spectra of  $R\\cdot$  and  S -LIPF  exhibits several pairs of relatively strong VCD signal $(\\Delta\\varepsilon)$ at  1440, 1361, 1163, 1093, 1062, and   $956~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , which correspond exactly to the specific infrared vibration peaks. From the calculated VCD and IR spectra (Figure S2, Supporting Information),  the VCD signal at   $956~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   can be attributed to the stretch vibration of   $_{\\mathrm{C-C}}$   bond from the chiral center of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl ammonium cation in the structure. ![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/1343164d39f3686e0b611565f7b22d3a05b176d57e885c164b41f5ea352b5b34-1727122913.jpg) Figure 1. Experimentally measured VCD and IR spectra for  R -LIPF,  S -LIPF, and  rac -LIP. The crystal structures in the three compounds can be  described as the 2D   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{3})_{2}\\mathrm{BX}_{4}$  -type layered perovskite structure, which is derived from the parent 3D   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   one.  Taking  single (100)-oriented layers from the 3D framework in the  3D   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   perovskite structure obtains the 2D   $\\mathrm{BX_{4}}^{2-}$   layers of  corner-sharing   ${\\mathrm{BX}}_{6}$   octahedra, which alternate with the   $\\mathrm{RNH}_{3}{}^{+}$  bilayers to form the 2D   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{3})_{2}\\mathrm{BX}_{4}$   perovskite structure.  In  the three compounds, the structures consist of corner-sharing   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedron layers separated by 1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethylammonium cationic bilayers ( Figure  2 ; Figure S3, Supporting  Information), similar to those of typical 2D   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{3})_{2}\\mathrm{BX}_{4}$   perovskites   $(\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3}})_{2}\\mathrm{PbI_{4}}$   and   $(\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{5}C_{2}H_{4}N H_{3}})_{2}\\mathrm{PbI_{4}}$  .  Thus,  all the three compounds are 2D   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{3})_{2}\\mathrm{BX}_{4}$   per ovsk ites. At   $293\\;\\mathrm{~K}_{z}$  ,  R -LIPF and  S -LIPF crystallize in the space group  P 1,  belonging to the chiral polar point group 1   $\\left(C_{1}\\right)$   (Table S1,  Supporting Information). The two en anti om orphic structures  have a mirror-plane relationship, in which the four independent  1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethyl ammonium cations show   $R$  and  S  config u rations in  R -LIPF and  S -LIPF, respectively (Figure  2a,b).  Their racemic mixture  rac -LIP, however, adopts a centrosymmetric   $P2_{1}/c$   space group of   $2/m$   point group, containing only  one 1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethyl ammonium cation in the basic unit  (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The 1-(4-chl oro phenyl) ethyl ammonium cations in all the three structures exhibit  ordered state. Interestingly, the cations connect with the inorganic layer not only through the commonly seen   $\\mathrm{N{-}H{\\cdot}{\\cdot}I}$  hydrogen bonds but also through weak   $_{\\mathrm{C-Cl\\cdotsI-Pb}}$   bonds  (average Cl ⋅⋅⋅ I distance of   $3.976\\textup{\\AA}$   in  R -LIPF) (Figure 2c), which  is significantly distinct from that found in other layered perovskites.  The polar  P 1 space group in  R -, and  S -LIPF indicates  that they should have spontaneous polarization. We thus calculated the spontaneous polarization with a point charge model  by assuming that the positive and negative charge are on the  Pb, N atoms and I atom, respectively. A same spontaneous  polarization of   $13.96\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at   $293~\\mathrm{K}$   was obtained for   $R\\cdot$  , and  S -LIPF, and zero polarization for  rac -LIP. Differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC)  experiments  clearly show that   $R\\cdot$  - and  S -LIPF undergo a phase transition at around   $T_{{\\tt c}(R)}\\,=\\,483\\,\\mathrm{~K~}$   and   $T_{{\\tt c}(S)}\\,=\\,473.2\\,\\mathrm{\\boldmath~K}_{\\!s}$  , respectively  ( Figure  3 a,c). Such a high transition temperature is among the greatest one in molecular ferroelectric s, and significantly  larger than those of other organic–inorganic perovskite ferro electrics such as (benz yl ammonium)  $\\mathsf{\\Omega}_{2}\\mathsf{P b C l}_{4}$   (436 K),  (cy clo hex yl ammonium)  $\\mathsf{\\Omega}_{2}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{4}$   (363 K),  and   $[\\mathrm{Me}_{3}\\mathrm{NCH}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}]$   $\\mathrm{MnBr}_{3}$   (415 K),  as well as some inorganic perovskite ferroelectrics including   ${\\mathrm{BaTiO}}_{3}$   (393 K).

The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.
