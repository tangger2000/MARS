Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

According to the results shown in Figure   $4\\mathrm{c}$  , not only they  are stable but also their efficiencies increased gradually with  increasing storage period. For the E1 device, the PCE increased  from   $6.8\\%$   when freshly prepared up to   $8.4\\%$   after storage for   $2000\\,\\mathrm{h}$  ; for the E1G20 device, the PCE increased gradually from  initial   $7.3\\%$   to maximum value   $9.6\\%$   after storage for   $2000\\mathrm{~h~}$  (Figure S9, Supporting Information). This is the first time  that a tin-based perovskite solar cell has attained such a great  device performance with outstanding stability. The fresh best  cell was sent to a qualified PV Efficiency Verification Laboratory in Taiwan for certification of the device performance  under standard testing conditions (STC) following the IEC  60904 procedure to meet the ISO/IEC 17025 standard. The  device to be certified was assembled according to a standard  procedure shown in Figure S10 (Supporting Information). Even  though the verification proceeded under strict conditions, our  cell was stable enough to pass all certification steps. A certified  performance with   $\\mathrm{PCE}=8.30\\pm0.29\\%$   was eventually obtained  (Figure 4d; Figure S11, Supporting Information), which marks  a new milestone for a tin-based perovskite solar cell to be  certified with such great device performance and stability.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available online from the Wiley Online Library  or from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nThis work was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST),  Taiwan (Grant Nos.
