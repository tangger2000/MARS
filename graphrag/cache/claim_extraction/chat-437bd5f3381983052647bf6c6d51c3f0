Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Perovskite is abbreviated as PVSK.  \n\nBased on density functional theory, Ab initio molecular  dynamics simulations have been employed to study the chemÂ­ ical interaction between interface molecules and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   as well  as per ovsk ites. The electrostatic potentials (ESP) of these modiÂ­ fiers were calculated and shown inÂ   FigureÂ  2 a. It was easily  seen that electron cloud density of these molecules mainly  distributed on   $\\mathrm{C=O}$  . Hence, the   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   in these modification  molecules has strong Lewis base properties, which can coorÂ­ dinate with oxygen vacancy defects in   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and under coord iÂ­ nated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   in per ovsk ites. Similar electrostatic potentials were  observed for all modifiers. So the steric hindrance remarkably  affects the adsorption of modification molecules on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   or  perovskite. Then we carried out molecular dynamics to find  the stable absorption configuration of AD, ADCA, and ADAA  molecules on (110) plane of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   with oxygen vacancy and on   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   terminated surface of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   with iodine vacancy, respecÂ­ tively. FigureÂ   $2\\mathrm{c}\\mathrm{-}\\mathrm{f}$   exhibits the optimized structures of defective   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   surface without and with AD, ADCA, and ADAA. The  optimized structures of defective   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   surface without and  with AD, ADCA, and ADAA are displayed in FigureÂ   $2\\mathrm{g}\\mathrm{-}\\mathrm{i}$  . The  binding energies   $(E_{\\mathrm{b}})$   are summarized in FigureÂ 2b. It is found  that   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   of AD, ADCA, and ADAA on   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  surface was   $-2.61$  ,   $-2.43$  , and   $-2.29\\,\\mathrm{\\eV},$   respectively. The smaller the steric hinÂ­ drance of modification molecules is, the stronger the binding  energy is, which is in accordance with the XPS experimental  results. In our simulations, we found that the oxygen atom of  modifiers is at the oxygen vacancy of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   during the whole  process with a temperature of   $300\\,\\mathrm{~K~}$  , indicating effective pasÂ­ sivation of modification molecules for oxygen vacancy defects  at the surface of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film. Moreover, the defect pass iv ation  effect increases in the order of AD, ADCA, and ADAA. The pasÂ­ sivation effects of AD, ADCA, and ADAA on under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   and iodine vacancy defects were also investigated by moleÂ­ cular dynamic simulations. The   $E_{\\flat}$   of AD, ADCA, and ADAA  on   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   surface was  âˆ’ 1.13,  $-1.50$  , and   $-1.60~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively,  which was found to possess a similar binding energy variation  behavior as that of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   surface.

The conductivity of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   films was increased in the  order of control, AD, ADCA, and ADAA (FigureÂ S2, Supporting  Information), which is in good agreement with the concentration  change tendency of oxygen vacancy defects within   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   films.  This shows that improved conductivity is ascribed to the effective  pass iv ation of modification molecules for oxygen vacancy defects  of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   films. As exhibited in FigureÂ S3 (Supporting InformaÂ­ tion), the contact angle of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   films was gradually increased  after modification from AD, ADCA to ADAA. This is because  adamantane ring in these modifiers is very hydrophobic. Huang  etÂ al.  found that the substrate with appropriate hydrophobic it y  is favorable for suppressing heterogeneous nucleation and proÂ­ moting homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, which enabled  the preparation of high-aspect-ratio perovskite grains.  \n\nWe investigated the morphology of the control and modiÂ­ fied perovskite films through top-view and cross-sectional scanÂ­ ning electron microscope (SEM) measurement. It was clearly  found in FigureÂ  S4 (Supporting Information) that the grain  size of perovskite films was slightly enlarged after inter facial  modification. The grains of the modified perovskite films were  across the whole film thickness while the cross section of the  control film was composed of small grains. Compared with the  control film, more compact and smoother cross sections were  achieved for the modified samples. The increased grain size  and improved compactness and smoothness are put down to  suppressed heterogeneous nucleation resulting from enhanced  hydrophobic it y of crystal substrates. Improved morphology  should be conducive to facilitating carrier transport and supÂ­ pressing charge non radiative recombination.  \n\nThe crystal structure and crystal lin it y of the perovskite layer  were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The diffraction peak  positions and intensities of modified perovskite films did not  change compared with the control films, indicating that the  crystal structure and crystal lin it y were almost not affected by  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/34b551366d18551be8f6db8693d285b62930f5c55e4ba7e2d3ded6b1ab0acb10-1727104857\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
