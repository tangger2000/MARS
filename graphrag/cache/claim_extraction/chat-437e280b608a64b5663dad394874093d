Hydrogen gas, which can be  harnessed from the water electrolysis, is  believed as an ideal energy carrier in the  future clean energy infrastructure. However, the energy efficiency of the water  electrolysis is hindered by the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction  (OER) at the anode. To date,   $\\mathrm{{lrO}_{2}}$   and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   have been identified as the benchmark catalysts for the OER. However, the  scarcity and high price of Ir and Ru have  cast shadow over its wide application.  Thus, considerable effort is now being  given globally in searching for low-cost  OER catalysts as alternatives.  Transition  metal spinel oxides appear to be a class of  promising candidates owing to their element abundance and remarkable activities.  Special attention has been given to some  Co-containing spinel oxides as they afford  high catalytic OER activity and durability.  \n\nCobalt-containing spinel oxides are promising electro catalysts for the oxygen  evolution reaction (OER) owing to their remarkable activity and durability.  However, the activity still needs further improvement and related fundamentals remain untouched. The fact that spinel oxides tend to form cation  deficiencies can differentiate their electro catalysis from other oxide materials,  for example, the most studied oxygen-deficient per ovsk ites. Here, a syste­ matic study of spinel  $\\mathsf{Z n F e}_{x}\\mathsf{C o}_{2-x}\\mathsf{O}_{4}$   oxides   $(x=0–2.0)$   toward the OER is presented and a highly active catalyst superior to benchmark  $\\mathsf{I r O}_{2}$   is developed.  The distinctive OER activity is found to be dominated by the metal–oxygen  covalency and an enlarged  $\\mathtt{c o-o}$   covalency by  $\\mathbf{\\rceil_{0-30\\,a t\\%}}$   Fe substitution  is responsible for the activity enhancement. While the pH-dependent OER  activity of  $\\mathsf{Z n F e}_{0.4}\\mathsf{C o}_{1.6}\\mathsf{O}_{4}$   (the optimal one) indicates decoupled proton– electron transfers during the OER, the involvement of lattice oxygen is not  considered as a favorable route because of the down shifted O p-band center  relative to Fermi level governed by the spinel’s cation deficient nature.  \n\nThe escalating demands for energy resources across the world  are speeding up the depletion of fossil fuels and have generated severe environmental issues. Gradually replacing the fossil  energy infrastructure with a clean and sustainable one is an  important aspect that human being should put considerable  \n\nSubstituting Co with other transition metals (TMs) in spinel has  been found influential on tuning their catalytic activities. For  example, substituting some Co with   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{Zn}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{3-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}{^{[2\\mathrm{d}]}})$    or   $\\mathrm{Ni}$   (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{3-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}{}^{[3]})$   in   ${\\mathrm{Co}}_{3}{\\mathrm{O}}_{4}$   may promote the OER over  the pure   ${\\mathrm{Co}}_{3}{\\mathrm{O}}_{4}$  . The activity enhancement is preliminarily  explained by the substitution-induced morphology change. The more insightful explanation about the intrinsic origins  remained untouched. This contrasts starkly with the impressive progress made toward the fundamental understanding of  OER on perovskite oxides.  The interaction between B-site TM  3d and O 2p states has been the major perspective that have  guided the exploration of distinctive OER origin.  As TM  $\\mathrm{e_{g}}$  orbital exhibits a strong spatial overlap with O 2p orbital, the  $\\mathrm{e_{g}}$  occupancy, co determined by the d electron number and spin  state, has been concluded as the catalytic ally critical factor. The correlations made between OER activity and   $\\mathrm{e_{g}}$   states were  built under a four-step concerted proton–electron transfer  mechanism.  Most recently, the new understanding on the  lattice oxygen participated OER has been revealed on some  perovskite oxides  and increased metal–oxygen covalency has  been considered critical in promoting the OER kinetics.  \n\ndiffers from the Co-per ovsk ites because Zn spinels are generally categorized as p-type conducting oxides.  Utilizing X-ray  absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory  (DFT) calculation, a correlation between the OER catalysis and   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$   covalency has been established. Non concerted proton– electron transfers have been considered possible in spinel  oxides as the best-performing   $\\mathrm{ZnFe_{0.4}C o_{1.6}O_{4}}$   catalyst displays  significant pH dependence in OER. However, unlike the lattice  oxygen-mediated OER mechanism revealed in per ovsk ites,   we highlight the differences in the decoupled proton–electron  transfer pathways of spinel oxides owing to its cation-deficient  nature.  \n\nThe crystal structures of the synthesized   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$    spinel oxides   $(x=0–2.0)$   were confirmed by X-ray diffraction  (XR) analysis. As shown in  Figure   1 a, the diffraction peaks  of the as-synthesized   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$   and   $\\mathrm{ZnFe_{2}O_{4}}$   fit well with  that of the standard spinel oxides. Only a gradual peak shift  to lower angles can be observed as the Fe content increases  in   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$   oxides. The peak shifts, indicating certain  changes in the lattice parameter, are mainly due to the differences in ionic radius of Fe and Co elements. X-ray absorption  fine structure (XAFS) technique was performed to probe the  \n\nIt is expected that these insightful findings can bring  inspirations to the understanding of OER by spinel oxides  because spinel structure contains octahedra   $\\mathrm{TM}_{6}$   unit as  that of perov­ skite oxides.  Challenges still exist because,  on one hand, the defect chemistry perspective suggests  apparent catalytic differences between the two crystal  \n\nfamilies. It is noteworthy that the stateof-the-art perovskite OER catalysts (mostly  Co-based perovskite oxides, e.g., BSCF82,    $\\mathrm{Pr}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Ba}_{0.5}\\mathrm{CoO}_{3-\\delta}\\mathinner{[6b]}$   $\\mathrm{La}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\\mathrm{CoO}_{3-\\delta}{}^{[10]}$  etc. )  generally possess oxygen-deficient compositions. The concentration of oxygen vacancies  on the surface was claimed to be orders of  magnitude higher than that in the bulk.   It means the oxygen-deficient nature could  greatly modify the surface reactions. The  surface oxygen deficiencies in perovskite have  been proposed to be a critical component in  triggering or facilitating the oxygen-exchange  mechanism.  In contrast, most of the  spinel oxides tend to have cation deficiencies  (an  oxygen-excess  non stoic hio me try)   and exhibit p-type conductivity. This could  actually make a difference to the mechanistic  understanding of OER by spinel materials.  On the other hand, the fact that spinel also  contains tetrahedral geometry makes the  catalytic reactions more complicated. As TMs  have different geometric preferences, it generally produces structure reversal in mixedspinel oxides. The structure reversal has been  reported to be an influential factor on electrocatalysis.  The key in interpreting the OER  by the structure reversal depends greatly on  the modified octahedral environment.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/a0abbce7cf4ff18f72d86305201f4f3067554b9435505579aa4b1b6203dc8db2-1727118803.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   a) XRD patterns of   $\\mathsf{Z n F e}_{x}\\mathsf{C o}_{\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
