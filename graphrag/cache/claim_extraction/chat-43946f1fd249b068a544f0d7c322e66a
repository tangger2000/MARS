Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Hence, we encourage to consider the  switch time as one of the parameters for new thermo responsive  materials in future development.  \n\nAs for integrated techniques, one direction for further exploration is the combination of active control techniques with  thermo responsive smart windows, which have hitherto been  primarily considered as passive devices, controlled by temperature solely. For example, the electro thermal approach adds extra  control to cost-effective temperature-responsive smart windows,  competing with other commercially available costly electrochromic devices. However in contrast with one-time switch in  electro chromic devices, electro thermal smart window needs  constant heating to remain switched which is more energy consuming. How to cut down the energy consumption is a key to  promote the electro thermal windows. Moreover, it is vital that  integration performance should not be compromised. The integrated layers may affect transmittance and decrease the solar  modulation property. They may also defer the heat transfer,  which could affect the switch time as well as the heat retention  of windows. Additionally, integrated techniques should address  the toxicity and durability issue of the thermo chromic layer  considering the daily human contact with windows and decades service life of architecture windows. And there are likely  to be further, unexplored techniques that could be integrated  with thermo response to produce more efficient, sustainable,  and multi functional energy-efficient smart windows for buildings as well as other applications. Advances in ease of manufacture and cost-effectiveness for both thermo responsive and  integrated techniques are also necessary to bring these technologies from the laboratory to daily life.  \n\nFinally, energy-efficient smart windows hold much promise  for contributing to a future, eco-friendly world. However, there  is still much work needed to make energy-efficient smart windows a practicable solution. It is hoped that this summary will  arouse broader research interests in this field to accelerate  the development of energy-efficient smart windows through  application of suitable materials and integrated techniques,  by both exploring the tremendous existing library of scientific  knowledge and inspiring innovative research for functional  devices within and even beyond energy-efficient smart window  applications.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.K. and C.Z. contributed equally to this work.
