Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The incorporation of   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   aims to fix the spinel to a normal structure and gain exclusive information on the  catalytic ally critical octahedra. In addition,  it helps create a cation-deficient surface that  \n\nvalence state and local structure of TM in  $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$   spinel  oxides. The X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES)  shows that the absorption edges of Zn overlap well with that  of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   (Figure 1b). It signifies that the   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   cations are of a  valence state of   $+2$   (Figure 1e). While the edge energies of Fe  almost remain unchanged (Figure 1c), the absorption edges  of Co exhibit significance shifts (Figure 1d). The quantified  valence states by an integral method  (Figure 1e) show that  valence state of Fe remains at around  $+3$   and that of Co ranges  from   ${\\approx}{+}2.86$   to   $+3.34$  . The chemical formulas of the various  spinel oxides can be approximated as   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4+\\delta}$   where   $\\delta$  indicates the oxygen non stoic hio me try and ranges from   ${\\approx}0$   to  0.27.  The Fourier transform (FT) extended X-ray absorption  fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting  Information) show two inter atomic metal–metal distances at   ${\\approx}2.5$   Å   $(\\mathrm{TM_{O c t}-T M_{O c t}})$   and  $\\approx\\!3\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$     $(\\mathrm{TM_{Td}-T M_{T d}/T M_{T d}-T M_{O c t}})$   for  Co/Fe K-edge and one metal–metal distance at   $\\approx\\!3\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   for   $\\mathrm{Zn}$  K-edge. This indicates that   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   cations only occupy the tetrahedral sites.  The near normal spinel structure was further confirmed by the EXAFS curve fitting (Figure S1c and Table S1,  Supporting Information). The exclusive occupation of Fe and  Co in octahedral sites indicates that the catalytic contribution of  the investigated spinel oxides should be mainly from the edge $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}_{\\frac{x}{2}}\\mathrm{Co}_{1-\\frac{x}{2}}\\mathrm{O}_{6}\\right]$   sharing    octahedra unit.   \n\nAs some of the spinel oxides are of oxygen-excess nonstoichiometry, we examined the formation energy of point defects  (i.e., oxygen interstitial   $\\left(\\mathrm{O}_{i}\\right)$   and  $\\mathrm{Zn}$   vacancy   $(Z\\mathrm{n}_{V}))$   in the spinel  lattice. The calculated defect formation enthalpies are summarized in  Table   1  (DFT methodology can be found in the Supporting Information). The formation enthalpies of   $Z\\mathrm{n}_{V}$  are  less than that of   $\\mathrm{O}_{i}$   in each model spinel crystals   $\\mathrm{(ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$  and Fe  $\\mathrm{7cnCo_{2}O_{4}}$  ), which indicates that the formation of   $Z\\mathrm{n}_{V}$  is  more thermodynamic ally favorable than that of   $\\mathrm{O}_{i}$  . In addition,  the lower   $\\mathrm{Zn}_{V}$   formation enthalpies in the substituted spinels  than in   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$   suggest that the incorporation of Fe has promoted defects formation in the spinel lattice. The existence of   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   vacancies was detected in the most non stoic hio metric compositions as the ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma-optical  emission spectrometry) results show that the atomic ratio  of   $\\mathrm{Zn:}(\\mathrm{Co+Fe})$   is   ${\\approx}0.44{-}0.47$   (Table S2, Supporting Information). To further examine the TM electronic structure changes  induced by the substitution in the spinel lattice, Bader charge  analysis was conducted. Crystal models of   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Zn_{V}}$   $\\mathrm{Fe}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Zn}\\mathrm{Co}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$   (Figure S3, Supporting Information) were built  in order to achieve theoretical and experimental consistency.  To be specific, we introduced   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   vacancies in the substituted  spinel models, but not   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$  .
