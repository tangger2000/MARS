Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Indeed, we have attained much improved crystalline quality  as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. More specifically, powder XRD (Figure 1c) shows very sharp peaks at   $14.92^{\\circ}$  ,   $21.11^{\\circ}$  ,   $30.07^{\\circ}$  ,   $33.71^{\\circ}$  ,   $37.11^{\\circ}$  ,   $43.05^{\\circ}$  , and   $45.77^{\\circ}$  , corresponding to the (001), (110), (002), (210), (211), (220), and  (003) planes of the cubic   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   crystal structure, respectively.  Furthermore, the X-ray  $2\\theta$  scan on the maximal facet  of a typical   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   single crystal shows only (001), (002),  (003), and (004) diffraction peaks, suggesting well-structured  single-crystalline eminence (Figure 1d). All four major XRD  peaks were further examined carefully using the high-resolution X-ray rocking curve analyses (Figure 1e), with all showing  very small full width at half maximum (FWHM), only   $0.019^{\\circ}$  ,   $0.013^{\\circ}$  ,  $0.019^{\\circ}$  , and   $0.015^{\\circ}$  , respectively. Comparing to the single  crystals grown using identical parameters except at higher temperature   $100\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , the reference samples show much inferior  quality with the FWHM as wide as   $0.113^{\\circ}$  ,   $0.094^{\\circ}$  ,   $0.107^{\\circ}$  , and   $0.111^{\\circ}$   for four characteristic XRD peaks, respectively. In short,  the single crystal grown using the LTGC is clearly better, with  the largest FWHM reduced by   ${\\approx}88\\%$   and by   ${\\approx}84\\%$   in average.  It is worth noting that to our knowledge, the FWHM of   $0.013^{\\circ}$  is the lowest among all values measured in literature so far for  the perovskite   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   single crystals,  demonstrating the  superior quality of the crystal and excellence of the LTGC crystall iz ation technique.  \n\nIt has been well studied by independent groups that, for the  micro crystalline thin film   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$   based solar cells, humidity  has strong impact on their morphology, chemical stability, and  performance.  We therefore evaluated the influence of high  humidity on the stability of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   single crystals subjected to exposure to   ${\\approx}50{-}60\\%$   relative humidity (RH). For the  test, XRD was recorded once a day for 44 d, as shown in Figure S1  (Supporting Information). It is surprising to see that there is  no detectable change in the XRD signals after the long-term  exposure, suggesting that the   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   single crystal is very  stable in humid atmospheric environment, apparently due to  essentially eliminated grain boundaries, voids, etc. Figure S2  (Supporting Information) shows water contact angle tests on  a   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   single crystal, it is increased to   ${\\approx}107^{\\circ}$   from   $\\approx\\!74^{\\circ}$  as measured on the micro crystalline   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   thin film, suggesting that the   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   single crystal shows significantly  poorer wet t ability or higher water/moisture resistance.  \n\nA single crystal device was designed to further characterize  its electronic properties. For the test, Au coating was applied  on both sides of a thin single-crystal wafer, with the complete device architecture   $\\mathrm{{Au}/\\mathrm{{MABr}}_{3}}$   single-crystal wafer   $(2.6\\mathrm{\\mm})/\\mathrm{Au}$  . The area of Au electrode is   $3.14~\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$  , and the  its thickness is about   $150~\\mathrm{nm}$  . The dark current–voltage characteristic was measured. As shown in  Figure   2 a, the ohmic and  quadratic regions are distinctively separated at bias voltage of   $12.4~\\mathrm{V}\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$  . The trap density   $(n_{\\mathrm{trap}})$   can then be determined by  the trap-filled limit voltage using the equation  \n\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{trap}}=\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}{q L^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   represents the vacuum permittivity,   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   the relative  dielectric constant   $(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}=25.5)$  ),    $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   the onset voltage of the  trap-filled limit region,   $q$   the elementary charge   $(1.6\\,\\times\\,10^{-19}$    Coulomb), and   $L$   the single-crystal wafer thickness. According  to the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, the trap  density is determined to be   $5.2\\times10^{9}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . The technique was  used to evaluate and compare the trap density of the crystals  grown using both the high-temperature and LTGC processes.  Figure 2b and Table S1 (Supporting Information) summarize  statistical data of the trap density measured from eight pieces  of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   single crystals. It is found that, the trap density is  in the range of   $(29–192)\\times10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   for the crystals grown using  the high-temperature process at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , while\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
