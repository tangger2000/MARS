However, our results on CsFAMA-based  per ovsk ites did not reveal such an improvement in PCE; a significant decrease in PCE was observed (Figure S19, Supporting  Information). This may be related to formation of pinholes in  the perovskite films as shown in SEM images of Figure S20  (Supporting Information).  \n\nIn summary, we have revealed that unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals  lower the long-term stability of PSCs and that it is possible to  improve the stability by reducing unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   in perovskite  films. The degradation of PSCs was related to the photolysis  of unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals into metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   and   $\\mathrm{I}_{2}$   under light  illumination.

All the precursor materials for  perovskite layers such as CsI, FAI, MABr,  ${\\mathsf{P}}{\\mathsf{b}}|_{2}$  , and  $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   were purchased  from Tokyo Chemical Industry. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from  Merck. Chl oro benzene, DMF, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and dopant  materials for the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, such as LiTFSI, 4-tBP, and FK-209,  were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The above purchased materials  were used without further purification.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : Glass substrates coated with a pre-patterned  indium tin oxide (ITO) layer with a thickness of   $100\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n m}$  (Atsugi  Micro) and a sheet resistance of   $\\mathsf{I0~Q~s q}^{-1}$   were cleaned sequentially  by ultrasonic ation in detergent, pure water, acetone, and iso prop an ol  each for   $10\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$   and then subjected to UV–ozone treatment for   $15~\\mathsf{m i n}$  .  After the substrate cleaning, the   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL was deposited on the ITO  layer by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  by using an aqueous   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$    colloidal solution, which was diluted to   $2.67\\%$   in water. The   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL  was annealed at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$  and then treated by UV–ozone for   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . The CsFAMA-based perovskite layer was prepared according  to literature.  The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by  mixing of FAI   $(1.10~\\mathrm{M})$  ,   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$     $(1.12~\\mathrm{M})$  , MABr   $(0.2~\\mathrm{M})$  , and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   (  $(0.2\\,\\mathrm{~M~})$    in anhydrous DMF/DMSO (4:1  vol/vol).   $0.08~\\mathrm{~M~}$  CsI was added to the  aforementioned precursor solution from a stock solution of   $\\mathsf{T.5\\\\M\\ C s i}$    in DMSO. Additionally, two different precursor solutions, in which  only the   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   concentration was changed to 1.15 or   $1.18~\\mathrm{~M~}$  , were also  prepared. These precursor solutions were stirred at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $^\\textrm{\\scriptsize5h}$   and  then filtered through a   $0.2\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   PTFE filter before use.

Ten seconds before the substrate rotation was  stopped,   $120~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   of chl oro benzene was dropped on the substrates to  obtain better-developed perovskite films. Subsequently, the substrates  were annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for 45  min.
