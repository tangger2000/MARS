Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

For the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, the gullies in  the porous surface have become shallow and the ridges have  widened, which is probably due to the increased crystal lin it y  of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with the addition of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  . The cross-sectional SEM images demonstrate that the control and optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films are compact (Figure 2c,d). AFM images indicate  that the surficial root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the optimized film   $(8.2\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   is significantly lower than that of the control film   $(14.6\\;\\mathrm{nm})$  ) (Figure 2e,f).  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  can effectively passivate the trap states in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite film, so the application of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  film with   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive as the photo active layer is expected  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/5dd64870f55ce56a5b544e43617e375baf52a0d2d4064bd88618f00839c6bc3d-1723829585.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   a)  $J-V$  curves of the  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PSCs with different concentrations of   $\\mathsf{C a C}|_{2}$   additive. b) EQE of the control and optimized   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PSCs.  c) Stable output curves of the current densities and efficiencies for the control and optimized   $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{2}$  Br PSCs. d) Schematic energy level diagram of the  control and optimized  $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PSCs. e) Mott–Schottky plots for the control and optimized   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PSCs. f) Nyquist plots of the control and optimized  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PSCs; the inset depicts the equivalent circuit employed to fit the Nyquist plots.  \n\nto lead to high performance solar cells.

The best control PSC displays an efficiency of   $14.89\\%$   with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.25~\\mathrm{V}.$  . With the optimized   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive  concentration, all the photovoltaic parameters are improved,  and a record efficiency of   $16.79\\%$   was obtained with a highest   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.32\\ \\mathrm{V}.$   This efficiency is distinctly higher than that of  the control sample   $(14.89\\%)$   and other reported results, which  are summarized in Table S3 in the Supporting Information.  The remarkable enhancement in these photovoltaic performance parameters should be ascribed to the improved optoelectronic properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive. The  excellent photovoltaic performance of the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  PSCs is also supported by external quantum efficiency (EQE)  and stable power output (SPO) measurements.

Both integrated current values agree with the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   measured from the   $J{-}V$  curves   $(\\approx\\!1\\%$   mismatch).

Figure  3c gives the SPOs of the control and optimized devices obtained while tracking at the maximum power  point.

The control and optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films are  n-type semiconductors (Fermi levels are close to the conduction bands). The energy difference between the valence bands  of the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film and Spiro-OMeTAD is remarkably smaller than that of the control film, which means that  the energy loss for hole transfer from the valence band of the  perovskite to Spiro-OMeTAD is smaller.
