Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The peak intensity of N 1s becomes stronger with the increase  of treatment time. The fitted N 1s core-level spectrum of the   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene nanosheets is shown in Figure S2c, Supporting Information, the peak at   $399.32\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   is ascribed to the  N-H.  On the contrary, the peak intensity of F 1s decreases  as the treatment time increases, and the peak disappears after  the treatment time reaches   $12\\textrm{h}$   (Figure 2c).

Therefore, we believe that the   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   groups  have been successfully grafted to the surface of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene  nanosheets after   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   treatment, which is similar to the  grafting of   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   to the surface of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets by  replacing the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups.  The Fourier transform infrared  (FTIR) spectroscopy is applied to further investigate the surface  states of the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets treated with   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   for  different times, as shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information. The peak located at   $972~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   is assigned to the stretching  vibration of   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups. The intensity of   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups gradually  decreases as the   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   treatment time increases and the peak  disappears when the treatment time reaches   $12\\textrm{h}$  . Meanwhile,  the peaks located at 3113 and   $3167~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   attributed to the -  $\\cdot\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  groups appear after the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets are treated  with   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   for   $3\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$  , which further implies the   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   groups  are successfully grafted onto the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets.  The XPS measurements and the FTIR spectrum indicate  that when the treatment time reaches   $12\\,\\textrm{h}$  , the surface terminated   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups are completely replaced by the   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  groups. The UPS measurements are measured to investigate  the effect of the surface   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   groups on the WF of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene nanosheets (Figure  2d). The WF can be calculated by   $\\mathrm{VF}=21.22{\\cdot}E_{\\mathrm{cutoff}},$  , where  $E_{\\mathrm{cutoff}}$   is the binding energy of the secondary electron cutoff.

Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements are further applied to investigate the WF difference of these   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene nanosheets treated with   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$  for different times  (Figure 2e,f and Figure S4, Supporting Information). The WF  of the AFM tip is calibrated as   $\\mathrm{WF_{tip}}=4.60\\,\\mathrm{eV}.$  . The WF of the  sample   $\\mathrm{(WF_{sample})}$   is obtained by the formula:   $e V_{\\mathrm{CPD}}=\\mathrm{\\nabla{W}F_{\\mathrm{tip}}-}$   $\\mathrm{WF_{sample}}$   (e is the elementary charge;   $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CPD}}$   is the contact  potential difference between the AFM tip and the sample). A  high   $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CPD}}$   value means a low WF of the sample.  The   $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{CPD}}$  values of the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   and   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets are \n\n  $-89$   and   $223\\;\\mathrm{\\mV}$   and the corresponding WF are 4.69 and \n\n  $4.38\\,\\mathrm{\\eV},$   respectively.   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets treated with \n\n  $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   for 3, 7, and   $^{18\\mathrm{~h~}}$   are 22, 153, and   $218\\ \\mathrm{mV}$   and the cor- responding WF are 4.58, 4.45, and   $4.38\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   respectively. The  WF values are close to those obtained from the UPS measurements, which suggests that the   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$  treatment can effectively  decrease the WF of the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets by replacing  the surface terminated  $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups with   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   groups.  \n\nThe WF of the semiconductor is defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level   $(E_{\\mathrm{vac}})$   and its Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$  .   The WF difference of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene caused by different surface terminated groups are analyzed according to the movement  of the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
