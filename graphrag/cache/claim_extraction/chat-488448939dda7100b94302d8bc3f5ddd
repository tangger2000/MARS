Most used polymers include polymethyl meth a cry late (PMMA), epoxy resin (ER), polystyrene (PS), or  polyethylene oxide (PEO), which are extremely versatile and commercial safe products widely used in industry and daily life. The  advantages of encapsulation by polymers are as follows.  \n\nRemarkably, one of the advantages is a good dispersion of  PQDs in polymers by proper controlling the inter facial layers.  Especially, these hydrophobic side chains always interact  with the surface of PQDs, inducing a uniform distribution  and uneasy detachment.  The hydrophobic semi crystalline  property of PVDF makes them a good solubility in common  solvents.  Zhou et al. fabricated   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbBr_{3}@P V D F}$   film with   $8\\,\\mathrm{\\wt\\%}$   loaded content still maintained good transparency in  wide wavelengths   $(540{-}900\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ). They studied the process in  detail and thought that in situ formation of   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbBr_{3}@P V D F}$  was divided into three stages as the transparent precursor solution formation containing a mixture of MABr   $(0.64\\ \\mathrm{mm})$  ,   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$     $\\mathrm{{(0.8\\;mmol)}}$  ), and PVDF (4.2 g) (stage I), the crystallization  processes of PVDF (stage II) and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   (stage III). They  thought that separating stage II and stage III is the key factor  for fabricating   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbBr_{3}@P V D F}$   films with high efficiency.  The XPS results showed that the F 1s peak of PVDF exhibited  a   $0.3\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   shift from   $686.3\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   of pure PVDF film to   $686.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$  for composite films, suggesting strong interactions between   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$   of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{-CF_{2}}$   groups of PVDF. The intensities evolution of transmittance   $(\\approx\\!510\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) and PL   $(\\approx\\!525\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  )  peak with time prolonged in stage III indicated the relative  slow growth process limited by the spatial confinement from  PVDF matrix. Therefore, the key step for PQDs wrapped in  PVDF was the favorable interactions between   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   and hydrophobic side chains   $\\mathrm{(-CF_{2}-}$   groups) of PVDF. Thus,   $\\mathrm{\\mathbb{M}A P b X_{3}@}$  PVDF composite films are transparent with enhanced tunable  PL properties, which exhibit PLQYs of   $94.6~\\pm~1\\%$   (green),   $38.4\\pm1\\%$   (blue), and   $11\\pm1\\%$   (red), respectively.  \n\nMeyns and co-workers incorporated PQDs in the poly(maleic  anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMA) lattice.  The PLQYs of both   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   and  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1.6}\\mathrm{I}_{1.4}$   PQDs increased slightly but reproducibly from   $49\\pm4\\%$   to   $53\\pm4\\%$   and from   $84\\pm3\\%$   to   $88\\pm1\\%$  ,  respectively. Compared with bare samples, the NMR and IR spectroscopy indirectly proved the presence of PMA on the surface of  PQDs. Afterward, the PMA units were polymerization utilizing  a diamine, which allows sealing of PQD cores. Then, the evaporated solvent led to radical polymerization to from surface ligand  as well as cross linking between two adjacent PQD surface when  a cross linker was added. Sun et  al. introduced V18 to protect   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   QDs and maintained a narrow FWHM in the range  of   $25\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   and high PLQYs ranging from   $75\\%$   to   $100\\%$   with a  homogeneous morphology. They concluded that the ammonium  center of V18 with two methyl groups allowed a sufficient ionic  interaction between perovskite surface and styryl group, allowing  polymerization to proceed from the surface ligand as well as  cross linking between two adjacent   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   QDs and the alkyl  side chain of V18, which imparts a high colloidal stability of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   QDs.  Besides, the long-chain hydrophobic PS block  can sterically stabilize lead precursors (during reaction), increase  colloidal stability (after reaction), and protect the PQDs against  chemical attacks from unfavorable environment.  \n\nThe other advantage is the flexible processing of polymer  such as spin-coated or any objects with desired shape or size by  thermal or optical treatment.  Figure   8 c displays a series of composite films with color-tunable emissions on glass substrates.  The   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbBr_{3}@S S D C}$   composites showed great mach inability  suitable for screen printing, painting pictures and flexible  coating as illustrated in Figure 8d. The PQDs  $@$  polymer composites such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}@\\mathrm{PMMA}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  PMBA and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PS}$   processed into transparent disks showed homogeneous morph o logie s, corresponding photos were observed in  Figure 8e under ambient room light and UV illumination, the  color differences were attributed to radical polymerization rates  and polarities between MMA, PMBA, and styrene.  \n\nAnother advantage is the great improvement of stability. PQDs  $@$  polymer films even exhibited an unprecedented fluorescence stability with no sign of degradation in both solvent  (ethanol, IPA) up to 50 days and ambient air for five months.  Raja et  al. even reported that the PLQYs of perovskite encapsulated into hydrophobic macroscale polymeric matrices  show no change even after   ${>}4$   months of continuous immersion in water.  Xuan et al. reported that the PLQYs of PQDs  embedded in super hydrophobic porous organic polymer  frameworks maintain   $91\\%$   (  $(\\mathrm{PLQY}\\approx54.3\\%)$   of the initial one   $(\\mathrm{PLQY}\\,\\approx\\,60\\%)$  ) after being immersed in water for 31 days. Wang et al. certificated the good stability of   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbBr_{3}@P M S R}$  films when immerging into water at different temperatures  or exposing upon UV light (Figure 8f,g). The phenyl rings of  PMSR guarantee a much lower water permeability.  And  the PLQYs of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}@\\mathrm{PMMA}$   and   $\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3}@$  PMMA com- posites were reduced from 62.4 to   $51.6\\%$   and from 49.8 to   $46.5\\%$  , respectively, after being maintained at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $24{\\mathrm{~h~}}$   in  nitrogen atmospheres.  Liu et  al. indicated that   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}@$  epoxy resin maintained   $87.4\\%$   of initial light-converting  efficiency after   $500\\,\\textrm{h}$   of accelerated aging at high temperature, demonstrating an outstanding stability.
