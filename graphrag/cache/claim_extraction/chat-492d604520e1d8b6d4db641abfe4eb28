materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

For paraelectric–ferroelectric phase transitions, large dielectric anomalies generally occur around   $T_{\\mathsf{c}},$   especially along the direction of   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$  .  As depicted in Figure  2b, the   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}$   (real part of complex  dielectric constant) along the   $b$  -axis of the single-crystal sample  presents a large change at   $422~\\mathrm{K}$   in the frequency range from  500 to   $1\\:\\mathrm{MHz}$  , and the maximum value of   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}$   is about 41 times  larger than the stable state at   $1\\:\\mathrm{MHz}$  , which is the representative feature of para electric–ferroelectric phase transition. By  contrast,   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}$   change along the   $a$  - and   $c$  -axis is about two and ten  times larger than those at the stable state at  $1\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$  , respectively  (inset of Figure  2b and Figure S3, Supporting Information).  Striking anisotropy proves that   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$   is along the   $b$  -axis, corresponding to the result of structural analysis. To further investigate ferro electricity of 1, we performed the measurements  of   $P{-}E$   (polarization–electric field) hysteresis loops along the   $b$  -axis at  $50~\\mathrm{Hz}$   at various temperatures by classical Sawyer–Tower  circuit. As shown in Figure 2c, the   $P{-}E$   hysteresis loops display  well-defined rectangle in the temperature range from 393 to   $413\\mathrm{~K~}$  , which clearly confirms\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
