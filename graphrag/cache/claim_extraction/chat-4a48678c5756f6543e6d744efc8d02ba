Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Figure 3c,d shows the calculated partial  electronic density of states (PDOS) and crystal models for bulk   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$   and   $\\mathrm{V_{Zn}â€“F e{\\cdot}Z n C o_{2}O_{4}}$  . Specifically, the valence band  (spreads over   ${\\approx}8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   range) and the lowest conduction band are  displayed. As shrinking energy difference between the   $\\mathrm{TM}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}$    and O 2p-band centers indicates an increased metalâ€“oxygen  covalency,  the Co 3d and O 2p centers are determined for   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$   and   $\\mathrm{V_{Zn}â€“F e{\\mathrm{-}}Z n C o_{2}O_{4}}$   by integrating the PDOS. Our  results (Table S5, Supporting Information) show that compared  with  $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$  , the   $\\mathrm{Co}\\;3\\mathrm{d}$   and O  $2\\mathrm{p}$   centers get closer in  $\\mathrm{V_{Zn}}$  -Fe $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$  , suggesting that the   $\\mathrm{V_{Zn}â€“F e{\\cdot}Z n C o_{2}O_{4}}$   oxide exhibits  greater   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$   covalency than   $\\mathrm{ZnCo_{2}O_{4}}$  . The enlarged   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$    covalency can promote the electron transfer between the TM  cation and oxygen adsorbates (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}{}^{2-},\\ \\mathrm{O}^{2-})$   or facilitate the  injection/extraction of electrons from oxygen, thereby accelerating the OER rate.  \n\na largely hydroxyl a ted surface (Figure S7, Supporting Information).  It is worth mentioning that the carbon additive (AB)  (e.g., carbon corrosion) is not likely to be responsible for such  current change because the background current from carbon is  rather negligible (Figure S8, Supporting Information).  \n\nA fundamental understanding on the substitution effects is  of paramount importance for screening and designing highly  efficient Co-containing spinel oxide catalysts for OER. The  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure S9,  Supporting Information) show that the various   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$  oxides are made up of irregularly shaped particles. The random  stacking of these irregularly shaped particles produced uniform  microscale   $(\\approx\\!25\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) pore structures observed in the scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure S10, Supporting Information) and BET results (Figure S11, Supporting Information).  The morphology is therefore not considered as an influencing  factor for the distinctive OER performance of   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$  oxides. The start-up step of one single OER cycle in alkaline  electrolyte involves the adsorption of   $\\mathrm{OH^{*}}$  . That is the hybridization between TM 3d orbitals and   $\\textsc{O}~2\\mathrm{p}$   orbitals of   $\\mathrm{OH^{*}}$  .  The Fe substituents, which are present as   $\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}\\ (t_{2g}{}^{3}e_{g}{}^{2})}$   in the  various   $\\mathrm{ZnFe}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{2-x}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$   oxides, bind the oxygen too weakly and  fail to activate the reactant.  We, therefore, assume that the  Co are the major active sites in those Co-containing spinel  \n\nIn addition to the influencing role of   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$   covalency  on the OER activity, the metalâ€“oxygen covalency was also  proposed to be a governor of the reaction mechanism.   With increasing metalâ€“oxygen covalency, the OER tends to  transfer from a concerted protonâ€“electron transfer pathway  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/6886ac0323ad2eaa62bd48993290d2515425433175ffbda5f7027865920271e0-1727118857.jpg)  \nFigure 3. â€‚ a) Molecular orbitals diagrams for the   $\\mathsf{C o-O H}\\ (\\mathsf{C o}^{3+},\\,\\mathsf{C o}^{4+})$   bonding at the surface of spinel oxides. b) The OER activity, evaluated by the  potentials at a current density of  $25~{\\upmu\\mathsf{A}}\\circ\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}{}_{0{\\upalpha}}$  , as a function of the  N - V  parameter.
