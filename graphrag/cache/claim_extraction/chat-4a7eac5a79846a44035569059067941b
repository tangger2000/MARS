The content focuses on the synthesis and characterization of perovskite materials, discussing the role of DPSI molecules in controlling grain growth and passivating defects in perovskite films, as well as the impact of DPSI concentration on device performance. There are no mentions of organizations, individuals, geographical locations, or events.<|>The precursor solution first yields a yellow inter medium phase containing residual solvent (such as dime thy form amide (DMF) or DMSO). The subsequent uncontrolled fast-drying and rapidcrystallization process under the thermal annealing could cause morphological defects, such as pinholes, and a broad grain size distribution. As illustrated in Figure 1a, we propose that the DPSI mole­ cules could attach on the surfaces of perovskite nucleus because of the strong coordination bonds between the DPSI and lead ions, and thereafter constrain the perovskite crystal growth and suppress the morphological defect formation during the pro­ cessing of the perovskite film. After the perovskite film forma­ tion, the DPSI molecules can neutralize the charged defects at the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite film using their positively and negatively charged components, as illus­ trated in Figure 1b. Figure 2 a,b shows the scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) images of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   films without and  with adding of   $0.05\\%$   DPSI molecules, respectively. The for­ mation of pinholes was greatly suppressed for the films with  DPSI in the precursor solution. The enlarged SEM images in  Figure 2c,d show that the films with DPSI possess much more  uniform grain size. The corresponding grain size distribution  is summarized in Figure 2e. The average grain size of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  film with   $0.05\\%$   DPSI is   ${\\approx}203\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}}$  , which is about   $48\\;\\mathrm{\\nm}$  smaller than that of the pristine   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   film, but the grain size  distribution is much narrower. It indicates that the DPSI mole­ cules retarded and well controlled each perovskite grain growth  to uniform size and eventually construct a compact perovskite  film. The grain size was further reduced, and some aggregation  appeared when the DPSI concentration increased to   $0.01\\%$  , as  shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). To explore the impact of the DPSI on the perovskite film  crystal structure, we collected X-ray diffraction (XRD) pat­ terns of the films with different DPSI concentrations and  calculated the peak intensity ratio between (110) and (312),  as shown in Figure 2f and in Figure S3 (Supporting Informa­ tion), respectively. The result shows that, with increasing of the  DPSI concentration to   $0.05\\%$  , the (110) peak intensity and the  ratio between the (110) and (312) peaks at 14.1 and 31.8 were  increased, which may arise from the grain orientation change. The   $\\mathsf{p-i-n}$   planar cell configuration used in this study was  structured as poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)amine]  (PTAA)/OIHPs/phenyl $\\cdot C_{61}$  -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/  ${\\sf C}_{60}/$  bath o cup roi ne (BCP)/copper   $(\\mathrm{Cu})$  . Considering that the  charge carrier extraction efficiency strongly depends on the  amount of the insulating molecules that introduced into  perov­ skite film, we first studied the effect of DPSI mole­ cule  concentration on the device performance.  Figure    3 a shows  the photo current curves of perovskite devices with different  amount of DPSI which were tuned by varying the concentra­ tion of DPSI in the   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   precursor solution. The control  device without DPSI showed typical performance with a shortcircuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$   of   $22.6\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.08\\;\\mathrm{V},$   a  fill factor (FF) of   $75.0\\%$  , and a PCE of   $18.4\\%$  . When the DPSI  concentration was increased to   $0.01\\%$   and   $0.05\\%$  , the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  was  significantly increased to 1.10 and   $1.12\\;\\mathrm{~V},$   respectively. The  best   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   devices were made by the precursor solution  with   $0.05\\%$   DPSI, exhibiting a significantly improved perfor­ mance with a   $J_{S C}$   of   $22.8\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.12~\\mathrm{V},$   an FF of   $79.0\\%$  , and a PCE of   $20.2\\%$  .
