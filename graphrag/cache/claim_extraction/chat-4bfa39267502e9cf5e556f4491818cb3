Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In particular, the  role of the representative chemical phase stabilizers, MAI, MABr,  and MACl, in the formation of the   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{FA}}\\mathrm{bl}_{3}$   phase is unclear,  and the mechanism by which these additives prevent the transformation of the cubic crystal phase to an amorphous structure  is unknown. Moreover, the use of MAI, MABr, and MACl is  expected to play a key role in the formation of pure   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   crystals, and for obtaining a stable   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$   phase. However, new  materials for use as chemical stabilizers must also be found.  \n\n# 2.4. 2D and Quasi-2D HMHP Solar Cells and their Device Stability  \n\nAs shown in the previous sections, the crystal phase transition  depends on the temperature and chemically dependent phase  stability of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  . In this section, we discuss the effect of crystallite orientation in HMHP thin films, and its effect on the stability of solar cells.  \n\nIt is possible to control the dimensionality of HMHP materials to prepare 0D, 1D, 2D (Ruddlesdenâ€“Popper (RP) phase), and  3D crystal structures, using different amounts of large organic  cations.  These different classes of materials are represented by  three traditional HMHP materials:  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  ,  as shown in  Figure Â  4 a.  Since the first reports of HMHP solar  cells, many researchers have tried to develop more efficient and  stable devices, and have focused on the improving the quality and  stability of the 3D structured HMHP solar cells. In contrast, one study on the application of a 2D HMHP to solar  cell devices was reported.  Generally, the orientation of the   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   crystal lites is slightly random, as shown by the broad diffraction rings in the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering  (GIWAXS) pattern in FigureÂ 4b. However, ordered 2D   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$  crystal structures are possible, as shown in the GIWAXS pattern  in FigureÂ 4c. The simulated 2D structure in FigureÂ 4d shows that  large organic cations can stack into a 3D   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   lattice. The  stacked large organic cations enhanced the phase sustainability  of local   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   grains by preventing ion migration.  Furthermore, this 2D structure had a remarkably high hydrophobic it y  on the surface of the HMHP thin film. This stability was tested  under exposure to constant illumination and humid conditions,  as shown in FigureÂ  4f. The maximum PCE of the 2D HMHP  solar cell was limited because of the wider optical bandgap compared with that of the classical 3D   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   crystal.  Subsequently, partial 2D structures, so-called quasi-2D HMHP solar  cells, were reported. This structure consists of 3D  $\\mathrm{Cs^{+}/F A^{+}}$   mixed  cations formed into   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   frameworks with partial substitution by  large organic cations, which yield the 3D HMHP structure. It was observed that the preferred orientation of the crystal lites  changes from part random and out-of-plane to highly out-ofplane with an increase in the inclusion of large organic cations,  as shown in FigureÂ 4e.  In tests of these HMHP materials for  solar cell applications, long-term stability in both nonencapsulated and encapsulated devices was observed.  \n\nHowever, the reasons why some crystal structures are  very stable under high humidity and temperature conditions  remain unclear. As shown in FigureÂ  4, the 2D or quasi-2D  structure of HMHP materials with   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   or   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   acts  to prevent ion migration between the grains in the solar cell  light absorber.  We suppose that the enhanced stability of  these solar cells can be due to the crystal lite orientation. Consequently, control of the crystal lite orientation based on the  crystal growth methods is a possible research topic for a range  of HMHP compositions. If the crystal functionality and properties can be controlled, the device and material stability issues  may be solved. However, the formation of defects, and the ion/ defect migration in bulk HMHP films, are unavoidable under  the operating conditions; we discuss how defects and ions are  generated in bulk HMHP films, in the next section.  \n\n# 3. Ion Migration and its Origins in HMHPs  \n\nIn SectionÂ 2, we reviewed how crystal phase transitions occur  and how the HMHP structures can be stabilized by chemical  additives such as organic-halide-induced pure   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  and 2D  and quasi-2D HMHP materials, which show better crystal  stability under illumination and in high humidity conditions.  However, these approaches do not entirely solve the instability  problem facing HMHP materials. In this section, we discuss  why stability remains a significant problem, as well as the  origin of instability.  \n\n# 3.1. Formation of Defects in HMHP Materials  \n\nYin etÂ  al.  reported intrinsic point defects, and Sargent  group  have also reported their low formation energies and  shallow transition energy levels; these defects, such as I interstitials   $\\mathrm{\\left({I}_{i}\\right)}$  , MA molecules on   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   sites   $\\left(\\mathrm{MA}_{\\mathrm{Pb}}\\right)$  , MA vacancies   $\\mathrm{(V_{MA})}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   vacancies   $(\\mathrm{V_{Pb}})$  , MA interstitial s (MA i ),   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atoms on  MA sites   $\\mathrm{(Pb_{MA})}$  , I vacancies   $\\mathrm{(V_{I})}$  , and MA molecules on I sites  (MA I ), are shown in  Figure Â  5 a. The defects with deep transition  levels are assigned to I atoms at MA sites   $\\mathrm{\\left(I_{MA}\\right)}$  , I atoms at   $\\mathrm{Pb}$    sites   $\\left(\\mathrm{I_{Pb}}\\right)$  ,   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   interstitial s   $\\mathrm{{(Pb}_{\\mathrm{i}})}$  , and   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atoms at I sites   $(\\mathrm{Pb_{I}})$    with high formation energies. Yin etÂ al. found that   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   has  predominantly shallow defects. A simulated atomic structure,  a supercell with two   $\\Sigma5(310)$   grain boundaries (GBs) with the  same structure as that in   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  , is shown in Figure\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
