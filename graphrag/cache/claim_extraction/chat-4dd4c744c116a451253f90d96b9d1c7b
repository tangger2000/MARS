Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The  J – V  curves are recorded with forward or reversed  voltage scanning directions. c)  $J^{-V}$  curves measured from five different spots with an aperture area of   $0.09\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{2}$   selected from the large area device  (active area of   $1.21\\,\\,{\\mathsf{c m}}^{2}$  ) as shown by the inset picture. All the  $J^{-V}$   curves were measured under standard AM 1.5G irradiation, with voltage step size  of   $10\\;\\mathsf{m V}$   and delay time of   $100\\;\\mathsf{m s}$  . d) stability data of devices aged under continuous AM 1.5 light soaking (short-circuit, temperature of  $\\mathsf{\\ddot{\\Pi}}{\\approx}25\\ \\mathrm{{}\\mathrm{{}\\circ}}\\mathsf{C}$   and   ${\\mathsf{R H}}<25\\%$  ) or in a dark oven with temperature of   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   (  $\\mathsf{R H}<25\\%)$  ).  \n\nin an excellent agreement with the measured   $J_{S C}$   values indicating that the spectral mismatch between our simulator and  the true  $\\mathrm{AM}~1.5$   solar emission is relatively small. With a fixed  bias of 0.91 V on the device, a stable photo current density of   $21.25\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$   was measured for the same large-area device  as shown in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information, corresponding to a   $19.34\\%$   stabilized PCE output near the maximum  power point. This result indicates that the PCEs obtained in forward and reverse scans at a routine scanning condition are near  the real performance.  \n\nWe also measured   $J{-}V$  curves with using small area metal  mask   $(0.3\\,\\mathrm{~cm}\\,\\times\\,0.3\\,\\mathrm{~cm})$  ) at five different positions located in  the center and at the four corners of the active area of a largesize device as shown in Figure 4c. Reducing the aperture mask  size from over 1 to   $0.09\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   increases the PCE from   $19.58\\%$  to   $20.40\\%$   despite of a   $42~\\mathrm{mV}$   loss in the open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$  . As reported, the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   loss arises from the increase in the  fraction of masked active area upon reducing the mask size. More importantly, all of these five curves were almost identical  and the value of   $J_{S C}$   shows very small variation, reflecting the  superior uniformity of the perovskite film over the square-centimeter scale at least.  \n\nOne of our large-size devices   $(1.025~\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   was tested by an  accredited PV (photovoltaic) test laboratory (AIST, Japan), which  certified a PCE of   $19.19\\%$   (Figure S5, Supporting Information).  As far as we know, this is the highest PCE for inverted structured PSCs with formal certification. We note that such high  PCE was achieved by using the simplest perovskite composition of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  . In consideration of many recently discovered  new perovskite compositions that have superior optical properties,  we believe that there is still significant room for performance enhancement of perovskite photovoltaics.  \n\nPreliminary stability investigations of the high-performance  devices have been conducted at both light- and thermally  accelerated aging conditions. As shown in Figure 4d, during a  continuous light soaking under simulated AM 1.5 irradiance,  the device can maintain  $90\\%$   of initial PCE after totally   $1000{\\mathrm{~h~}}$  illumination. The device also shows remarkable thermal stability with   $80\\%$   of their initial PCE after keeping in dark with  constant temperature of   $85\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $500\\,\\textrm{h}$  . This data show a  much improved result for the MA-based per ovsk ites, given  that MA-based per ovsk ites were frequently regarded as an  unstable component at elevated temperatures.  The degradation caused by composition loss should be closely related to the  dynamics and activation energy of ion migration in perovskite.  Previous studies have revealed that ion migration stimulated  by light, heat, and electrical field can be largely suppressed in  perovskite single crystal due to their smaller grain boundary  area and lower structural disorders and defects.  In our case,  the large crystals with high crystalline quality realized by the  additive engineering strategy are considered to be the most  important origin of the observed high device st abilities. The  unprecedented photo- and thermal stability exhibited by the  high-performing devices suggest a central role of the perovskite  crystallization quality in photovoltaic applications.  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated an additive engineering  strategy for conveniently fabricating large-area perovskite thin  films with high crystalline quality through a simple one-step  solution process without using any auxiliary operations, such  as anti solvent dripping or vacuum flash. The high crystalline  quality of perovskite is found to simultaneously enhance the  PCE and durability of PSCs. By using the simple and widely  used  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  , we achieved a certified PCE of   $19.19\\%$   for devices  with an aperture area of   $1.025~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  , and the high-performing  devices can remain  ${\\tt>}80\\%$  of the initial PCE after  $1000\\,\\mathrm{h}$   of light  soaking or   $500\\textrm{h}$   of thermal aging at   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . Both the obtained  photovoltaic performance and the thermal stability are among  the best results of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  -based PSCs today. Further utilization of our strategy to the upgraded perovskite compositions  with mixed cations and halides may result in even higher PCEs  and st abilities.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : All the chemicals were used as received, including nickel  acetyl ace to nate (  $\\mathcal{(}95\\%$  , Sigma–Aldrich),   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$     $(99\\%$  , Sigma–Aldrich), \n\n  $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{I}$     $(\\mathord{>}98\\%$  , Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Japan), th io semi carb azide \n\n  $(99\\%$  , Sigma–Aldrich),   $\\mathsf{P C}_{6}\\,\\mathsf{B M}$     $(99.5\\%$  , Lumtec Co., Taiwan), titanium  iso prop oxide   $(99.999\\%$  , Sigma–Aldrich), and niobium ethoxide   $(99.95\\%$  ,  Sigma–Aldrich).
