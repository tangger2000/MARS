Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The catalysts were coated onto the rotating disk electrode (RDE) tip  serving as the working electrode. LSV was performed using a Corrtest   $2350\\mathsf{H}$   electrochemical workstation and a Pine research instrument. The  ten-cycle CV scan between 1.1 and   $1.8~\\lor$   versus RHE at a scan speed  of   $50~\\mathsf{m V\\ s^{-1}}$   was performed to activate the electro catalyst. Before each  OER measurement, the electrolyte was purged with pure  $\\mathsf{O}_{2}$     $(99.9\\%)$   for  at least  $30\\;\\mathsf{m i n}$  . To evaluate the OER activity, the LSV curves were carried  at a scan rate of   $10\\ m\\lor\\mathsf{s}^{-1}$   and a rotating speed of   $2500\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$  . The Tafel  slope was obtained by applying the LSV scan at the rates of   $1\\textsf{m V s}^{-1}$  .  The over potential was iR-corrected using Equation (2):  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{E\\,{=}\\,E\\,(a p p l i e d\\ p o t e n t i a l\\,v e r s u s\\,R H E)\\,{-}\\,i R}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $i$  indicates the current, and   $R$   is the ohmic resistance of the  electrolyte   $\\scriptstyle(\\approx5\\ \\Omega$   for   $]\\texttt{M}$   KOH,   ${\\approx}45~\\Omega$   for   $0.1\\;\\textsf{M}\\;\\mathsf{K O H})$  . The EIS were  measured using a Corrtest   $2350\\mathsf{H}$   electrochemical workstation with a  frequency range from  $10^{6}$   to  $\\mathsf{I}0^{-1}\\,\\mathsf{H}z$  . The stability was examined using the  chrono potenti ome try method and two-electrode mode in   $]\\textsf{M}\\mathsf{K O H}$  . The  catalyst was deposited on Ni foil with a quantity density of   $2\\ \\mathsf{m g}\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  .  The commercial   $20~\\mathsf{w t\\%}$   Pt/C was used as the electrode for hydrogen  evolution reactions.  \n\nThe double-layer capacitance s   $(C_{\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{l}})$   of different catalysts were  calculated by the CV scans within a voltage range between 1.13 and   $1.23~\\lor$   versus RHE. In this region, there was no contribution from the  Faradaic current. The CV measurement at various scan rates from 5 to   $100\\ m\\lor s^{-1}$   was applied.   $(j_{a}-j_{c})/2$   versus the scan rate plot was applied  for all the samples for the calculation of the slope.  \n\nIn this work, the TOF of catalysts with different structural entropies  was calculated using Equation (3):  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{T O F}=\\frac{j s}{4n F}\n$$  \n\nwhere  $j$   is the measured current density,  s  is the electrode area, F is the  Faraday constant, and   $n$   is the molar number of the active sites both on  the surface and in bulk. It was assumed that all transition metals (Fe,  Co, Mn, Ni) represent the reactive site.  \n\nComputation Study : The effect of structural entropy on intrinsic  activity for OER was investigated by DFT. All computational calculations  were performed with projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo potentials  using the Perdew–Burke–Enrnzerhof (PBE) functional in the Vienna  Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). A kinetic energy cutoff of   $500~\\mathrm{eV}$    was set for the plane waves. Bulk models of   $\\mathsf{L a}_{0.6}\\mathsf{S r}_{0.4}\\mathsf{C o}_{0.2}\\mathsf{M n}_{0.8}\\mathsf{O}_{3},$  ,   $\\mathsf{L a}_{0.6}\\mathsf{S r}_{0.4}\\mathsf{C o}_{0.2}(\\mathsf{F e M n N i})_{0.8}\\mathsf{O}_{3},$  ,  and   $\\mathsf{L a}_{0.6}\\mathsf{S r}_{0.4}\\mathsf{C o}_{0.2}(\\mathsf{F e M n N i M g})_{0.8}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$    with cubical structure were built for optimizing lattice geometries.  To accommodate Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, and   $\\mathsf{M g}$   atoms on the B-site of the  perovskite structure, each unit cell contained 80 atoms in total. There  was no significant difference in atomic size or electronegativity among  the five constituent elements on the B-site. Therefore, they showed a  highly homogeneous distribution.  Accordingly, a uniform chemical  composition distribution was adopted in bulk models. The first  Brillouin zone of unit cells was sampled with a   $2\\times2\\times2\\ k$  -point grid  during optimizing lattice parameters. Slab models of binary and HEOs  were built from optimized bulk models to investigate oxygen vacancy  formation and OER on the surface. As transitional metals on the B-site  usually act as active sites for OER,  slab models with  $\\mathsf{C o\\mathrm{-}M n\\mathrm{-}O}$   and   $\\mathsf{C o-F e-M n-N i-M g-O}$   terminations were established for binary and  HEOs, respectively. The slab models contain five layers with two bottom  layers fixed and three top layers fully relaxed. A 15 Å-thick vacuum layer  was added in the   $Z$  -direction. Monkhorst-Pack  $2\\times2\\times\\mathsf{I}$    k -point meshes  were used for sampling slab models. Both AEM and LOM for OER were  taken into consideration. The Hubbard U correction was adopted to  describe the strongly correlated electronic states. The effective U values  were taken from literature,  where effective coulombic interaction  in transition metals was calculated from constrained random-phase  approximation. The Gibbs energies of slab models with adsorbed  intermediates were corrected by zero-point energy and entropy. The force  and energy convergence criteria were set to   $0.{\\bar{0}}3\\ \\mathsf{e V}\\ \\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{-1}$   and   $10^{-5}$   e Å,  respectively.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nL.T. and Y.Y. contributed equally to this work.
