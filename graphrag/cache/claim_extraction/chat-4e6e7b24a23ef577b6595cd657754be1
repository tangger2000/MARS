Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we synthesized homogeneously mixed high entropy  perovskite cobaltate oxide electro catalyst   $(\\mathrm{La_{0.6}S r_{0.4}C o_{0.2}F e_{0.2}M n_{0.2}}$   $\\mathrm{Ni_{0.2}M g_{0.2}O_{3}}$   through a simple sol-gel method. Comprehensive  X-ray spectroscopic characterization indicates the evolution of  the charge state among multiple B-site cations and the alternation of the electronic configuration of oxygen ion, which collec- tively facilitate the promotion of intrinsic OER activity. Combined  with experimental and computational efforts, we have demonstrated that the configuration entropy could serve as an effective tool to ease the formation of oxygen vacancies, drastically  strengthening the OER reaction on electro catalyst via the LOM  pathway. Notably, such entropy-induced enhancement of OER  performance may also be tuned by the elemental composition in  both A and B-sites, as the cations with different ionic radii and  charges will lead to different degrees of lattice distortion. At this  stage, our work opens a new dimension and broad compositional  space for the rational design of highly efficient oxide catalysts. In  the next step, the detailed and systematic high-throughput computation and machine learning methods could further contribute  to screening, predicting, and discovering more stable and reactive oxide platforms applicable for diverse catalysis processes.  \n\n# 4.

Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), citric acid, potassium  hydroxide (KOH,  ${\\geq}95\\%$  ), and   $\\mathsf{I r O}_{2}$     $(99.9\\%)$   were purchased from Macklin.  \n\nMaterial Synthesis : All samples with different structural entropies were  prepared by a modified sol â gel method. Typically, a stoic hio metric amount  of metal salts was mixed in a beaker and completely dissolved by using   $30~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   deionized (DI) water. The EDTA and citric acid were slowly poured  into the dissolved solution with the molar ratio of metal ions /EDTA/citric  acid being 1:1:1. After completely dissolving, the  $\\mathsf{N H}_{3}$     $\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$   was applied to  adjust the   $\\mathsf{p H}$   of the solution to 8. And then, the as-prepared liquid was  magnetically stirred at the temperature of   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   to evaporate the water  and form a gel. The as-formed gel was put in an oven at  $170~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\mathsf{T}2\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathsf{h}$    and annealed at  $850~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $3\\;\\mathsf{h}$   to form the electro catalyst powder.  \n\nStructural Characterization : The XRD patterns were collected by an  Ultima IV power diffract o meter (Rigaku Corporation, Japan) with the  Cu  $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$   radiation   $(\\lambda=0.15406~\\mathsf{n m})$  ). The Rietveld refinement analysis was  performed by using the EXPGUI GSAS software. The Raman spectroscopy  experiment was performed in XploRA PLUS Raman spectrometer  (HORIBA, France). The excitation source was a HeNe laser   $(638\\;\\mathsf{n m})$  ). The  BrunauerâEmmettâTeller (BET) specific surface areas were measured on an  ASAP 2020 instrument. A SUPRA 55 field emission SEM and a Philips-FEI  Tecnai F30 TEM equipped with energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy  (EDX) were collectively employed to analyze the surface composition and  particle morphology. The FTIR spectroscopy was conducted on a Nicolet  Is5 instrument. The Thermo Scientific K-Alpha instrument (Al K Î±  radiation   $\\c=1486.6$  Â  eV) was employed to perform the XPS analysis. The binding  energy of C 1s   $(284.8\\,\\mathsf{e V})$   was utilized for the calibration of all XPS spectra.  The O K-edge, Co L-edge, and Mn L-edge XANES were obtained at the  Beamlines MCD-A and MCD-B (Soochow Beamline for Energy Materials)  at National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL, China) under a  total electron yield mode. UVâvis absorption spectra experiments were  conducted on a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Agilent, Japan) with the  measurement region from 200 to  $800\\;\\mathsf{n m}$  .  \n\nElectrochemical Measurements : Before depositing the electro catalyst,  the electrode was carefully washed and polished to remove all debris  and dirt.  $10\\;\\mathsf{m g}$  Â of electro catalyst and  $2\\:\\mathsf{m g}$   of acetylene black were mixed  well, and the mixture was dispersed in   $\\mathsf{I}~\\mathsf{m L}$   hybrid solvent containing   $0.50\\ \\mathrm{\\mL}$   ultrapure water,   $0.47\\ \\mathrm{mL}$   ethanol anhydrous, and   $0.03\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$     $5\\mathrm{wt\\%}$  Â Nafion. The as-formed ink was ultrasonically dispersed for  $\\sf_{\\tau n}$  in  an iced bath. The   $10~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   of ink was dropped onto a glassy carbon (GC)  electrode with an exposed area of   $0.196\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{2}$  , and then the electrode was  naturally dried at  $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   until completely dry.  \n\nApplying a three-electrode mode with   ${\\mathsf{H g O/H g}}$   and carbon rod as  reference and counter electrode, respectively, the OER tests were carried  out. The catalysts were coated onto the rotating disk electrode (RDE) tip  serving as the working electrode. LSV was performed using a Corrtest   $2350\\mathsf{H}$   electrochemical workstation and a Pine research instrument. The  ten-cycle CV scan between 1.1 and   $1.8~\\lor$   versus RHE at a scan speed  of   $50~\\mathsf{m V\\ s^{-1}}$   was performed to activate the electro catalyst. Before each  OER measurement, the electrolyte was purged with pure  $\\mathsf{O}_{2}$     $(99.9\\%)$   for  at least  $30\\;\\mathsf{m i n}$  .
