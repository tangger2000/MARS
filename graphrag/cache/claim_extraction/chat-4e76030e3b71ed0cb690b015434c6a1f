For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized.

Regarding the emissive properties of QD films, although long  organic ligands perfectly passivated the  QD’s surface and endowed ink with the  near-unity luminescent properties with a  PLQY approaching   $100\\%$  ,  the films  generally exhibited a relatively low PLQY  of about   $40\\%$   due to the formation of  non radiative recombination centers. This  phenomenon results from the dynamic  characteristic of the bonding between the  QD’s surface and organic capping ligands,  leading to the mismatched ligands during  the film-forming process.  Meanwhile,  these ligands act as electrically insulating  layers on the QD’s surface resulting in  inefficient carrier injection and transportation,  which are detrimental to device  \n\nPerovskite quantum dots (QDs) with high photo luminescence quantum yields  (PLQYs) and narrow emission peak hold promise for next-generation flexible and  high-definition displays. However, perovskite QD films often suffer from low  PLQYs due to the dynamic characteristics between the QD’s surface and organic  ligands and inefficient electrical transportation resulting from long hydrocarbon  organic ligands as highly insulating barrier, which impair the ensuing device  performance. Here, a general organic–inorganic hybrid ligand (OIHL) strategy  is reported on to passivate perovskite QDs for highly efficient electro lu minescent devices. Films based on QDs through OIHLs exhibit enhanced radiative  recombination and effective electrical transportation properties compared to  the primal QDs. After the OIHL pass iv ation, QD-based light-emitting diodes  (QLEDs) exhibit a maximum peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of   $16.48\\%,$  ,  which is the most efficient electro luminescent device in the field of perovskitebased LEDs up to date. The proposed OIHL pass iv ation strategy positions  perovskite QDs as an extremely promising prospect in future applications of  high-definition displays, high-quality lightings, as well as solar cells.  \n\nPerovskite quantum dots (QDs) possess unique size, composition, and shape tunable optical and electrical properties and  are considered building blocks for various low-cost, solutionprocess able electronic and op to electronic devices,  including  solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and photodetector s.  High photo luminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to   $95\\%$   and narrow light-emitting peak with full width at half  maximum (FWHM) of about   $20~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   make them a particularly  attractive option for next-generation flexible and high-definition  displays.  Perovskite-QD-based light-emitting diodes (QLEDs)  have presently demonstrated an external quantum efficiency  (EQE) of up to   $9\\%$  .  Yet in contrast to perovskite film–based  LEDs with an EQE of   $14.35\\%$  ,  QLED performance remains  comparatively poor.  \n\nperformance. To enhance the electric properties of QD films,  much attention  has been devoted to the development of  ligand strategies that minimize the inter particle spacing. For  example, Li et  al. demonstrated an effective enhancement in  electrical properties and EQE of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QLEDs through the  control of surface ligand density.  Through ligand-exchange  strategies,  a relatively short (C12) ligand, didodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB), was used to enhance device  performance, obtaining an EQE of   $8.73\\%$   under an effective  washing process. Unfortunately, these methods are still based  on long organic ligands, which cannot render the QD solid  with ideal carrier injection and transportation features. Thus, it  is significantly crucial to find an effective and feasible strategy  to control the surface state of perovskite QDs, which could  guarantee the high exciton recombination and carrier injection in constructing high-performance electro luminescent (EL)  devices.  \n\nInorganic ligands with less space separation among particles  could effectively enhance the electrical properties of QD  films.  Meanwhile, they also improved the PL features  through the reduce of the defect-related non radiative recombination, which has been proven in traditional QDs.  For  example, the halide-related ligands have improved the luminescent feature and radiative recombination in Cd-based QDs,  which was realized by the ligand-exchange process.  But  such a strategy is not feasible for perovskite QDs because they  are more ionic in nature and easily damaged in solvents, which bring extraordinary challenges when they are passivated by using inorganic ligands. Recently, a few reports demonstrated that perovskite QD solution and films exhibited  enhanced emissive properties through the treatment of inorganic materials, such as   $\\mathrm{NH_{4}S C N}$  ,   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  , and   $\\mathrm{{NH}_{4}\\mathrm{{Br}.}}$   These  results revealed that introducing applicable inorganic-based  short ligands was expected to achieve high electro-optic conversion efficiency in LEDs.  \n\nIn this work, we develop an organic–inorganic hybrid ligand  (OIHL) strategy to passivate perovskite QDs for controlling the  surface state and then constructing highly efficient QLEDs. The  hybrid ligands adhered to the QD surface evidenced by infrared  (IR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The  remaining organic ligands enable the QDs with high colloidal  ink stabilization for preparing the high-quality films. The introduced metal bromide inorganic ligands could enhance the  luminescent features and effective carrier injection originated  from increase of radiative recombination, and their intrinsic  high conductivity. Thus, simultaneously conductive and bright  QD-emitting layers make QLEDs with a peak EQE of   $15.4\\%$  ,  which is the highest efficiency among perovskite-based LEDs  reported thus far. Furthermore, we verified that other metal  bromides, including   $\\mathrm{MnBr}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{GBaBr}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{InBr}_{3}$  , were generalized and could be used to passivate perovskite QDs through  the proposed OIHL strategy for highly efficient QLEDs with  an   ${\\approx}40\\%$   improvement. The novel pass iv ation strategy for  enhanced device performance makes perovskite QDs extremely  promising in future practical applications.  \n\nThe OIHL pass iv ation of perovskite QDs to control the surface state is presented in  Figure   1 a. The   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD emitters  were synthesized through a previous report  with some slight  modifications (see the “Experimental Section”).
