Due to the less bound atomic orbitals of Sn that form the bands, both the edges of CB and VB are less bound in Sn-based perovskite relative to Pb-based analogs. This indicates that the Sn-derived valence band maximum (VBM) and Pb-derived conduction band minimum (CBM) delimit the range of the bandgap of the alloy.
