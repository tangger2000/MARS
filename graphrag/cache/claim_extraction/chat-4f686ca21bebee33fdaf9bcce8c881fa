Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The ability of DMF to fully dissolve these components is essential for the subsequent controlled crystallization process when this solution is mixed with a poor solvent.

However, in the cases of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs  after calcination at   $300\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ,   $\\mathrm{Ti-O-C}$   peak disappears, which  suggests the hydrolysis and condensation of titanium precursor  to form a   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   layer. In addition, following TBOT hydrolysis  there is an increase in the peak intensity of surface-adsorbed  water   $(\\mathrm{H{-}O{-}H})$  , hydroxyl groups   $\\mathrm{(O-H)}$  , and Ti  O  Ti bonds  at 3430, 1630, and   $500~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , respectively, which indicates the  coating of titanium matrix on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs (i.e.,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   composite).  The significant decrease of the surfaceadsorbed water, hydroxyl groups, and organic species (2923 and   $2854~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ) of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs after calcination s at   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    suggests the loss of water, carbonaceous residues, and dehyd roxy la tion process occur during calcination which is in good  agreement with the TGA analysis.  \n\nThe XRD patterns of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$   com- posite, and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs are shown in Figure 2c.  Although the standard pattern of cubic phase   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   mostly  overlaps with that of ortho rhombi c phase, the XRD pattern  confirms the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs exhibit an ortho rhombi c phase,  evidenced by the split diffraction peak at   ${\\approx}30^{\\circ}$   (Figure S6, Supporting Information).  For   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$   composite calcined  below   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , the XRD pattern is the same as an ortho rhombi c   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   phase without   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   peaks due to the amorphous phase  of surface   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}.$  . For   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs calcinated at   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ,  two weak diffraction peaks of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   can be observed (marked  with an asterisk in Figure 2c) in addition to the XRD peaks  of ortho rhombi c   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   phase, indicating the formation of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell on the surface of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs. The low intensity  of the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   XRD peaks relative to those of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   core NCs  might indicate either thin   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell or incomplete crystal lization of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   with possible amorphous components.  As the  calcination was performed under argon, the lack of oxygen in  the annealing atmosphere lead to an incomplete combustion  of carbon and organic residues on the surface of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   NCs,  which is portrayed by the dark color of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   powder after calcination (Figure 1a). Moreover, the XRD  pattern of pure   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   samples after calcination also shows a  broad carbon diffraction peak (Figure S4, Supporting Information), which is in agreement with the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs (discussed below in  Figure 5a).  \n\nThe survey XPS spectrum (Figure 2d) and high-resolution  XPS (Figure S7, Supporting Information) of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    NCs show distinct peaks of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d, which  have binding energy positions similar to the literature.   However, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$   core/shell composite shows a  decreased intensity of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d peaks compared  to the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs (Figure 2d), suggesting that the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    NCs were encapsulated by   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  shell. In addition, it could be  observed that the XPS survey spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs also  contained Ti and O elements.
