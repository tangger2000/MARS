Compared with the control ﬁlm, the modiﬁed sample was stacked more compactly (Figure  5e,f ) and had a smoother surface (Figure S11 , Supporting Information). The grains within the modiﬁed perovskite ﬁlm spanned the entire thickness of the ﬁlm, whereas the cross-section of the control ﬁlm consisted of smaller grains (Figure  5g,h , Supporting Information). These enhancements in grain size, compactness, and smoothness can be attributed to the suppression of heterogeneous nucleation. The ameliorated morphology was expected to facilitate eﬃcient carrier transport and reduce non radiative charge recombination.  \n\nThe crystal structure and crystal lin it y of the perovskite layer were evaluated through X-ray diﬀraction (XRD). The diﬀraction peak positions in the modiﬁed perovskite ﬁlms remained unchanged in comparison with the control ﬁlms (Figure  5i ). The diﬀraction peak intensity was slightly enhanced after the modiﬁcation of DLCH, which is due to increased grain size and improved morphology. The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) exhibited comparable crystal lin it y and orientation between the control and modiﬁed perovskite ﬁlms regardless of the incidence angle of  $0.15^{\\circ}$   or   $0.2^{\\circ}$   (Figure  S12 , Supporting Information). We conducted depth-dependent grazing incidence X-ray diﬀraction (GIXRD) measurements to investigate the stress distribution within both the control and modiﬁed perovskite ﬁlms. The presence of residual stress and strain, often arising from lattice distortion, has been extensively shown to have adverse eﬀects on both eﬃciency and stability. ]   To assess residual stress and strain, we further investigated the diﬀraction peak of the (211) crystal plane, due to its high diﬀraction angle and the presence of a multiplicative factor that provides more precise structural symmetry information.

This suggests that the electron extraction was accelerated after DLCH modulation. The charge extraction and transfer process is further studied by transient photo current (TPC). Compared with the control device   $(3.68\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$  , the modiﬁed device (1.21  μ s) exhibited a faster carrier decay lifetime (Figure  7c ). In addition, we investigated the carrier recombination kinetics using the transient photo voltage (TPV) curves of PSCs with and without DLCH modi cation (Figure  7d ). The carrier decay lifetime was increased from  $25.03~\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   for the unmodiﬁed device to  $31.01\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   for DLCH-modiﬁed device, demonstrating that the trapassisted non radiative recombination was much suppressed after  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/d2f36b6148a820175ca52b4bad438a86d5ca40ef8f4466e616ce4fc5eb74dcd3-1727106152.jpg)  \nFigure 7.  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ﬁlm substrates. c) TPC and d) TPV curves of the control and modiﬁed PSCs. e)  $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   as a function of light intensities for the control and modiﬁed devices. f) Mott–Schottky analysis at  $1000\\,{\\mathsf{H}}z$   of the devices based on bare  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   modiﬁed by DLCH.
