For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized.

Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicates  quite similar crystal lin it y and texture of perovskite crystals  with and without molecules (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Similar observation was recently reported by Yang and  co-workers  Therefore, we conclude that the molecules have  little influence on the internal crystal structure and crystal lin it y  of grains but that these molecules are indeed decorating GBs  throughout the depth of the films.  \n\nHaving confirmed molecular decoration at GBs within the  bulk film, we seek to investigate the op to electronic properties  of perovskite films to gain insight into the pass iv ation mechanism with different molecular treatments. We confirm that the  absorption spectra of the control and passivated films are nearly  identical in all cases (Figure S7, Supporting Information), indicating negligible contribution to potential changes of device  performance. It has been demonstrated that the introduction of  semiconductors ensures PL quenching due to charge transfer  at the perovskite/semiconductor interface.  Notably then,  Figure 3a shows PL quenching of   $30\\%$  ,   $65\\%$  ,   $48\\%$  , and   $91\\%$    for PCBM, ITIC, DTS, and DR3T passivated films with respect  to the control one, respectively.

The fast, slow, and average lifetime   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ave}})$   was calculated and listed in Table S3 (Supporting  Information).

These  results thus strongly indicate that the GB pass iv ation with shallower trap states results in better charge separation and charge  extraction to the electrode.  \n\nElectrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) provides insight  into the charge transport process and contact resistance information.

We collected the dark current–voltage characteristics for both electron-only and hole-only devices (see Figure  S9 in the Supporting Information for device architectures).   Figure   $_{3\\mathrm{g}}$   illustrates the dark current–voltage characteristics  of the representative ITIC passivated device, which indicates a  linear ohmic response at the low bias   $_{(<0.17\\mathrm{~V~})}$  , a trap-filling  regime (0.18 to 0.6 V) and a trap-free space charge limit current  (SCLC) regime   $_{(>0.6\\mathrm{~V~})}$  . The trap state density was determined  by the trap-filled limit voltage using the following equation  \n\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}{q L^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity,   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   is the relative dielectric constant,   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit  region,   $q$   is the elemental charge, and   $L$   is the thickness of the  film. We found that the trap densities significantly decrease  from   $3.19\\,\\times\\,10^{16}$   to   $1.10\\,\\times\\,10^{16}$  ,   $5.9\\,\\times\\,10^{\\bar{15}}$  ,   $1.01\\,\\times\\,10^{16}$  , and   $7.4\\times10^{15}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   for the control, PCBM, ITIC, DTS, and DR3T  passivated devices (Figure 3h), respectively. These results prove  that molecular pass iv ation at GBs remediates defects in the  perovskite film, which is expected to diminish charge recombination and account for increased   $F F$   in the corresponding  solar cells. Interestingly, ITIC and DR3T molecules still behave  better than PCBM and DTS ones for diminishing the trap  densities.  \n\nThe intrinsic electron and hole mobilities were estimated using the SCLC method and the values are shown in  Figure 3i.  The electron and hole mobilities are found to be  0.38 and   $0.65\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{\\V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{\\s}^{-1}$  , respectively, for the control film.
