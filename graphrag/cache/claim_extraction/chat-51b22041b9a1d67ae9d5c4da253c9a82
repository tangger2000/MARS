Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Additionally, after five months, the QY of these two samples decreased  greatly, to only   $55\\%$   and   $26\\%$   of their initial values (FigureÂ 4b;  Figure S13, Supporting Information). The decrease of QY was  also revealed by the images under UV lamp, and OA-capped  QDs exhibited better stability than OAm-capped QDs.  \n\nIn contrast to these disappointing findings, DBSA-capped  QDs exhibited robust storage stability. Though the room temperature varied from 30 to  $-6\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and the moisture changed from   $20\\%$   to   $80\\%$  , the colloidal solution remained clear and transparent without any protection, as shown in FigureÂ  4a. Strong  green emission comparable to the initial performance under  UV light was observed, and this was also confirmed by PL QY  measurement (FigureÂ 4b). After five months, the emission wavelength of DBSA-capped QDs remained stable, and the PL curves  were nearly the same (Figure S12, Supporting Information).  \n\nIt has been frequently reported that QD size will increase  along with the redshift of emission peak wavelength and deterioration of QY under light illumination.  The OAm-QDs  exhibited similar behavior under ultrahigh laser light flux  (  $(405\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ,   $820\\,\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}}$  ,  Figure Â   5 a; Figure S14, Supporting  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/04ff73df6c145c1fe7f45b0bf0a205094a112fdf808f85697bf51cc5b88833ef-1727124207.jpg)  \nFigure 5. â Optical and thermal st abilities of the QD films. a) Peak wavelength and b) PL intensity of OAm- and DBSA-QDs under a high laser light   $(405~\\mathsf{n m})$   flux of   $820\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  . c) Peak wavelength and d) PL intensity of OAm- and DBSA-QDs after annealing at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .  \n\nInformation). The emission wavelength redshifted from 515.4  to   $521~\\mathrm{nm}$   after illumination of   $400\\ \\mathrm{min}$  , and only   $58\\%$   of the  initial QY was maintained. However, the DBSA-QDs showed  stable peak wavelength, even under such a high light intensity  (FigureÂ 5b). This is totally different from previous results and  indicates stable QD size during treatment. Additionally,   $68\\%$   of  the initial QY was achieved, higher than that of OAm-QDs.  \n\nTo further confirm the enhanced stability of DBSA-QDs,  the thermal stability of thin films was evaluated. The DBSAQD film maintained the emission peak wavelength and exhibited high PL intensity endurance   $(89\\%)$   after treatment at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $150~\\mathrm{{h}}$   (FigureÂ 5c,d). In contrast, the emission wave- length of OAm-QDs changed from 515.4 to   $523.4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , and  only   $23\\%$   of the initial PL intensity was maintained. These  results again manifest the strong binding effect of the  sulfonate groups on the QD surface and suggest potential  applications in future op to electronic devices. To date, many  surface pass iv ation strategies have been proposed to simultaneously improve the QY and stability. One strategy is to  directly passivate QDs during synthesis with different ligand  system (Table S2, Supporting Information). Another strategy  is the post-treatment of QDs with various agents (Table S3,  Supporting Information). Despite attempts to apply these  strategies, there are few reports of increased stability of  perovskite QDs with maintenance of high PL QY. The complete purification of perovskite QDs still remains challenging.  DBSA-QDs not only possess high QY, but also can be purified completely and exhibit good resistance against light  irradiation and heat treatment, indicating their potential  applications in op to electronic devices.  \n\nIn conclusion, in this work, we developed a new ligand  strategy and overcame the purification and storage problems  successfully. The elimination of non radiative recombination  is fulfilled by an equivalent ligand by raising the orbit energy  of exposed   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atoms. Both the theoretical and experimental  results are consistent with this model. The equivalent ligands  not only solve the luminescence efficiency issue due to   $V_{\\mathrm{Br}}$  but also contribute to a strong interaction between ligands  and the QD surface, as shown by the relatively low diffusion  coefficient and good stability.   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs capped by the  equivalent ligand show QY above  $90\\%$  , stable emission peaks,  good long-term storage stability, and robust high-energy irradiation stability, even after five washes. This work will not  only promote the investigation of perovskite QDs in optoelectronic devices, but also facilitate efforts to modify single  particle core-shell structures with multiple functions and  applications.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis of   $\\mathcal{I},4\\cdot D B S A\\cdot C s P b B r_{3}$   QDs :   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$     $(0.0593\\mathrm{~g},\\,0.182\\mathrm{~}\\mathsf{m}\\mathsf{m}\\mathsf{o}\\mathsf{L})$  ,   $\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{O A c})_{2}$     $(0.206\\mathrm{~g},\\;0.54\\mathrm{~}\\mathsf{m}\\mathsf{m}\\mathsf{o}\\mathsf{L})$  ), ODE   $(10\\,\\mathrm{\\textmuL})$  , and dodecyl benzene  sulfonic acid (  $\\mathsf{I.2045~g,3.689~m m o l}$  L) were loaded into a   $100~\\mathsf{m L}$   threeneck flask and the mixture was degassed for half an hour at   $120~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  under Ar flow.
