Studies have reported that \n\n  $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$   serves as a secondary supply of the catalytic ally active \n\n  $\\mathrm{Mn^{3+}}$  .  The presence of Fe provides charge stability to prevent the formation of a side oxide phase, which inhibits the  formation of active sites, leading to a lower OER activity.   Moreover, the adjacent   ${\\cal C}{\\o}^{3+}$   ions can be effectively activated  by   $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$   due to both the spin and charge effect, resulting in  increased intrinsic catalytic activity.  With regard to Co, Cobased perovskite oxides exhibit terrific OER performance due  to the   $\\mathrm{COO}_{6}$   octahedron.  High oxidation states were  found to be favorable for better catalytic activity.  A metal  with high oxidation states is more likely to accept an electron  from   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  . As a result, bearing in mind that   $\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$   ratio  is the highest in each of the 5 samples (Table S2, Supporting  Information),  Figure   5 a shows that, for these 5 HEPO samples,  the over potential decreases with the   $\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$   ratio. In other  words, Co dominates the catalytic activity. DFT calculation indicates that Co-doping can lower the OER over potential with the   ${C0}^{3+}$   sites being more effective than Ni and Fe cations.  However, while Co dominates the activity, the interplays with other  factors cannot be ignored, especially, the existence of   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$   and  oxygen vacancy   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{o}}\\right)$  . Of note here is that the   $\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$  ratio is  low in L5M2Ni; however, following the argument for the other  5 HEPO samples, it shows a higher than expected overpotential (Figure  5a). The existence of   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$   is therefore  considered. As mentioned above,   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$   serves as a secondary  supply of the catalytic ally active   $\\mathrm{Mn}^{3+}$  . It has been shown that  OER over potential progressively decreases with   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$  .  In-situ  analysis even suggests   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$   dictates OER activity.  Thus, the  lowest OER over potential was reported to be often in between   $\\mathrm{Mn}^{3.5+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Mn^{3.7+}}$  .

Table S2, Supporting  Information, also shows that the L5M2Ni sample has the  highest amount of   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$  . Oxygen vacancies have been found to  tune the electronic structure, providing a significant catalytic  performance improvement for perovskite oxide electro catalysts.  Abundant oxygen vacancies promote the adsorption of adsorbates, thus considerably accelerating the OER kinetics.   With the a distinct   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}/M n^{3+}}$   ratio of 1.55 and the highest  amount of   $V_{\\mathrm{o}},$  , the OER activity of L5M2Ni shown in Figure 5a  is explained. In fact, considering the effects of   $\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}/}$   $\\mathrm{Mn}^{3+}$  , and   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$  , the OER activity is justified since the overpotential of all the HEPOs follows the same trend (Figure S14,  Supporting Information). To further explain the OER catalytic  activity, DFT calculations were performed. We first found that   $^{*}\\mathrm{O}$   is stable but   $^{\\ast}\\mathrm{OO}$   is unstable. In other words, it is the AEM  that dominates the OER but not the lattice oxygen mechanism \n\n (LOM). Based on the AEM, the reaction of   $_\\mathrm{M-O^{\\ast_{+}}}$     $\\mathrm{OH^{-}\\ \\rightarrow}$   \n\n  $_{\\mathrm{M-OOH^{*}+e^{-}}}$   is take to be the rate determining step. In the  calculation, Mn was taken as the active site (Figure S15a,b, Supporting Information). The optimized structures having   $^{*}\\mathrm{O}$   and   $^{\\ast}\\mathrm{OOH}$   absorbed on the surface-active sites are shown in Figure  S15c, Supporting Information.
