Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim.

ZnO Quantum Dots  \n\nCompared with other   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nano structures, ZnO QDs show  many unique properties. First, due to its small size, the quasi  continuous energy levels of bulk materials are replaced by  the separated electronic energy levels and the band gap will  become larger. The increased band gap is mainly caused by  the negative shift of the conduction band and the positive shift  of the valence band, which will improve the electron injection  efficiency. Second, after absorbing a photon, QDs can produce  more than one exciton, which is beneficial to improve the performance of solar cells.  \n\nAmeen et al. fabricated a flexible planar PSC based on \n\n  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   quantum dots for the first time.

After   $2\\textrm{h}$   of reaction, the  obtained solution was centrifuged and dispersed for several  times, and the finally obtained ZnO QDs were dispersed in  ethanol. To fabricate   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   QDs based PSCs, the graphene film, \n\n  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   QDs film, and perovskite film were deposited on ITO-PET \n\n (polyethylene terephthalate) substrate sequentially.

Obviously, the introduction of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   QDs and APjet  treatment obviously improved the performance of PSC. The  main reason is that the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   QDs film can provide a larger  contact area than compact graphene film and the APjet treatment improved the porosity and surface area of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   QDs  film, which significantly increased the light scattering and the  interaction between the  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   film and  $\\mathrm{Zno-QDS}$   interfaces,  leading to an improved  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  . In addition, the PSC based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$    QDs with APjet treatment shows a higher electron transport  and charge collection, which results in a high   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$  . As a  result, the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   QDs and APjet treatment are essential for high  performance PSC.  \n\nHowever, large specific surface area and large amount of surface atoms of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   QDs lead to the lack of coordination of surface atoms and increase of unsaturated bonds. As a result, these  surface atoms are high activity and extremely unstable, which  are very easy to combine with other atoms. Hence, the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$    QDs are unstable, which will restrict its extensive application.  \n\nBased on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM with various morph o logie s, the performance of PSCs has made great progress. Moreover, its application has been expanded to flexible devices and roll-to-roll  method without the limitation of high temperature process.  However, the performance of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM is still  not comparable to that of PSCs based on  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   ETM. As a result,  the following presents the challenges for PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  ETM and solutions to the problems.  \n\n# 6. The Modification of ZnO ETMs   for Efficient PSCs  \n\nAlthough the performance of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based PSCs has made  great progress, the PCEs of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based devices are still  inferior to those solar cells based on   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   ETM. The first  problem restricts the further development of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based  solar cells, which is the serious surface recombination. As well  known, perovskite materials have high carrier mobility and  reduced internal recombination, therefore the surface recombination plays an important role determining the performance of  PSCs.  \n\nThe recombination first comes from the intrinsic defects of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  . Similar to other semiconductor materials, point defects  affect the electrical and optical properties of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  . There are six  kinds of point defects in   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , which are   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   vacancies   $(\\mathrm{V_{Zn}})$  ,  oxygen vacancies   $\\mathrm{(V_{O})}$  , zinc interstitial   $(Z\\mathrm{n_{i}})$  , oxygen interstitials   $\\left(\\mathrm{O_{i}}\\right)$  , zinc antisites   $(\\mathrm{Zn_{O}})$  , and oxygen antisites   $\\left(\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{Zn}}\\right)$  .  Among them,  $\\mathrm{V_{O}}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Zn_{i}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{Zn_{O}}$   are donor defects and   $\\mathrm{V_{Zn}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{O_{i}}.}$  ,  and   $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{Zn\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
