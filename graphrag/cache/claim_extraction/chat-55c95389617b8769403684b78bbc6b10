Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

The fitted curves using the model described in the main text are shown by green lines. B) TRPL measurements of HTL containing samples without  interface layer, with PEAI, and with tBBAI.  \n\nInformation. Taking into account these cases, one can estimate the  surface recombination velocity for the different samples, which is   $33{\\pm}3\\ \\mathrm{cm\\s}^{-1}$   for the control,  $8{\\pm}3\\ \\mathrm{cm\\s}^{-1}$   for PEAI, and   $3{\\pm}3\\ \\mathrm{cm\\s}^{-1}$  for tBBAI which demonstrates the positive effect on surface defect  pass iv ation of PEAI and even more pronounced of tBBAI.  \n\nFigure    4 A shows the external   $\\mathrm{PLQY_{ext}}$   of the perovskite  films with the different interface layers and with HTL measured at an excess carrier generation rate corresponding to 1  sun conditions. We determined the   $\\mathrm{PLQY_{ext}}$   by AIPL measurements with the method described by de Mello et  al.,    $\\mathrm{PLQY}_{\\mathrm{ext}}=\\left.\\int P(E)\\,\\mathrm{d}E\\,/\\!\\int{L}_{\\mathrm{in}}(E)\\,\\mathrm{d}E\\right.$   , where   $P$   is the AIPL spectral  photon flux and   $L_{\\mathrm{in}}$   is the spectral photon flux of the excitation beam. The respective AIPL data are shown in Figure S3  in the Supporting Information. The   $\\mathrm{PLQY_{ext}}$   can be expressed  in terms of the radiative   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{rad}}\\right)$   and non radiative   $(R_{\\mathrm{nr}})$   recombination rates   $\\mathrm{PLQY_{ext}}=R_{\\mathrm{rad}}/(R_{\\mathrm{rad}}+R_{\\mathrm{nr}})$   which makes it a useful  tool to investigate bulk, interface, and surface charge recombination characteristics. As shown in Figure  4A, the   $\\mathrm{PLQY_{ext}}$    of PEAI is about three times and of tBBAI eight times higher  than the control sample without interface layer. The interface  layers cause a significant decrease of interface recombination s  at the perovskite/HTL interface which implies an improved  defect chemistry. From   $\\mathrm{PLQY_{ext}}$   the quasi-Fermi level splitting   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   can be calculated with the following equation:    $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}\\,=$     $q\\ V_{\\mathrm{OC,rad}}+k T\\ln(\\mathrm{PLQY}_{\\mathrm{ext}})$  ), where   $V_{\\mathrm{OC,rad}}$   is the radiative limit of   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}},$   the calculation of which is shown in the supplementary  information (Note S2, Supporting Information).   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}/q$   for the  differently treated films is shown in Figure  4B. The PEAItreated film shows a   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   increase of   $28\\ \\mathrm{meV}$   and the tBBAItreated film an increase of   $48\\,\\mathrm{\\meV}$   compared to the control  sample without interface layer. Since   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}/q$   is the maximum   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   that a PSC with this layer structure can exhibit, we present  measured   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  ’s of the complete PSCs with similar layer structure in Figure 4B as well. To be comparable with   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}/q$  , which  is determined from quasi-steady-state   $\\mathrm{PLQY_{ext}}$   measurements,  we measured the quasi-steady-state   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}':$  s, i.e., stabilized after  2 min exposure under 1 sun simulated illumination conditions.  We also show the stabilized   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  ’s of the same samples after   $30~\\mathrm{min}$   light soaking under 1 sun in ambient air. With PEAI  surface treatment, the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   increased by   $25~\\mathrm{mV}$   from 1.086 to   $1.111\\mathrm{~V~}$   and with tBBAI by   $41~\\mathrm{mV}$   to   $1.125\\mathrm{~V~}$   compared to the  control sample, which is in good agreement with the trend  seen in the  $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   measurements. The offset of   ${\\approx}40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$   between  the stabilized   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}/q$   can be explained by energetic  misalignment at both interfaces as has been shown by Caprioglio et  al.  This demonstrates the beneficial effect of PEAI  and tBBAI treatment in preventing inter facial charge carrier  recombination. Furthermore, it shows that tBBAI is a significantly better interface pass iv ation agent than PEAI with a   $65\\%$    higher  $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  increase compared to the sample without interface  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/599b0bf19a10e103e0ae3a7268373518d12e007511bdfcffd1d005a5dae3400a-1723835227.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   A) PLQY for the layer structure glass/FTO/c-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 /perovskite/interface layer with HTL.

After   $30~\\mathrm{min}$   under 1 sun light soaking the   $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$  ’s are   $32~\\mathrm{mV}$   for PEAI and   $56~\\mathrm{mV}$   for tBBAI-treated films,  which confirms the trend. Note that there is a   $15~\\mathrm{mV}~V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   drop  for the control sample,   $9\\mathrm{\\mV}$   drop for the PEAI, and a negligible   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   drop for the tBBAI-treated films. This shows that the  interface layers used here also increase the short-term   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   stability under light soaking in ambient air and that tBBAI shows  superior performance in comparison with PEAI.  \n\nTo further demonstrate the effect of these interface layers  on the op to electronic properties, we measured the TRPL of the  passivated per ovsk ites films with HTL (Figure 3B).
