Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

In contrast, the average  open-circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   shows similar values for   $x=0$   to 10,  but increases progressively with increasing GAI proportions  from  $x=15$   to 30. The observed variations of  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   might  be due to the combined effects of bandgap energies   $(E_{\\mathrm{g}})$   and  the band alignment, for which the   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   values continuously  increase (favoring larger   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}})$   whereas the energy levels of the  VB shift continuously downward upon increasing GAI proportions (Figure 2d) for E1G10 and E1G20 devices for which the  energy levels match better with that of the PEDOT:PSS layer  (favoring larger   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}})$  . For the FF values, a systematic variation  on the FF was observed with the best value occurring at the  E1G20 cell. As a result, the device with the best performance is  the   $\\mathrm{CA}_{0.2}\\mathrm{FA}_{0.78}\\mathrm{SnI}_{3}–1\\%$     $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   (E1G20) cell that shows average  PCE  $7.4\\pm0.3\\%$   and the best cell PCE   $8.5\\%$  .  \n\nThe additive   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   plays an important role in the PV performance of our tin-based hybrid cation planar PSC. We hence  used the G20 cell as a reference to fabricate devices with   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$    in varied proportions from   $0.5\\%$   to   $2\\%$  . Figure S7 (Supporting  Information) shows   $J{-}V$  curves of the   $\\mathtt{Egamma G}20$   cells with   $\\gamma=0$  ,  0.5, 1, and 2. The poor performance of the G20 cell is obvious,  for which PCE was only   $0.5\\%$   because the perovskite layer has  a poor morphology containing many pinholes, according to  the top-view SEM shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). When the proportion of   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   was increased, the PV  performance enhanced substantially, from PCE   $3.4\\%$   (E0.5G20)  increasing to   $7.9\\%$  (E1G20), and then slightly decreasing to  PCE   $7.2\\%$   (E2G20). This poor performance of the G20 cell is  attributed to the poor film coverage that led to serious charge  recombination in the device.   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   hence plays an important role to passivate the surface defects, to control the film  morphology, and to suppress the oxidation of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$   to   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  , as  reported elsewhere.

The fabrication of air-stable Sn  \n\nbased perovskite solar cells has been clearly a challenging task,  but we have tackled this problem on incorporating a nonpolar  organic cation with an effective additive in a trace proportion.  Manipulating the per ovsk ites with moisture-tolerant species is  promising strategies toward stable and efficient Sn-based PSC.  \n\nmaximum output point in air with humidity RH   ${\\approx}50\\%$  .
