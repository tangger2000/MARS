Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

APTES-capped MHP NPs had high stability and showed  slightly reduced PL intensity in various protic solvents for   $2.5\\:\\mathrm{h}$     $(\\approx\\!100\\%$   for NPs in methanol, and   ${\\approx}70\\%$   for NPs in ethanol  and isopropyl alcohol compared to the initial PL intensity),  however, NPs capped by linear organic ligands (i.e., oleic acid,  oct yl ammonium bromide) did not show any emission in protic  solvents; these results indicate that strong steric hindrance and  the hydrolysis properties of APTES efficiently prohibit the  penetration of protic solvents into the core NPs. APTES can  also prevent re dissolution of as-formed MHP NPs into DMF  solvent, and thus preserve the original shape and properties.  \n\nRecently, MHP NPs with thermally crosslink able and poly­ merizable  ligands,  4-vinyl benz yl-dimethyl oct a dec yl ammo- nium chloride (V18) have been reported ( Figure   12 A).  The  styryl group in V18 allows cross linking between MHP NPs;  the cross linked NPs based on V18 maintained high PLQE  very well   $(\\approx\\!100\\%$   of initial PL intensity in ambient condition  for one month and   ${\\tt>}80\\%$   of initial PL intensity in moisture  for   $120\\ \\mathrm{\\mum}$  ); in contrast, oct yl ammonium-bromide-based  un-cross linked NPs showed rapid decrease of PLQE   $({\\approx}65\\%$   of  the initial PL intensity in ambient conditions for one month and   ${\\approx}70\\%$   of the initial PL intensity in moisture for  $120\\;\\mathrm{min}$  ).  \n\nFabricating MHP NP–polymer composite films can also be  a good strategy to increase the stability of the NPs. MHP NP– polymer composite films have been composed of various polymers such as polystyrene, poly(methyl meth a cry late), PVDF,  polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, cellulose acetate,  poly(vinyl chloride), and ethyl cellulose;  due to  the good dispersion and efficient surface pass iv ation of NPs in  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/8847fb0c52be1232a7167ad4afc91fca507a430c717f6ba3371aa7a2d0e93a98-1723832769.jpg)  \nFigure 12.   A) The design of MHP NPs using V18 as a cross linking agent  and their applications.

The styryl group in V18 induces radical polymerization with other monomers (styrene and methyl meth a cry late),  and consequently formed polymer–V18–NP composites that  were highly stable in water for   ${\\tt>}90$   d (Figure 12B).  MHP NP– hydrophobic semi crystalline polymer (PVDF) composite films  have good solubility in organic solvents and strong interaction  between   $\\mathrm{CF_{2}}$   groups in PVDF and   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$   group in NPs;   as a result, color-tunable NP–PVDF composite films could be  easily fabricated; they maintained high PLQE under UV irradiation   $({\\approx}63\\%$   of the initial PLQE) and water   $({\\approx}68\\%$   of the initial  PLQE), which are similar to the PLQE of films without UV and  water   $(\\approx\\!70\\%$   of the initial PLQE).  \n\nPostligand engineering is used to exchange or remove  the ligand of the NPs after the synthesis process, but can  also affect the stability of MHP NPs. Methods that have been  tested to increase the luminescence efficiencies of MHP NPbased PeLEDs include replacing long ligands (here, oleylamine  and oleic acid) with shorter ligands  and reducing the concentration of surface ligands by ligand post engineering.   However, the ligand-exchange step and excess removal of  surface ligands may destabilize the MHP NPs in solution  and thereby reduce both the PLQE and the stability. Thus, to  improve the stability, the method of exchanging or removing  ligands from the surface of MHP NPs must be chosen carefully. Cross linking surface ligands on MHP NPs by depositing  hydroxide-terminated aluminum oxide can link the NPs and  make them insoluble in organic solvents.  These cross linked  NPs were not washed off by the organic solvents, and also  showed improved PLQE because their surface defects were passivated by alumina.  \n\n# 4. Summary and Outlook  \n\nWe have reviewed the origins of the low stability of PeLEDs by  categorizing the origins into instability: (i) of MHP materials  (the influence of crystal structure, temperature, atmosphere,  photo excitation on stability, and colloidal instability) and  (ii)  of  PeLED devices (each constituent layer and interface). Then, we reviewed recent progress in reducing these  instabilities. The cubic perovskite structure is the most stable  phase in MHPs and forms when   $0.813\\ \\leq\\ t_{\\mathrm{f}}\\ \\leq\\ 1.107$   and   $0.442\\leq o_{\\mathsf{c}}\\leq0.895$  . Thermal degradation occurs even at mode­ rate annealing temperature   $({\\approx}85\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   and is severe, especially  for  $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$  , due to its thermodynamic instability. This thermal  instability can be mitigated by using thermally stable A-site  cations (  $\\mathrm{(FA^{+}}$  and   $\\mathrm{Cs^{+}}$  ). The influence of oxygen on the luminescent properties is still controversial; the general opinion is that  light-induced formation of   ${\\mathrm{O}_{2}}^{-}$   causes decomposition of MHPs.  Degradation can be accelerated by hydration of MHPs under a  humid atmosphere, and by exposure to light. These instabilities under atmosphere and light exposure can be overcome by  using layered perovskite structures (RP MHPs) and cladding  layers.  \n\nDegradation of PeLEDs is mainly ascribed to the migration  of halide anions in response to an electrical field; the migration causes irreversible degradation from the interfaces, the  corrosion of metal electrodes, and the generation of defects  inside the MHP layers. Also, the formation of a   $\\mathsf{p-i-n}$   junction in the MHP layers might be related to the degradation.  Diffusion of metal atoms from electrodes can induce the  degradation of PeLEDs by providing shunting paths and non­ radiative recombination sites. Color instability of PeLEDs,  which is caused by easy ion migration and the presence of a  misc i bil it y gap, is also reviewed. Similar to the solutions for  instabilities under atmosphere and light exposure, instability  caused by ion migration can be mitigated by introducing layered perovskite structures and ion-blocking inter layers and  additives. The device stability can be further enhanced by  forming uniform MHP layers.  \n\nThe factors that limit the operational stability of PeLEDs  based on MHP NPs are identified, and strategies to make stable  MHP NPs are reviewed; the strategies include A-site cation  engineering, ligand engineering, and use of MHP NP–polymer  composites.  \n\nWe also suggest future research directions for achieving  high-stability PeLEDs. First, to extend the operational lifetime  of PeLEDs, the suitability of strategies to remove the electricfield-induced ion migration should be increased. Although  RP MHPs have been studied as a fundamental solution to  improve both the EL efficiency and the device stability, the  reported operational lifetimes of RP PeLEDs are just several hours,  which is much shorter than that of OLEDs.  This poor PeLED stability can be ascribed to a lack of understanding of the optimal RP phase; we must determine which  chemical structure of large-sized\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
