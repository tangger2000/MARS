Djurišic ´,\\* Li Huang,\\* and Zhubing He\\*  \n\nper ovsk ites  with the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as over   $22\\%$  .  Mixing organic cations with small  amounts of   $C s^{+}$   or   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$  cations leads to a  more favorable tolerance factor that facilitates the stabilization of the photo active  perovskite phase in a broader temperature  range  and results in their high thermal  and environmental stability in over   $1000\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$    of light soaking.  It is a crucial criterion for PSCs to scale up in the future  commercialization.  \n\nBoth conductivity and mobility are essential to charge transfer by carrier  transport layers (CTLs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The defects derived  from generally used ionic doping method lead to the degradation of carrier  mobility and parasite recombination s. In this work, a novel molecular  doping of   ${\\mathsf{N i o}}_{x}$   hole transport layer (HTL) is realized successfully by   $\\mathbf{\\delta}_{2,\\mathbf{\\bar{z}}^{\\prime}}$  -(per flu oro naphthalene-2,6-diylidene)di malo no nitrile (F6TCNNQ).  Determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron  spectroscopy, the Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathsf{F}}\\right)$   of   ${\\mathsf{N i o}}_{x}$  HTLs is increased from  $\\mathbf{-4.63}$   to   $-5.07\\,\\mathsf{e v}$   and valence band maximum (VBM)-  $\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\!\\cdot\\!\\pmb{E}_{\\mathsf{F}}$   declines from 0.58 to 0.29  eV after F6TCNNQ doping. The energy level offset between the VBMs of   $\\mathsf{N i o}_{x}$   and per ovsk ites declines from 0.18 to  $0.04\\,{\\sf e V}.$   Combining with firstprinciple calculations, electrostatic force microscopy is applied for the first  time to verify direct electron transfer from   $\\mathsf{N i o}_{x}$   to F6TCNNQ. The average  power conversion efficiency of CsFAMA mixed cation PSCs is boosted by  ${\\approx}8\\%$  depending on F6TCNNQ-doped NiO x  HTLs. Strikingly, the champion cell  conversion efficiency of CsFAMA mixed cations and  $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$  -based devices  gets to  $\\mathbf{20.86\\%}$   and   $\\mathbf{19.75\\%}$  , respectively. Different from pass iv ation effect, the  results offer an extremely promising molecular doping method for inorganic  CTLs in PSCs. This methodology definitely paves a novel way to modulate the  doping in hybrid electronics more than perovskite and organic solar cells.  \n\nAmong all the kinds of PSC device  structures, the planar he t ero junction,  especially the planar inverted device, has  attracted extensive attention of researchers  owing to its simpler device architecture and more facile fabrication.   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$    nano crystal film is an excellent choice  as hole transport layers (HTLs) in such  device structure,  because the valence  band maximum (VBM) of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  matches  well with that of mixed cation perovskites while its conduction band minimum  (CBM) is much higher than that of the  perovskite materials. This ensures the  \n\nIntensive research into organometallic halide perovskite  solar cells (PSCs) has led to the shift from pure methylammonium (MA) to form amid in i um (FA)-based mixed cation  \n\nmaximum photo current and minimum voltage losses of NiObased PSCs.  Although intrinsic NiO shows a p-type semiconductor,  with high hole mobility,  its major carrier (hole)  concentration is low and the Fermi level is far from its VBM,  which results in weak built-in field strength in a limited film  thickness and large energy level offset at the NiO–perovskite  interface.  Derived from that, the low holes transfer efficiency  of intrinsic NiO would result in hole accumulation near the  perovskite interface and hence large possibility of electron– hole recombination at the NiO–perovskite interface.  For  this concern, considerable efforts have been successfully made  to enhance p-type doping of NiO and hence to improve band  alignment at the NiO–perovskite interface by ionic doping of a  thin layer of NiO nano crystal films.  Ideally, this doped NiO  layer should be uniform, dense, and   $10{-}20~\\mathrm{nm}$   thick, which is  a challenge.  The ionic doping in NiO lattice definitely creates  considerable crystal lattice disorder and defects, hence causing  the degradation of carrier mobility and parasite recombination,  which demands the HTL thickness should be thin enough.   As a result, there is always a trade-off between carrier concentration and mobility in almost all the semiconductors when  doping. The perfect state is to possess both high mobility and  high conductivity at the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  –perovskite interface simultaneously. Moreover, the doping definitely complicates the fabrication procedure, shrinks its process window, and raises the cost.  \n\nOn the other hand, doping of semiconductors by organic  molecules is attracting more and more attention of researchers  in hybrid electronics.  Molecular p- or n-doping of colloid  quantum dots (CQDs) and 2D semiconductors have also been  demonstrated to improving the device performance of CQD  solar cell and increasing the field effect mobility of 2D semiconductors.  In term of NiO, such phosphonic acid contained  organic molecules as alkyl ph os phonic acid,  phosphonic  acid,  and 4-cyano phenyl ph os phonic acid  were used to  modulate the work function of NiO by means of charge transfer  between the hydroxyl a ted NiO surface and the ph os ph on ate  groups. However, this is not a good choice for PSCs due to the  yielded NiOOH interlayer, indefinite charge transfer direction,  and high possibility of undesired recombination. For NiObased PSCs, di ethanol amine (DEA) was used to improve the  crystalline quality of   $\\mathrm{\\sfMAPbI}_{3\\cdot X}\\mathrm{Cl}_{x}$   perovskite film and to passivate surface defects of NiO, resulting in an enhanced device  performance of near   $16\\%$   in PCE.  Combining the DEA  pass iv ation of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   surface with interface engineering at the  cathode side, PCE as high as   $18.1\\%$   was obtained for   $\\mathrm{\\mathrm{MA}P b I_{3}}.$  - based inverted PSCs.  However, in both works, DEA plays a  role as pas siva ting agent other than molecular doping for NiO.  Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the mechanism of  p-type doping of NiO by robust molecules with a facile modification process compatible with the fabrication of PSCs.  \n\nIn this work, a robust p-type molecular dopant,   $_{2,2^{\\prime}}$  -(perflu oro naphthalene-2,6-diylidene) di malo no nitrile (F6TCNNQ),  was successfully employed to modulate the p-type doping of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs in PSCs. F6TCNNQ is a strong electron-acceptor  molecule and low LUMO energy level   $(\\approx\\!5.37\\ \\mathrm{eV})$  ) of the molecular dopant  matches well with the VBM   $(\\approx\\!5.2~\\mathrm{eV})$   of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  .  Combining theoretical calculation and experimental characterization results, F6TCNNQ was discovered as an effective  p-type molecular dopant to increase both VBM and Fermi level  of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs, as well as upgrading the conductivity of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  film by increasing hole concentration inside. This results in the  reduction of\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
