Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

At the low temperature of   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the IR chemical map of   $C{=}S$   stretching exhibits consistent intensity (i.e., uniform red distribution), indicating a  homogeneous distribution and an interaction of the passivator  at the initial stage of perovskite crystal growth as shown in  Figure S7, Supporting Information. When the annealing temperature increases to   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (Figure 2e), the red areas of   $\\scriptstyle{C=S}$  stretching in IR chemical map begin to be independent, and  show aggregation and enrichment (change to yellow color) at  the crystal grain boundary. Such evolution of TSC specie distribution reveals that the small molecular pas siva tors do not volatilize and escape from the perovskite thin film, and conversely,  play an important role on the crystal regulation and pass iv ation  at grain boundaries.  \n\nWe further selected the area of perovskite grain boundary in  IR chemical map (Figure 2e) with high   $C{=}S$   stretching intensity, and performed the FTIR measurement (Figure  2f) to  acquire more details about the interaction between TSC and  perovskite. Compared to the IR spectra of pristine TSC, all  the   $C{=}S$   stretching peaks   $\\nu=1456~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ) and   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   bending  peaks   $(\\nu=1595~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$   show a redshift for   $\\mathrm{{SnI}_{2}/T S C}$   and   $\\mathrm{S nI}_{2}/$  CsI/TSC. Since the vibrational frequency is proportional to the  square root of the force constant in the harmonic motion of a  diatomic model, a vibration decrease of Lewis bases means that  the bond strength between sulfur and carbon decreases upon  the formation of the   $\\mathrm{{SnI}_{2}/\\mathrm{{TSC}}}$  , suggesting a strong chemical  interaction between   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   and sulfur in the Lewis base. Compared with   $\\mathrm{C=}\\mathrm{S}$   stretching peaks, the   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   bending and   $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$   stretching peaks exhibit relatively weak shifts, demonstrating that the bonding between   $C{=}S$   and   $\\mathrm{Sn}$   is the dominant coordination type in TSC-treated per ovsk ites. Moreover,  with the increasing annealing temperature, the  $C{=}S$   stretching  peaks further redshift, demonstrating the stronger Lewis acidbase interaction between   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   and S donor in passivator. The  enhanced interaction might be attributed to the increased electron cloud density provided from uncoordinated S and N atoms  due to the aggregation of TSC on perovskite surface and grain  boundaries.  Additionally, the per ovsk ites treated with the  other three pas siva tors all show obvious vibration change from  more IR and NMR information in Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information.  \n\nA schematic illustration of the Lewis base TSC passivator  assisted crystal growth process for   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   perovskite is shown  in Figure   $_{2\\mathrm{g}}$  . At the beginning of annealing process, the TSC  molecules are inserted into the   $\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nI}_{2}$   interlayer and anchored  on  $\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nI}_{2}$   by the strong coordination and Lewis acid-base interaction between the  $\\scriptstyle S=C-\\mathrm{N}$   functional group and Sn ion. During  the annealing process, the perovskite precursors could interact  by overcoming the reaction activation energy barrier, and the  perovskite crystallization would like to take place at the interface between   $\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nI}_{2}$   and CsI. Meanwhile, the TSC molecules  would link onto the surface of as-formed   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   perovskite  crystals, reducing the number of nuclei and enlarging the  grain size. While prolonging the annealing time, the TSC  molecules anchored on perovskite could be assembled on the  grain boundary and surface, further pas siva ting the Sn-related  defects as shown in Figure   $_{2\\mathrm{g}}$  .  \n\nTo estimate the Sn induced defect and oxidation in the presence and absence of a surface passivator, the chemical-state  and electrical-state analysis of perovskite film surface using  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Kelvin probe force  microscope (KPFM) were performed, as shown in  Figure   3 a,b.  In the XPS spectra, the two main peaks at 486 and   $494.5~\\mathrm{eV}$   are  ascribed to   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   for   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$  , respectively, and the fitting  peaks located at 487 and   $495.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   are assigned to the binding  energies for   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  .  As discussed above, the conversion of   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  ions into   $^{4+}$   state is generally considered as the major source  of defect formation in   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  -based halide perovskite materials. The  $\\mathrm{Sn}$   valence-state in the pristine   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   film shows a significant   $^{4+}$   state, suggesting the serious oxidation at its perovskite  surface. After introducing a TSC passivator, the   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   characteristic peak presents an obvious reduction in intensity. Similar  results were also obtained from the samples treated with TU  and TAA (Figure S12, Supporting Information). We can therefore infer that the Lewis-base   $\\scriptstyle S=C-\\mathrm{N}$   functional group in  thioamides-type pas siva tors is essential for retarding the oxidation of   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   at the surface of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   films. Figure 3b presents  the KPFM potentials of perovskite surface treated with and  without the TSC passivator. As a consequence of calibrating the  cantilever on the reference Au sample, the Fermi Level of each  film can be given directly. For better comparison, the KPFM  images are flattened and presented in the same color range bar  (Figure S13, Supporting Information). When treating with the  TSC passivator, the contact potential statistic value varies from  around   $-5.15\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for pristine   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   to   $-5.03\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for TSC pas- sivated   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$  , suggesting the decreased hole concentration at  the perovskite surface due to the effective inhibition on the generation of Sn vacancies.  \n\nNext, the photo luminescence (PL) characterization was further implemented to study the trap states of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   thin films.  Figure 3c shows the steady-state PL spectra of per ovsk ites with  and without pass iv ation. When the TSC is introduced, the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   thin film shows a stronger PL intensity with a very slight  blue-shift, suggesting suppressed non radiative trap-assisted  recombination.  The TSC could also assist the growth of  perovskite crystals, leading to improved grain size and reduced  grain boundaries thereby influencing the PL properties. The  time-resolved PL spectra in Figure 3d displays more trap-state  and carrier recombination information by a fitted bi-exponential decay model   $(\\gamma=A_{1}\\mathrm{exp}[-(x{-}x_{0})/\\tau_{1}]\\,+\\,A_{2}\\mathrm{exp}[-(x{-}x_{0})/\\tau_{2}])$  ,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/b87693ea29dbb10196ce1ceb0714ac29e6917f3e80cb228802d69443473531c3-1727101098.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   a) High-resolution XPS spectra   $(\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
