Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

It is found that the   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive can significantly enhance the crystal quality, thus  reducing the defect density and increasing the carrier lifetime  of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, as well as increase the Fermi level of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and raise the built-in potential and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    PSCs. As a result, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs based on   $0.5\\%$     $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$    additive achieve a record PCE of   $16.79\\%$   with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.32\\mathrm{~V~}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/effb9007267eb26fdddc1d0c6fe2b6b4fe0178dfe525a7d673537bd80323403a-1723829586.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   precursor films without and with  $0.5\\%$   or  $\\left|\\%\\subset\\mathsf{a C}\\right|_{2}$   additives after annealing at   $35~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for different times. b) XRD  patterns and the magnified (200) peaks of   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films with different concentrations of   $\\mathsf{C a C}|_{2}$   additives. c) UV–vis absorption spectra and Tauc plots  of   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films without and with   $0.5\\%$   $\\mathsf{C a C}|_{2}$   additive. d) Steady-state PL spectra and e) PL decay curves of   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films without and with   $0.5\\%$     $\\mathsf{C a C}|_{2}$   additive.  \n\nand a FF of   $83.29\\%$  .

Results and Discussion  \n\nUltralow  $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   doping concentrations with a   $\\mathrm{Ca/Pb}$   molar ratio  of   $0{-}1\\%$   are employed because excess   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive will undermine the perovskite crystallization.  Figure   1 a shows comparative photographs of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films without and with   $0.5\\%$   or   $1\\%\\;{\\mathrm{CaCl}}_{2}$   additives after annealing at   $35~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for different times.  From the variation of film color,   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   decreases the growth  rate of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, which may be conducive to improving  the quality of the perovskite film. In order to find out which  ion (  $^{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{Ca^{2+}}}$   or   $C\\mathrm{l^{-}}$  ) plays the main role to retard the crystal lization process of perovskite film, the   ${\\mathrm{CaI}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{PbCl_{2}}$   were used  as additives. As shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, the perovskite precursor film with  ${\\mathrm{CaI}}_{2}$   additive shows  a slower crystallization process compared with control film  without additive or the film with   $\\mathrm{{PbCl}_{2}}$   additive. Therefore,  the existence of   $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$   is the reason for the decrease of crystallization rate. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    with various concentrations of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additives are characterized  and provided in Figure 1b. All the films exhibit similar diffraction peaks located at   $14.60^{\\circ}$   and   $29.48^{\\circ}$   that correspond to the  (100) and (200) crystal planes, respectively, of   $\\alpha$  phase  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    perovskite.  The intensities of the diffraction peaks are substantially increased with   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   addition, reaching a maximum  for   $0.5\\%$     $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  . The film with   $0.5\\%$     $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive also has  the narrowest full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the  (200) peaks (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). These  results indicate that the crystal lin it y of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite can  be improved by   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive. When   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   ions (ionic radius of   $120\\,\\mathrm{pm})$  ) are partially substituted with Ca ions   $(99\\,\\mathrm{pm})$  , the XRD  peaks are expected to have a higher 2 theta angle shift due to  shrinkage of the crystal lattice. However, as shown in Figure 1b,  the shifts of the (200) peaks are negligible, which is probably  due to the minimal doping below the measurement resolution  or Ca ions being unincorporated into the crystal lattice.   In order to further determine the influence of the   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive contents on the XRD peak position, perovskite films with  high concentrations of   $3\\%$  ,   $5\\%$  , and   $10\\%~\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additives are  prepared. As shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information, the peak intensity decreased substantially with increasing  additive concentration, while the peak position did not shift.  This result indicates that excessive   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   addition affects the  quality of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, and rules out the possibility that the  unshifted XRD peak is due to minimal doping. On the other  hand, it has previously been found that the large difference  in the ionic radii of Cl   $(181~\\mathrm{pm})$   and I (  $(216~\\mathrm{pm})$   ions hinders  the incorporation of Cl ions into the crystal lattice of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$    perovskite, and Cl ions tend to be located in the grain boundaries of perovskite films.  Therefore, we believe that   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$    cannot dope into the lattice of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br};$  , and is instead located  in the grain boundaries of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  film. For comparison,  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films without and with an optimized   $0.5\\%$     $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$    additive are labeled as the control and optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    films, respectively.  \n\nThe absorption spectra of the control and optimized CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films are given in Figure  1c. Both films have identical  absorption\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
