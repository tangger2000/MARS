Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The thermal decomposition of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi starts at   ${\\approx}370\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (the extrapolated onset temperature is   $T_{\\mathrm{{o}}}\\,=\\,340~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{{C}})$  ),  which is much higher than those for   $(\\mathrm{C_{4}N_{2}H_{14}X})_{4}\\mathrm{SnX_{6}}$   (  $\\mathrm{(X=Br,}$   $\\mathrm{I)}^{[8]}$   as well as the typical   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   halide per ovsk ites, indicating  the better thermal stability for the all-inorganic  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  .  \n\nTo gain more information on the photo physical properties  of Bi-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}.$  , UV–vis absorption and PL spectroscopy  were taken under ambient atmosphere and are presented in  Figure   2 . The pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   shows a sharp optical absorption edge at   $315\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   (  $3.93\\,\\mathrm{\\eV},$  , black line in Figure 2a), con- sistent with the previous report with an excitonic absorption  at   $3.9\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   (  $(317\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  .  Upon bismuth incorporation, besides  the absorption band edge by host   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  , there is an additional absorption peak at around   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$     $(3.10\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}})$   (inset to  Figure 2a), which would be assigned to the transitions from the  defect band (i.e., the new valence band maximum consisting  of   $\\mathrm{Cl}\\;3\\mathrm{p}$   and Bi 6s orbitals, VBM ′ ) to the host conduction band  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/65b898128da29d8ea036e6db47888fc5a72ea50b3a8a89a414536f60724e6191-1723824433.jpg)  \nFigure 2.  $\\mathsf{o f C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{\\cdot}x\\mathsf{B i}$  .

It should be noted the increased Bi doping concentrations led to stronger absorption of this additional absorption  peak between 360 and   $400\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nSimilar to the absorption, the PL excitation (PLE) spectra  also showed peaks between 320 and   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . For photoluminescence upon excitation at   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 2b), the emission  spectra of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi showed a peak around   $454~\\mathrm{nm}$   with  a wide FWHM of   $66~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   and a large Stokes shift of   $90\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  .  In sharp contrast, the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   showed no photoluminescence even at stronger excitation intensity. PLE spectra  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi at   $454\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   are plotted by dashed red curve in  Figure 2b. Notably, there is a sharp dip below   $310~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  , where  light is fully absorbed by the host and does not excite the luminescent centers. In this region, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   exhibits a sharp  peak in the absorption spectrum. This means that there is no  energy transfer between the host and the luminescent centers.  We surmise that the intrinsic non radiative transitions caused by  the strong relaxation and vibration led to the strong energy dissipation to the host   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}.$  , so the energy is not transferred  to Bi. Such result is similar to the case of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{4}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{6}$    matrix.  As for the wide emission and large Stokes shift,  we hypothesize the reason as self-trapped exciton, in analogy  to typically observed broadband photo luminescence in 0D  and corrugated-2D metal halide per ovsk ites.  For a halide  perovskite with polar iz able lattice, photo generated excitons  often cause the transient deformation of crystal lattice and are  thus localized, forming the so-called self-trapped excitons. This  elastic lattice distortion changes the nuclear coordinate and dissipates some energy from exciton, leading to broadband emission with large Stokes shift.  \n\nWe further studied PLQY values for the as-synthesized   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi powder. The PLQY was directly measured by FLS980  spec tro flu ori meter with an integrating sphere and excitation  light at  $365\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  . The PLQY was calculated by following formula  \n\n$$\n\\eta=\\left(\\int L_{\\mathrm{direct}}-\\int L_{\\mathrm{bulk}}\\right)/\\left(\\int E_{\\mathrm{without}}-\\int E_{\\mathrm{direct}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\eta$  is the photo luminescent quantum yield,   $L_{\\mathrm{direct}}$   is the  complete emission spectrum of the sample collected by using  the integrating sphere,   $L_{\\mathrm{black}}$   is the emission spectrum of the  blank sample,   $E_{\\mathrm{direct}}$  is the emission spectra of the excitation  light, recorded with the sample in place, and   $E_{\\mathrm{without}}$   is the  emission spectrum of excitation light, recorded with the equipment blank in place. The part   $(\\bar{L_{\\mathrm{direct}}}\\,-\\,\\int\\!L_{\\mathrm{black}})$   expresses the  photons emitted by our sample, and   $(\\int\\!E_{\\mathrm{without}}-\\int\\!E_{\\mathrm{direct}})$   means  the photons emitted by excitation light source. As shown in  Table   1  and  Figure   3 a,   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6};x\\mathrm{Bi}$   with   $x=0.11\\%$  ,   $1.16\\%$  ,  and  $2.75\\%$   showed the PLQY of   $67.6\\%$  ,   $68.3\\%$  , and  $78.9\\%$  . That  is, PLQY grows with the increasing   $x$   in the low   $x$   region. It  should be noted PLQY peaked at a specific   $x=2.75\\%$  , leading  to the highest value of   $78.9\\%$  . When   $_x$   increased further to   $3.39\\%$  ,   $4.18\\%$  , and   $6.63\\%$  , the resulting PLQYs decreased  to   $57.4\\%$  , to   $56.5\\%$  , and to   $38.1\\%$  , respectively. We want to  emphasize that the observed   $78.9\\%$   PLQY here is the highest  one among all lead-free halide per ovsk ites with blue emissions   $(\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Pb}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   QDs:   $46\\%$  ,   $\\mathrm{{\\OD\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
