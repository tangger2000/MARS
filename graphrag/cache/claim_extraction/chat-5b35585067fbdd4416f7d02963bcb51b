Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

After electrical erasing operation, the threshold voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right)$   can be shifted back to its initial state, implying the release  of the trapped electrons. A memory window of   ${\\approx}16.47\\mathrm{~V~}$   was  obtained which is defined as the difference between the programmed state   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   and erased state   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$  . Typical   $I{-}V$  curves of  the memory device programmed with various light irradiance  are shown in Figure 2c.   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   of memory device in the initial state  is located at   $-12.51$   V. Note that the   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   of the memory device  gradually shifted from  $-9.09$   to   $-5.48$  ,   $-1.12$  , and   $2.99\\ \\mathrm{V}$   when  the light intensity increased from 0.041 to 0.069, 0.129, and   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  .  \n\nTo address the maintenance capability of the trapped charge  carriers, light programming operations with a series of control  parameters were carried out on the flash memory.  Figure 2d  shows the transient curve of flash memory programmed by  the light pulses with fixed irradiance of   $0.153\\,\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}}$   and  wavelength ranging from 365 to   $660\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  .  Light illumination  with short wavelengths induces the large enhancement of  the   $I_{\\mathrm{DS}}$   which can reach   ${\\approx}10^{-8}$   A for   $520~\\mathrm{nm}$  ,   ${\\approx}6\\times10^{-8}$   A for   $450\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , and   ${\\approx}10^{-7}$   A for   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   while red light irradiation   $(660~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) produces weakest effect which is consistent with the  strong absorption of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   in the UV region. All the photoprogrammed states can be maintained for more than   $1\\times10^{4}$   s  without obvious degradation. The stable current levels promise  at least four data level storage in one single memory cell  through simple tuning the light wavelength. Figure 2e outlines  the impact of the light intensity on the memory devices. With  a fixed wavelength of   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  , the light intensity is varied from  0.041 to   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~cm}^{-2}$  . Photo-to-dark current ratio is gradually increased with the enhanced light intensity.  The photoprogramming process is also highly dependent on the  light  illuminating time, which can be applied to control the photo­ recording functionality.  As shown in Figure   $2\\mathrm{f}_{\\ast}$  , illumination  with longer endurance induces a higher recorded current  after the photo programming. However,   $I_{\\mathrm{DS}}$   almost achieves its  maximum level after light programming operation with the  pulse width longer than   $120~\\mathrm{s}$  , which is attributed to the limited charge trapping centers inside the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs layer. As  the surface of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs layer is passivated by PMMA  film, the flash memory shows uniform electrical characteristics  in Figure S3 (Supporting Information).  The good reproducibility of the repetitive photo programming and electrical-erasing  cycles in ambient conditions is depicted in Figure 2g. Both the  programmed erased states of the device can be maintained  for cyclic operations of   $10^{3}$   times without significant fluctuations. The retention test in Figure S4 (Supporting Information)  suggests the possibility of attaining the industry-standard of ten  years data retention.  \n\nThe energy band diagrams of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  -based flash memories  under light programming operation and the electric erasing  operation

Schematic energy diagram  of the device during light programming operation and during electrical erasing operation under dark condition.  \n\nphoto programming operation, large numbers of charge carriers were generated in the active layer. Photo generated holes  can easily escape from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   to pentacene through a  bending of energy band and thus leaving behind photoinduced  electrons in the conduction band of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  . The trapped  electrons can act as an additional internal electric filed which  further accelerates the holes to be swept into the semiconductor  channel. After the removal of the light stimuli, trapped charge  carriers are retained by the potential well for a long lifetime.
