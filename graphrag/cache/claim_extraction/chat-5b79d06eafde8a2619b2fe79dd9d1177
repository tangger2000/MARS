Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The performances of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells are summarized in  Table   1 .

The  large enhancements of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and FF in this cell are mainly due  to the improved crystal lin it y and reduced non radiative recombination loss in the perovskite films. As shown in Figure  6a,  the   $J{-}V$  curves from forward and reverse scanning of the  PSCs show a small hysteresis. The hysteresis is unavoidable  in inorganic PSCs with mixed halide compositions due to the  iodide and bromide phase segregation under illumination. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is obtained to confirm  the validity of the  $J{-}V$   scan results. As shown in Figure 6b, the  DSMO-adducted device displays notable enhancement over a  broad spectral range of   $350{-}680\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . The integrated photocurrent densities of the control and DSMO-adducted devices are  13.42 and   $15.10\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, which are in good agreement with the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   values derived from the   $J{-}V$   measurements  (Figure 6a). The stabilized power output (SPO) of the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  cells is shown in Figure  6c. While maintaining the bias near  the maximum power output point (0.99 V), the stabilized photocurrent for the DSMO-adducted device is   $14.75\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}^{-2}}$  ,  corresponding to a stabilized efficiency of   $14.67\\%$  .  \n\nFurthermore, under open-circuit conditions, the relationship between the open circuit voltage and the light intensity  is utilized to elucidate the recombination mechanism within  the inorganic PSCs. By plotting   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   as a function of incident  light intensity   $(I)$  , as shown in Figure  6d, the recombination  mechanism can be understood through applying the equation   $V_{\\lambda}=V_{\\mathrm{s}}+(n k_{\\mathrm{B}}T/q)\\mathrm{ln}(P_{\\lambda}/P_{\\mathrm{S}})$  ,  where   $V_{\\lambda}$   and   $V_{S}$   are the opencircuit voltages at light intensity   $P_{\\lambda}$   and at the standard light  intensity   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$  , respectively.  n ,   $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$  ,  T , and   $q$   are the ideality factor,  Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and elementary  charge, respectively. Clearly, the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of the DSMO-adducted  device at various light intensities is higher than that of the  control device, implying a mitigated voltage loss in the DSMOadducted device. The fitted lines show the slopes ( n ) of 2.23 for  the control device and 1.16 for the DSMO-adducted device. The  reduced slope of the DSMO-adducted device approaches unity  and affirms the suppressed Shockley–Read–Hall recombination, which agrees with the PL results (Figure 5c).  \n\nFigure 6e,f shows the histograms of PCEs for 40 devices of  each type. For PSCs based on DSMO adducts, the PCEs are distributed in a narrow range between   $12.75\\%$   and   $14.80\\%$   (average  PCE over  $13.95\\%$  , which shows good reproducibility. Such high  performance can be attributed to the high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$  films crystallized with the involvement of DMSO adducts. For  the control devices, the PCEs are distributed in a wide range  between   $7.75\\%$   and   $11.40\\%$   (average PCE is   $9.76\\%$  . The dramatically improved efficiency and reproducibility evidence the  merits of incorporating DMSO-adducts as precursors for the  fabrication of films for inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   solar cells.  \n\nAlthough researchers have found that inorganic CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells show good stability under light illumination or high temperature, the stability of those devices in  the ambient atmosphere is still poor.  In this work, the air  stability of the DSMO-adducted and control devices without  encapsulation is also investigated. The devices are stored  in a constant temperature–humidity vessel, where the temperature and humidity are   ${\\approx}25\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and   ${\\approx}20\\%$  , respectively.  As shown in  Figure 7 a, the un encapsulated DSMO-adducted  solar cells exhibit negligible efficiency loss after aging for   $500\\,\\textrm{h}$  .

As is well known, the structure of the  perovskite layers and the environmental stability of PSCs are  closely linked.  The higher stability of the DSMO-adducted  PSC devices comes from the smooth surfaces and high crystallinity of the perovskite layers (Figure  3b; Figure  S3, Sup- porting Information), which prevents moisture from being  absorbed and diffused.  This good stability of the DMSOmodified device is also confirmed by the well-maintained  photo active layer (Figure \nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
