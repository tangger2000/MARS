Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In Figure S3e of the Supporting Information, the  three de convoluted peaks located at about 398.4, 399.8, and   $401.3\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   can be assigned to the pyridine-like N, pyrrole-like  N, and graphite-like N, respectively.  Furthermore, the  active material   $(\\mathrm{MoS}_{2})$   contents of the samples are tested by  thermo grav i metric analysis, and the curves are revealed in  Figure S4 of the Supporting Information. By presuming that  the final substances are   $\\mathrm{MoO}_{3}$   after calcination processes  in oxygen atmosphere, the mass fraction of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   in the  D  $\\cdot\\mathrm{L}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Mo}S_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NC}$  , and   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   are   $95.6\\%$  ,   $93.6\\%$  , and   $87.5\\%$  , respectively.  The specific surface areas  of the different   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$   samples are also investigated by   $\\Nu_{2}$   adsorption–desorption isotherms and the results are shown  in Figure S5 of the Supporting Information. As calculated by  Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   displays  a higher specific area   $(49\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{g}^{-1})$   than that of   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NC}$  and DL $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$   (19 and  $4\\;\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1})$  ), which is more beneficial  for  $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   storage.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/88800eba3ed577787e5ff5e7ac4758086f24251b838a9a972287c3229d54778a-1727117751.jpg)  \nFigure 3.    $\\mathsf{N a^{+}}$   storage performance of the different samples. a) The first charge–discharge voltage profiles at   $0.1\\ \\mathsf{A}\\ \\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   and b) rate capabilities of the  three  ${\\mathsf{M o S}}_{2}@{\\mathsf{N G}}$   samples. c) A comparison of rate performance of  $\\mathsf{U S.M o S_{2}@N G}$   with some other reported insertion-type anode materials. d) Cycling  investigation of the as-prepared products at   $1\\;{\\sf A g^{-1}}$  , including the corresponding Coulombic efficiency of US  ${\\tt-M o S}_{2}@{\\tt N C}$  .  \n\nFigure   3  presents the   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   inter cal ation behavior of the asprepared anode materials under a cut-off voltage   $(0.4{-}3\\;\\mathrm{~V~})$  ,  including both the rate and cycling performance. In detail,  Figure 3a displays the voltage profiles of the three   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$  samples during the first charge–discharge cycle at   $0.1\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$  . The  discharge-specific capacities of the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$  , F  $\\mathfrak{i}_{\\mathrm{L}\\cdot\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathbb{Q}}$  NG, and   $\\mathrm{DL}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   anodes are 416, 393, and   $384\\;\\mathrm{mArh\\;g}^{-1}$  ,  respectively. More importantly, the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   shows the  highest potential of the discharge platform, which can be attributed to the largest lattice distance between the   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   layers and,  thus, resulting in the lowest barrier energy of   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   intercalation.  This phenomenon is also confirmed by their CV  results, which are presented in Figure S6a–c of the Supporting  Information. Figure 3b shows the rate performance of the three  samples. As can be seen, the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   anode reveals a  reversible capacity of   $141\\mathrm{\\mAr\\g^{-1}}$   even under a high rate of   $12.8\\mathrm{~A~g}^{-1}$  , which is more favorable than that of F  $\\mathrm{{'L-MoS}_{2}@N G}$  and DL  $\\cdot\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NC}$   (86 and   $38\\ \\mathrm{mArh\\g^{-1}})$  ). In addition, it can be  obviously discovered that the capacity differences of the three  samples are increased in order with the rising of the current  densities, which means more beneficial inter cal ation reaction  kinetics possessed by   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$  . Moreover, the US  $\\cdot\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@$  NG composite still displays similar rate performance even  under higher mass loading   $(>\\!2.0\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\meg~}}\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{cm}}^{-2}$  ; Figure S7, Supporting information). To best of our knowledge, the rate  capability of the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   is superior to that of many  other insertion-type electrode materials previously reported,  such as the   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}/\\mathrm{C}$   hybrids,    $\\mathrm{MoS_{2}/L i_{4}T i_{5}O_{12}}$   hybrids,  $\\mathrm{Li_{4}T i_{5}O_{12}/T i O_{2}}$   nanowire arrays,    $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   nanosheets/graphene  composites,    $\\mathrm{Ti}S_{2}$    nanoplates,    $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{O}_{7}@\\mathrm{C}$    hollow  spheres,  and  $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{5}@\\mathrm{RGO}$   composites  for NIBs (Figure 3c).  \n\nThis more favorable sodium-storage behavior demonstrated  by   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   can be ascribed to its reasonable structural  design, which will be discussed later in detail. The cycling tests  are also employed to further evaluate the sodium-storage perfor­ mance of the as-prepared products. Figure S8 of the Supporting  Information shows the 1st, 10th, and 50th charge/discharge  voltage curves of   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   anode at  $1\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$  , which reveals  an excellent reversible capability of the charge and discharge  capacities except for the first cycle. From Figure 3d, we can see  that the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   is robust enough to achieve a highly  stable cycling performance, illustrating a specific capacity of   $198\\ \\mathrm{mAr\\g^{-1}}$   at 1 A   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   after 1000 cycles, leading an average  reversible capacity loss of 0.03 mAh   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   per cycle. As shown  in Figure S9 of the Supporting Information, the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@$  NG composite can still retain its hierarchical morphology after  cycling performance, thus proving the favorable structural  stability during the electrochemical reactions. As a contrast,  the cycling stability of the   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NC}$   and\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
