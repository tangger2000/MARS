In order to visualize the  electron density distribution, as shown in Figure 1a, the electrostatic potential (ESP) of DFPDA is analyzed by DFT method. The positive ESP (blue region) is mainly located at the amino  group, while the   $C=\\mathrm{O}$   bond presents a high electron density  (orange region). The strong electron-donating amino groups on  DFPDA significantly increase the electron density on the  $C=\\mathrm{O}$  groups,  which can significantly increase the coordination  or binding strength between   $C=\\mathrm{O}$   groups in DFPDA and the  under-coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   defects in the perovskite. In addition,  the fluorine groups in DFPDA lead to a stronger hydrophobic  effect, which is important for enhancing the moisture resistance of perovskite devices in ambient conditions.  \n\nTo evaluate the interaction between DFPDA and the perovskite precursor, the interaction energy between DFPDA and   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   was calculated. As shown in Figure 1b and Table S1, Supporting Information, the interaction energy of DFPDA and  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  is calculated to be  $-0.85\\;\\mathrm{eV}.$   To explore the influence of the adjacent amino group on the interaction between   $C=\\mathrm{O}$   and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  ,  the amino groups in the DFPDA are replaced with hydrogen  groups to calculate the interaction energy (Figure 1c). The interaction energy between 2,2-di flu oro propane dial (DFPPD) and   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   is only  $-0.43~\\mathrm{eV},$  , indicating that the amino groups indeed  increase the coordination ability of   $C=\\mathrm{O}$   and   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  .  Bader  charge analysis also shows that the charge of the O in   $C=\\mathrm{O}$   in  DFPDA   $(7.858~e)$  ) is larger than that in DFPPD (7 .741  e ), which  originates from the electron donation of the amino group.  These results confirm the combined pass iv ation effect of the  two functional groups on the same defect sites in perovskite.  \n\nIn order to further confirm the pass iv ation and water/ oxygen barrier effects of DFPDA on perovskite, the defect formation energies and water/oxygen absorption energies were  calculated.
