As well known, the ITO usually used has rough surface, as shown in Figure 3l, as a result, the 5 nm ZnO film cannot fully cover the rough ITO surface, which forms a shunting path and decreases the solar cell performance. Figure 3m,n shows the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption and PL spectra of perovskite /ZnO/ITO, as can be seen, with the thickness of ZnO film increasing from 10 to 30 nm, the exciton dissociation at the interface between ZnO and perovskite is improved, which then improves the solar cell performance. Once the ZnO film thickness exceeds 30 nm, the series resistance of the ZnO film increases, which again decreases the photovoltaic performance.

The schematic illustration of electrostatic spraying device is shown in Figure 4a. The general process of electrostatic spraying is that the precursor solution is sprayed and deposited onto a substrate under high voltage. The properties of ZnO films are tuned by changing substrate temperature, precursor solution flow rate (droplet size), substrate-to-nozzle distance, applied voltage, and deposition time.

In this research, they systematic studied the influence of spraying parameters on the morphology of ZnO thin films and fabricated PSCs based on the optimized ZnO film. According to their results, dense and uniform ZnO films can be obtained from large applied voltage, high substrate temperature, longer substrate-to-nozzle distance, and suitable deposition time. Based on the mutual restriction between these parameters, they optimized the ZnO films and prepared PSCs based on ZnO films with different thicknesses further. The J-V curves of these PSCs are shown in Figure 4b. As can be seen, with the increase of ZnO film thickness from 440 to 745 nm, the PCE dropped from 10.8% to 3.4%. The drop of PCE mainly comes from the increase of series resistance induced by the thicker ZnO ETM.
