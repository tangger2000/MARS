Over the  past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from   $3.8\\%^{[2]}$   to   $25.2\\%$  ,  approaching the record  efficiency of   $26.7\\%$   of crystalline silicon  solar cells,  and becoming one of the  most promising candidates for the nextgeneration efficient and low-cost photovoltaic devices.  For example, Seok and  co-workers introduced additional iodide  into precursor solutions, resulting in a certified PCE of   $22.1\\%$  .  Recently, Kim et al.  investigated the effects of methylammonium chloride (MACl) on the performance  of perovskite films and fabricated a device  that achieved a certified PCE of   $23.5\\%$  .  It  is important to note that all these efficient  devices were fabricated with high-temperature-processed   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   mesoporous struc-  \n\nAn electron-transport layer (ETL) with appropriate energy alignment and  enhanced charge transfer is critical for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However,  inter facial energy level mismatch limits the electrical performance of PSCs,  particularly the open-circuit voltage   $(v_{\\mathsf{o c}})$  . Herein, a simple low-temperature-processed   $\\mathsf{I n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   bilayer ETL is developed and used for fabricating a new PSC  device. The presence of   ${\\mathsf{I n}}_{2}{\\mathsf{O}}_{3}$   results in uniform, compact, and low-trap-density  perovskite films. Moreover, the conduction band of   ${\\mathsf{I n}}_{2}{\\mathsf{O}}_{3}$   is shallower than that  of Sn-doped  $\\mathsf{I n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   (ITO), enhancing the charge transfer from perovskite to ETL,  thus minimizing   $v_{\\infty}$   loss at the perovskite and ETL interface. A planar PSC  with a power conversion efficiency of   $\\pmb{23.24\\%}$   (certified efficiency of   $22.54\\%)$   is  obtained. A high   $v_{\\infty}$   of   $1.17\\,\\upnu$   is achieved with the potential loss at only  $\\mathbf{0.36\\,\\upnu.}$    In contrast, devices based on single  $\\mathsf{s n o}_{2}$   layers achieve  $\\pmb{21.42\\%}$   efficiency with a   $v_{\\infty}$   of   $\\mathsf{1.13\\,v.}$   In addition, the new device maintains  $97.5\\%$   initial efficiency after \n\n  $\\tt{80\\,d}$   in  $\\Nu_{2}$   without encapsulation and retains  $91\\%$   of its initial efficiency after  \n\n  $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\,\\,180\\,h}}$   under 1 sun continuous illumination. The results demonstrate and pave  the way for the development of efficient photovoltaic devices.  \n\ntures, thus limiting their widespread application. Developing  low-temperature-processed electron-transport layer (ETL)  for  planar structure devices is of great importance.  Among them,   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  ,    $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  ,  and [6]-phenyl $C_{61}$  -butyric acid methyl ester   $(\\mathrm{PCHM})^{[12]}$   are the most commonly used ones.  \n\nThe lower efficiency of devices based on planar structures is  closely related to insufficient charge extraction  and imperfect  inter facial band alignment.  The insufficient charge extraction  between perovskite and ETL can result in charge accumulation,  which negatively affects device performance.  Therefore, sufficient charge extraction is one of the most important contributors for device efficiency.  Recently, researchers have focused  on the use of bilayer ETL,  and the bilayer stack structure has  been demonstrated to be effective for improving device efficiency. As early as 2014,  Snaith and co-workers have shown  that PSCs with   $\\mathsf{C}_{60}$  -modified   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   can significantly enhance  electron transfer and result in a largely improved performance  of   $17.3\\%$   and a decrease in hysteretic behavior. Petrozza and  co-workers demonstrated that insufficient charge extraction  from the perovskite film to the ETL can be remedied using a   $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}/\\mathrm{PCBM}$   bilayer ETL, and a PCE of   $17.9\\%$   was achieved.   Recently, Choi and co-workers achieved a PCE of   $21.1\\%$   using   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}@\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\\;\\mathrm{ETL},^{[20]}$  ]  and Kong and co-workers showed a PCE of   $21.4\\%$   using the same type of ETL.  Numerous other efforts  have been undertaken to enhance the performance of PSCs  with bilayer ETLs, such as   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}@\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  ,    $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P C B M}$  ,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/3743f6faa2f93e050b8989b5a8746f8ff99393d19b48cc9d9ca22d9e9dc9df7a-1727127475.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   The surface morphology of ITO and deposited films. a–d) Top-view SEM images of ITO,   $\\mathsf{I T O}/\\mathsf{I n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$  ,   $|\\mathsf{T O}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  , and   $\\mathsf{I T O}/\\mathsf{I n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  ,  respectively.

In contrast, the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  of PSCs generally depends  to a large extent on the energy level of the ETL for a specific  bandgap material. Well-matched energy alignment between  the ETL and perovskite films enhances charge transfer, and  reduces inter facial recombination for efficient PSCs.  Therefore, controlling the energy level of the ETL is also beneficial for  improving the performance of PSCs. However, planar devices  are still less efficient than mesoporous devices.  \n\nHere, we introduce a simple low-temperature solutionprocessed   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   bilayer ETL for efficient planar PSCs.  We demonstrate that uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films  can be obtained by the introduction of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  . The band energy  alignment can be also tailored with increased built-in potential,  resulting in an enhanced electric field for the separation of carriers and enhanced charge transfer, as well as reduced carrier  recombination. The planar PSC utilizing  $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ETL demonstrated a higher efficiency of   $23.24\\%$   with negligible hysteresis and  \nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
