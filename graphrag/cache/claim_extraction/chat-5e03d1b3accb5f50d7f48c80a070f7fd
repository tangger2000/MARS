against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Copyright 2016, The Royal Society of Chemistry.  \n\nYi et al. reported the mixing of   $C s^{+}$   into the   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$   system.   In their system,   $C s^{+}$   and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   were added in   $20\\%$   and   $80\\%$   fractions, respectively, to the HMHP. They found that the very  stable  α / δ -phases of   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   were formed. The   $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$   structure comprises 1D pillars consisting of facesharing   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedra, as shown in Figure  1c. In the case  of   $\\delta{\\mathrm{-}}{\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{Pb}}_{3}$  , the structure also contains 1D   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{3}$   pillars surrounded by   $C s^{+}$  cations, but there are stacked and shifted-edge-sharing   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedra, unlike those in   $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$  , as  shown in Figure 1d. The   $\\alpha\\mathrm{\\mathrm{-}}$   and   ${\\beta}{\\mathrm{{F}A P b I_{3}}}$   phases  shown in  Figure  1e,f are slightly similar to that of   $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}{\\sim}\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  , as shown  in Figure  1g. In this mixed-cation HMHP system, the energetically very unfavorable   $\\delta$  phase is proposed to improve the  stability of the HMHP material, because of the entropic gains  and consequently large energetic compensation. The sum of  the energy and enthalpy of mixing of the   $\\alpha\\cdot$   and   $\\beta$  phases can  reduce the Gibbs free energy, as shown in Figure 1h. As summarized in the energy versus  $C s^{+}$   fraction plot, the formation of  the separate   $\\delta$  phase HMHP material with enhanced stabilization occurs at   $40–60\\%$   $C s^{+}$   fraction.  \n\nBased on these theoretical and partially practical investigations, an important phenomenon must be considered, that is,  the formation of a single, pure crystal phase does not occur.  For example,   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   thin films have been reported to show  the transformation of the tetragonal phase (identified by X-ray  diffraction (XRD)) into two different crystal phases: partial  tetragonal and cubic phases.  Therefore, the performance  of solar cells depends on the contributions from pure HMHP  crystals and multi crystalline as well as charge transfer/interaction. Notably,   $C s^{+}$   and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   mixed   $\\mathrm{APbI}_{3}$   HMHP materials  where   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cations, owing to fragmentation; this is discussed  in Section  3.2. The presence of a thermodynamic ally stable  minor   $\\delta\\mathrm{{Cs}P b I_{3}}$   phase that is larger than the major   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\mathrm{\\mathrm{-}F A P b I}_{3}$    phase is important. This   $\\delta{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   phase could prevent the  second reaction after the formation of the HMHP film, owing  to the thermal dissociation of the impurities and halides on  the   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atoms, under steady-state condition. Therefore, it may  not induce defect/ion migrations on the   $\\delta{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   phase, and  thus may prevent the second reaction between   $\\delta{\\mathrm{-}}{\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{Pb}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathscr{\\alpha}\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$  . Hence, a suitable approach for the development of  more stable HMHP devices is to search for new components  instead of using  $C s^{+}$  cations or other rare earth elements.  \n\n# 2.2. Temperature-Dependent Crystal Phase Transition  \n\n$\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   is the most popular HMHP material for thin film solar  cell applications, and exhibits a PCE of close to   $20\\%$  .  This  material, having the   $\\mathrm{MAMX}_{3}$   structure, is easy to prepare from  starting materials, for use as a precursor in solar cell fabrication. In particular, the  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   system has been used as a model  to identify the properties of these materials in detail.  In  many studies on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  ,  the crystal phases and their  transitions have been investigated at different temperatures  to determine the temperature dependence of the structure,  which is related to the thermal stability, and must be known  for real-world applications. The ortho rhombi c ( Pnma ), tetragonal ( I 4/ mcm ),  and cubic   $(P m{\\cdot}3m)^{[32,49-51]}$   phases  exist between 20 and 150 K, 180 and   $280~\\mathrm{K},$  , and 320 and   $350~\\mathrm{K}$  ,  respectively. The experimental results of these crystal phase  transitions are summarized along with their pseudo cubic lattice  parameters based on classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in  Figure   2 . The crystal phase transitions of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   are  similar to those of other inorganic perovskite materials. It is notable that a complementary relationship between the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  cation and the inorganic octahedral cage of   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$  , and the  dynamic order–disorder of these components can lead to a  crystal phase transition.  \n\nOf the three structural phases (ortho rhombi c   $\\rightarrow$  tetragonal   $\\rightarrow$  cubic) of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  , the ortho rhombi c phase contains fully  ordered   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cations in a fully disordered   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedral inorganic cage. This was revealed by using partially deuterated  $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  cations;  shorter   $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$   bonds and a greatly distorted   $\\mathrm{I-Pb-I}$  bond angle were observed. The tetragonal and cubic phases  have been attributed to partially and fully disordered   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cations in inorganic cages, respectively. Furthermore, the arrangement of the inorganic   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedral corner-shared framework  depends on the crystal phase transitions from cubic to tetragonal and ortho rhombi c, as shown in Figure 1g–i. In the structural phase transitions, the corner-sharing   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedra and  their rotations must remain out-of-phase in directions perpendicular to the rotation axis but remain in-phase in directions  parallel to this axis. These transitions affect the Brillouin zone  (BZ) boundaries of the cubic unit cell. The out-of-phase and inphase rotations are at the R-point   $(1/2\\;1/2\\;1/2,\\,\\mathrm{R}_{4}{}^{+})$   and M-point \n\n  $(1/2\\ 1/2\\ 0,\\:\\mathrm{M}_{3}{}^{+})$  . The cubic–tetragonal transition occurs via the \n\n  $\\mathrm{R}_{4}^{\\mathrm{~+~}}$   rotational distortion mode, and the tetragonal–ortho rhombi c  transition is mainly associated with a combination of the   ${\\mathrm{R}}_{4}^{\\,\\,+}$  and   ${{\\bf{M}}_{3}}^{+}$   distortion modes.
