Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

Other catalysts were prepared by similar  methods.  \n\nElectrochemical Testing : OER and HER performance of the catalysts  in the electrolyte   $(\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\mathsf{I}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!)\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\subset\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\mathsf{M}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!(\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\mathsf{K O H}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!)\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!$   were conducted in a standard threeelectrode electrochemical cell controlled by a CHI 760D electrochemical  workstation. The saturated   $\\mathsf{A g}|\\mathsf{A g C}|$  , graphite rod and perovskite/Ni  foam served as the reference electrode, counter electrodes and working  electrode, respectively. OER polarization curves gained from linear  sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded at a scan rate of   $5\\,\\textrm{\\textmu\\textmu\\textmu}\\,{\\sf s}^{-1}$  from 0.2 to   $0.9\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus   $\\mathsf{A g}|\\mathsf{A g C}|$  , and HER polarization curves was  recorded from   $-1.1$   to   $-2.1\\ \\lor$   versus   $\\mathsf{A g}|\\mathsf{A g C}|$   corrected by iR corrected.  Tafel slopes were measured by replotting the polarization curves that  over potential   $(\\eta)$   versus the logarithm of current density (log  | J | ). The  durability of OER performance was tested at  $0.53~\\lor$   versus Ag | AgCl (for  OER). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was applied to assess the  electrochemical double-layer capacitance   $(\\mathsf C_{\\mathsf{d}1})$   for OER from   $-0.5\\ \\lor$  to   $-0.3\\ \\lor.$   The   ${\\mathsf{C}}_{\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{I}}$   was derived by the slopes of the halves of charging  current density difference at the center of the scanning potential range  versus scan rates. The overall water electrolysis tests were conducted  in   $]\\texttt{M}\\mathsf{K O H}$   using a two-electrode configuration with different catalysts.  The durability measurements were conducted by chrono potenti ome try  tests under a constant current density of   $10\\,\\,\\mathsf{m A}\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   for  $10~\\mathrm{{h}}$  .  \n\nSolar Evaporation Performance Tests : Solar steam generation  experiments were performed under a solar simulator (CEL-PE300L-3A)  \n\nequipped with AM   $1.5\\,\\mathrm{~G~}$   optical filter. The solar flux was controlled  to   $100\\,\\,{\\sf m W}\\,\\,{\\sf c m}^{-2}$  , and the mass changes of water were recorded by a  high-accuracy balance. The per ovsk ites/NF composites were floated on  the water under light irradiation. Meanwhile, the surface temperature  distribution of catalysts and water was monitored by an infrared  thermal imager (E8, FLIR). The ambient temperature and humidity were  maintained at  $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  and  $\\approx\\!50\\%$   RH, respectively.  \n\nMaterials Characterization : XRD diffract o meter (Ultima IV, Rigaku)  was used to obtain the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for  crystallographic identification, which was operated at   $40\\;\\mathrm{~\\textperthousand~}$  and   $30~\\mathsf{m A}$  with   $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K}\\alpha$   radiation. Combined with the Rietveld refinements  using GSAS software, more detailed information on the crystalline  structure was analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy measurements  were performed with a field emission scanning electron microscopy  (SEM, JEOL JSM-7600F). For further investigation of the morphology  and elemental identification, high-resolution transmission electron  microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) with an accelerating voltage of   $200~\\mathrm{kV}$  was employed. The wet t ability property of the composite surface  was characterized using a contact angle meter (KRUSS, DSA100). The  surface chemical states of catalysts before and after electro catalysis were  investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi,  Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with  $\\mathsf{A l{-K}\\alpha}$  radiation and data were  fitted by the XPSPEAK software. The solar absorption   $(\\alpha)$   properties of  the catalysts were determined by the diffuse reflection ( R ) spectra using  a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PE). The absorptivity  was calculated by the equation   $\\alpha={\\mid-R={\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{300}^{2500}\\!I(\\lambda)({\\mid}-R(\\lambda))}{\\displaystyle\\int_{300}^{2500}\\!I(\\lambda)d\\lambda}}}$  ,  where   $\\lambda$   is the wavelength.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.L., H.Z., Y.W., and X.Z. contributed equally to this work.
