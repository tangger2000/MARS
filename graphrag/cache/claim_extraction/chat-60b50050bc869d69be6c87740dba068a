The stabilized  efficiency of   $20.5\\%$   (Figure S30, Supporting Information) over   $200\\;\\mathrm{s}$   at the maximum power output further validated the performance of the mesoporous (CsFAMA)Pb  $(\\mathrm{BrI})_{3}$  -PSCs with   $\\mathrm{ZnO-}$   $\\mathrm{MgO{-}E A^{+}}$   ETLs. To demonstrate the need to introduce   $\\mathrm{EA^{+}}$   for  achieving high efficiencies of mesoporous PSCs, we fabricated  mesoporous (CsFAMA)  $\\mathrm{Pb(BrI)}_{3}\\mathrm{.PSC}$   devices with only ZnO  and   $\\mathrm{ZnO-MgO}$   without EA modification as ETLs. The results  indicated that the PSCs with   $\\mathrm{ZnO}_{-}\\mathrm{MgO}_{-}\\mathrm{EA}^{+}$   ETLs displayed  much enhanced cell performances (Figure S31 and Table S4,  Supporting Information). Moreover, mesoporous (CsFAMA)  $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{BrI})_{3}$  -PSCs with   $\\mathrm{ZnO}_{-}\\mathrm{MgO}_{-}\\mathrm{EA}^{+}$  ETLs also outperformed  the devices with\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
