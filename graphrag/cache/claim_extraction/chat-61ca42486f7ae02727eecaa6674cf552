Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

On the other hand, the high conductivity of  the carbon fibers support could enhance the electron transfer  for the NiCo alloy nano particle, alleviate the aggregation of  the nanoparticles and accelerate the ions transport during  ORR and OER processes. The ORR process stability was  measured in   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   -saturated   $0.1\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$   KOH at half-wave potential  under a rotating rates of   $1600~\\mathrm{rpm}$   for   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and NiCo  $_{\\mathrm{{'@N.C}}}$    2, and the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   has also been tested under the  same condition for better comparison, the results are shown  in  Figure   5 a. After   $^{\\mathrm{~7~h~}}$  continuous operation,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}2$    exhibits the best ORR long-term stability and the plot of stability is nearly a straight line, which is superior to   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and  the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   catalyst. The residual current percentages of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$  , NiC  $\\mathsf{o}\\!\\left(\\varnothing\\mathrm{N}\\!\\!\\cdot\\!\\!\\mathsf{C}\\;2\\right)$  , and commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   are   $81.2\\%$  ,   $90.4\\%$  , and   $53.4\\%$  , respectively. Furthermore, long-term  st abilities of OER process for   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NiC}o@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\,2$  , and the com  mercial   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   were also tested at   $1.71~\\mathrm{V}$   (vs RHE) in   $\\Nu_{2}$  -saturated   $0.1\\ \\mathrm{M\\KOH}$   under a rotating rates of   $1600~\\mathrm{rpm}$  , and the  results are displayed in Figure 5b. After   $7\\mathrm{~h~}$   continuous measurement, the current of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}\\hat{\\lambda}$  2 still keeps at around \n\n  $2.57\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}$  , which is much larger than the current of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   \n\n  $(0.34~\\mathrm{mA})$   and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$     $(2.33\\mathrm{~mA})$  ). The residual current percentages of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$  , and commercial   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   are   $64.1\\%$  ,   $79.5\\%$  , and   $75.0\\%$  , respectively. Again,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N\\!\\cdot\\!C}\\ \\}$  2 displays  the best OER stability. In addition, after  $7\\mathrm{~h~}$  continuous operation, we collected the samples on the glassy carbon electrode  both after ORR and OER bulk electrolysis (BE) processes, and  characterized with SEM, respectively. The SEM images of   $\\mathrm{NiC}o@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\;2$   after 7 h testing for ORR and OER st abilities are  shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. After   $7\\mathrm{~h~}$    BE testing for ORR and OER processes, the morphology and  structure of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$   have almost no change. For ORR  BE, after 7 h testing, NiCo alloy nanoparticles are still decorated on the N-doped carbon nanofibers uniformly and the  diameter is also about   $50~\\mathrm{nm}$   as before. Meanwhile, N-doped  carbon nanofibers (  $({\\approx}100\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   in diameter as before) are still  continuous and separated well from each other. In addition,  there is no aggregation both for NiCo alloy nanoparticles and  carbon nanofibers. On the other hand, for the OER BE, the  morphology and structure of the   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$   have not been  changed a lot similarly. In conclusion, all of these above imply  that the sample   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$   exhibits outstanding st abilities  in   $0.1\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$   KOH solution for both ORR and OER processes and  the stability of carbon materials on both ORR and OER processes could be enhanced greatly, after decorated with suitable  amount of NiCo alloy nanoparticles.  \n\nThe outstanding ORR and OER electrochemical performances of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}\\hat{\\lambda}$   motivated us to investigate its feasibility as the air catalyst of primary zinc–air batteries.

The intrinsic resistance (  $R_{\\mathrm{f}},$   Table S1, Supporting Information)  of the catalysts decreases rapidly with the increasing of the  alloy nanoparticles mass loading, and   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   shows the  smallest catalyst resistance   $(6.9\\,\\,\\,\\Omega)$  . Furthermore, the charge  transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$   of   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   is also the smallest  one   $\\left(11.3\\ \\Omega\\right)$  , while   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   exhibits the largest charge transfer  resistance   $(438.0\\ \\Omega)$  . The both smallest catalyst resistance and  charge transfer resistance of NiCo  $@\\mathrm{N.C}$   2 may result from  its excellent morphology (moderate NiCo alloy nanoparticles  decorated on N-doped carbon nanofibers), nitrogen doping, and  synergistic effect between NiCo alloy nanoparticles and carbon  nanofibers. The significantly reduced intrinsic resistance and  charge transfer resistance of the hybrid catalysts are beneficial  to the enhanced OER activities and in good agreement with the  results in Figure 3c.  \n\nThe surface compositions of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\ \\,{\\gimel}$   are  further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  to get insightful chemical and structural information.
