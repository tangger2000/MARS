Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

The annealed samples finally form smooth,  relatively compact   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films with an average grain  size of   $253~\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure 2f provide information on the crystal structure of the three samples. As  shown,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film maintains the cubic phase even after  IPA washing and high temperature annealing. The loss or  weakening of some Bragg peaks indicates that the perovskite  shows octahedral tilts and rotations as the ligands are removed  and crystals grow.  Crystals within the annealed film are suggested to be highly oriented along the [100] and [110] direction.  The gradual narrowing of the Bragg peaks is observed as the  crystal size increases from SEM measurements. Time-resolved  PL (TRPL) spectroscopy was carried out on these   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  films. The results show that the PL lifetime tends to increase  with increasing crystal size (Figure   $2\\mathrm{g}.$  , Table S2, Supporting  Information), which is similar to previous reports.  \n\nMetallic Pb atoms can develop in perovskite and cause strong  exciton quenching,  and the charge recombination centers are  almost exclusively localized on the crystal surfaces rather than  in the bulk.  During the ligands removal process,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    films were soaked in the   $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{OAC})_{2}$   IPA solution. This results in  Pb atom-rich perovskite films (Figure S4, Supporting Information), and tends to have a high density of defect states. Optical  characterization in Figure 2b confirms the existence of surface  defects. As can be seen, the Stokes shift increases from   $18~\\mathrm{{nm}}$    in the as-prepared films to   $35~\\mathrm{nm}$   in the annealed ones. Since  the spontaneous radiative recombination between trap states  causes a red-shift in the PL peak compared with that from the  band edge transition,  the enhanced Stokes shift of the Pbrich  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film here clearly demonstrates the appearance of  surface defects.  \n\nDifferent pas siva ting agents such as fullerene,  nitrogendoped reduced graphene oxide,  the organic molecule iodopenta flu oro benzene,    $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  ,  thiophene, chlorine-capped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   colloidal NCs,  and pyridine Lewis bases  have been  employed to passivate surface charge trap states of the perovskite. Here, we find a simple but effective interface passivation method by using commercially available P3HT. A thin  P3HT film coated on the top of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film suppresses trap  states and thus considerably reduces interface recombination  at the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}/\\mathrm{P3HT}$   interface. Steady-state PL and TRPL  decay measurements were conducted to investigate the charge  recombination occurring at the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}/\\mathrm{P3HT}$   interface. An  excitation light of   $405\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   was used, which has a penetration  depth of   ${\\approx}30\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , much less than the thickness of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    films (  $.200\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  . As shown in  Figure   3 a, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film  without a P3HT layer had an emission peak at   $664\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , and was  independent of the incident light directions. As expected, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   layer passivated by P3HT   $(\\approx\\!5\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   had a blue-shifted  emission peak from 664 to   $658\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  . The Stokes shift of  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    decreased from 35 to   $29~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   with the help of P3HT, indicating  pass iv ation of the surface trap states of the perovskite film.   TRPL spectroscopy was performed to evaluate the dynamics of  charge carrier recombination in the perovskite film after introducing P3HT. The film PL decay curves in Figure 3b also confirm the reduction of trap states. P3HT pass iv ation causes the  average lifetime of  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films increased from 6.91 to 14.8 ns  (Table S2, Supporting Information). Since the PL decay time  of P3HT is well below 1 ns,  we consequently attribute the  enhanced PL lifetime to the pass iv ation of defect states.  \n\nElectronic structure calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) were performed to characterize how P3HT  polymer can passivate the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   surface. First, the sulfur (S)  atoms are found to bond with Cs atoms   $(\\mathrm{Cs}{-}\\mathrm{S};4.03\\ \\mathring{\\mathrm{A}})$   on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  (110) surface (Figure 3c) and passivate the inter facial  positively charged under-coordinated   $C s^{+}$   ions. In addition, S  atoms also boned to   $\\mathrm{Pb}$     $(\\mathrm{S-Pb};~3.36~\\mathring\\mathrm{A})$  ) atoms and passivated  the antisite defects (Figure 3d), known as deep-level defects  and the most detrimental defects in perovskite solar cells.   Without P3HT, the electron distribution was localized around  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/f7194f76a10a3c491e1a42a90ef537c517f970b42f359f0d393ecdb8e45f27ed-1727116039.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films with P3HT layer using a  $405\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   laser as the excitation source from the perovskite film side (blue curve), from the glass side (blue shadow), and  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films without P3HT from the perovskite film  side (red curve).
