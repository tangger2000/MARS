Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Contact angle measurements were  performed on an OCA20 instrument (Data-physics). Mass spectra  were obtained on a MAXIS LC-MS spectrometer. The AFM images were  acquired using a Veeco NanoScope IV with a silicon cantilever. XPS  analysis was performed using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB  250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The band structures of the perovskite  films were analyzed using UPS (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher).  Absorption spectra of perovskite films were characterized on a UV–vis  NIR spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics Instrument). PL (excitation at   $532\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathrm{m})$  ) spectra were investigated using an Edinburgh Instruments  Ltd. FLS980 spectrometer under   $510\\;\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   wavelength excitation, and  TRPL spectra were measured using a PicoQuant FluoQuant 300.   $J-V$    characteristics of the hybrid PSCs were measured using a solar simulator  (AM 1.5G, SAN-EIELECTRIC XES-40S2-CE) calibrated using a standard  silicon solar cell. All devices were tested in the reverse and forward scan  directions following standard procedures at a rate of   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mV\\s^{-1}}$  . EQE  spectra of the hybrid PSCs were measured using a   $\\mathsf{Q}$   Test Station 500TI  system (Crowntech, Inc. USA). The monochromatic light intensity was  adjusted using a reference silicon detector.  \n\nDensity Functional Theory Calculation : The Vienna Ab Initio simulation  package code  was used in the DFT calculation in the Perdew– Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation framework.  The Tkatchenko– Scheffler method was used to consider the van der Waals interaction.   The cell size, cut energy, and convergence condition in the calculation  were set to   $20\\times20\\times20\\;\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{3}$  , 500 and  $\\bar{10^{-6}}\\;{\\mathsf{e V}},$  , respectively, which ensured  high accuracy of the results. Charge density analysis was performed  using Bader code.  The core and valence electronic interactions were  described with the frozen-core projector augmented-wave potentials.  \n\nThe Kohn − Sham one-electron states were expanded in plane waves  with a kinetic energy of up to   $400~\\mathrm{eV}.$   The exchange correlation energy  was calculated with the PBE generalized gradient approximation.  The tolerance of   $10^{-5}$    eV was adopted for energy convergence of  electronic calculations. The   $\\mathsf{F A P b}|_{3}$   (001) surfaces were modeled using   $2\\times2$   slabs containing 8 atomic layers. The size of the supercell was   $17.93\\,\\times\\,17.93\\,\\times\\,50.40~^{\\circ}$  Å. A large vacuum thickness of   $26\\textup{\\AA}$   along the  direction normal to the surface was employed to separate surfaces from  their periodic images that are normal to the surface plane. The bottom  5 layers of atoms were kept fixed at their optimized bulk positions. All  other atoms were fully relaxed in three dimensions until the atomic  forces were smaller than   $0.2\\;\\mathrm{\\sf~eV~}\\;\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{-1}$  . The nonlocal van der Waals  interactions were evaluated with the vdw-DF functional of Langreth and  Lundqvist.
