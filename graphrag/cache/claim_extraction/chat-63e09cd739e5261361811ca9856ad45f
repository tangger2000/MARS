More importantly, the proposed devices exhibit a long half-lifetime of 238.5 min in a continuous current mode, demonstrating a good long-term stability in air ambient. It can be anticipated that this study will provide new insights into the design of novel white emitters and diodes for next-generation lighting technologies. We start with the first-principles calculations of thermodynamic stability and light-emission for copper-based ternary halides. Figure 1a shows the crystal structures of CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5, which are crystallized in orthorhombic crystal system with the space group of Cmcm (a=10.04 Å, b=13.05 Å, c=5.92 Å, and α=β=γ=90°) and Pnma (a=10.174 Å, b=11.653 Å, c=14.362 Å, and α=β=γ=90°), respectively. In both Cs3Cu2I5 and CsCu2I3, Cu+ is fourfold coordinated by I-, but the former consists of 0D isolated [Cu2I5]3- motifs and the latter is composed of 1D chain structure formed by edge-sharing [Cu2I3]- dimerized units. The thermodynamic phase stability calculations (Figure 1b) indicate that both Cs3Cu2I5 and CsCu2I3 are stable with respect to decomposition into binary CsI and CuI, which is well agreement with the experimental results in previous studies. The marginally stable condition of CsCu2I3 (on the convex hull) implies the possibility of its coexistence with the most stable Cs3Cu2I5 in single chemical reaction by deliberately controlling the material synthesis condition. This result actually motivated us to develop a facile one-step solution process to prepare the CsCu2I3@Cu3Cu2I5 composites, as demonstrated below. Some recent studies have theoretically and experimentally recognized that the emission of CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5 originates from the STEs, and discussed qualitatively the formation of STE in terms of electronic band structure and charge density of band-edge states. In present case, we further identified the lattice distortion pattern associated with the STE and explicitly calculated the STE related quantities. Figure 1c,d show the formation process of STE in CsCu2I3 and Cu3Cu2I5, where the exciton localization is accompanied by structural distortion, as illustrated in Figure S1, Supporting Information. Specifically, the calculated bond lengths of Cu1-Cu2 were shortened from 3.07 Å to 2.74 Å for CsCu2I3, while that for Cs3Cu2I5 was shortened from 2.50 Å to 2.34 Å. Meanwhile, the calculated I1-Cu1-I2 angle is increased from 108.6° to 128.6° for CsCu2I3, and 120.1° to 142.8° for Cs3Cu2I5. Nevertheless, the I3-Cu2-I4 angle is decreased from 123.2° to 117.4° for CsCu2I3, and 108.6° to 98.2° for Cs3Cu2I5. The calculated STE results are given in Table S1, Supporting Information, which shows reasonably good agreement with the experimentally measured values from the photoluminescence (PL) and absorption characteristics of CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5 materials, as seen in Figure 1e. The above results essentially provide in-depth understanding of the STE emission nature of the studied CsCu2I3@Cu3Cu2I5 composites system. The above results imply that the combination of yellow-emissive STE in CsCu2I3 and blue-emissive STE in Cs3Cu2I5 is promising for producing white-light emission. Meanwhile, there is a possibility that both two copper-based ternary halides can coexist by deliberately controlling the synthesis conditions. Motivated by the first-principles thermodynamic analysis, we then successfully synthesize the CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 composites by one-step spin-coating of the precursor solution with designed CsI/CuI molar ratios, and then annealing at 100°C on a hot plate, as illustrated in Figure 2a. Different from the previously reported strategies for white-light Cs-Cu-I system, the synthesis process of CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 composites in present case is convenient and facile, which reduces the preparation cost and simplifies the processing complexity, promising for practical device applications. Figure 2b shows the phase structural characteristics of the CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 composites, in which two groups of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks from orthorhombic CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5 systems can be observed (Figure S2, Supporting Information), revealing the coexistence of two phases.

For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.
