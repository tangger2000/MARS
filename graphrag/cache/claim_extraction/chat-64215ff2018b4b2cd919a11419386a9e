Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Finally, a   $100\\;\\mathsf{n m\\,A g}$   counter electrode was thermally evaporated on the surface of the Spiro-OMeTAD ﬁlms under a vacuum of  $3\\times\\dot{\\mid}0^{-4}$    Pa by using a shadow mask. For the devices used for the stability test, an  $80\\;\\mathsf{n m\\,A u}$   counter electrode was thermally evaporated.  \n\nCharacterization : UV–vis absorption measurement was performed using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and grazing incidence X-ray diﬀraction (GIXRD) patterns were obtained on a P ANalytical Empyrean (Netherlands). 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) images were collected on BL1W1A at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF)   $(\\lambda=1.54\\mathrm{\\AA}$  ). The incidence angle is   $0.16^{\\circ}$   and the exposure time is   $\\ 100\\ s$  . Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained by using a ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7800F, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) measurements were carried out on a Thermo–Fisher ESCALab   $250\\times\\mathrm{i}$   system with a mono chroma ti zed Al  ${\\sf K}_{\\alpha}$  (for XPS mode) under the pressure of   $5.0\\times\\,10^{-7}$    Pa. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo– Fisher Nicolet iS50 Infrared Fourier transform microscope. PL Mapping spectra were collected through a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, France) under an excitation of  $532\\;\\mathsf{n m}$  .  $J^{-V}$  curves in forward scan (FS, from    $-0.1$   to 1.2 V) and reverse scan (RS, from 1.2 to  − 0.1 V) were obtained using a solar simulator equipped (150 W, SolarIV-150A) with a Keithley 2400 source meter. Light intensity was calibrated to AM 1.5G one sun   $(100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  ) using a NIM calibrated standard Si solar cell (QEB1). The black metal masks were used to deﬁne the eﬀective active area of devices   $(0.1\\ c m^{2})$  ). Time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) and steadystate photo luminescence (SSPL) spectra were measured by an Edinburgh FLS1000 (UK), where the excitation wavelength of TRPL was provided by a  $450\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   laser. TPV and TPC measurements were performed as follows: the devices were illuminated with a laser pulses (  $532\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  ,   $100~\\mathsf{m}$  J, 6 ns width from an Nd:YAG laser), and then the decay of signals was collected through a   $\\rceil\\subset\\!\\mathsf{H}z$   Agilent digital oscilloscope (DSO-X3102A) with the input impedance of   $]\\ M\\Omega/50\\,\\Omega$  . Impedance spectroscopy was measured on an Electrochemical Workstation (China) and the data were processed using the Z-View program. An IPCE measurement system was used to measure the incident photon-to-electron conversion eﬃciency (IPCE). The contact angle goniometer (YIKE-360A model; Chengde Precision Test Instrument Factory, China) was employed to measure the contact angles.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was ﬁnancially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62274018) and the Support plan for Overseas Students to Return to China for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (cx2023006).  \n\n# Conﬂict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.  \n\n# Data Availability Statement  \n\nResearch data are not shared.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\nchiral molecule, defect pass iv ation, multilayer manipulation, perovskite solar cells, stress release  \n\nReceived: November 28, 2023 Published online: January 7, 2024  \n\n[3] Q.
