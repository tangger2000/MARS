It should be noted that thinner   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   scintilla tor film with similar X-ray absorptivity with the  GOS film also can be made by adjusting concentration of PNCs  in PMMA matrix. Accordingly, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor  exhibited the higher X-ray absorption efficiency than GOS scintillator. Light output power density and conversion efficiency  (light output power density/X-ray absorption) of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  PNCs and GOS scintilla tor film with dose rate was shown in  Figure 2b. The light output power density of both samples have  linear correlation with X-ray dose rate, but the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs  film was more sensitive to dose rate than the GOS one. Due to  the stronger emission of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs film than the GOS  sample at the same absorption, the PNCs film has higher conversion efficiency (light output power density   $(\\upmu\\mathrm{{W}\\ c m^{-2}})/\\mathrm{{X}\\mathrm{{-}\\mathrm{{r}a}}}$  y  absorption   $(\\upmu\\mathrm{Gy_{air}\\ s^{-1}})\\ x\\ 100)$   of   $45â€“49\\%$   than the GOS sample   $(10{-}24\\%)$  . The calculated light yields of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs and  GOS scintilla tor film from the equation (light yield   $=10^{6}/2.5$   $E_{\\mathrm{g}},$   where   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  is bandgap)  were   $177\\ 000$   and   $66~000$   photons   $\\breve{\\mathrm{MeV}}^{-1}$  , respectively. The light yield of GOS scintilla tor was consistent with the previous report.  We also placed a scintilla tor  on a commercial X-ray detector (remote redeye HR, Teledyne  Dalsa) with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and measured  the ADC output of the detector with respect to the X-ray dose  as shown in Figure 2c. The Si-photodiode s used in this experiment are 12 bits and the ADC can be represented as 0â€“4092.  The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor exhibited higher ADC value  than the GOS sample at the same dose rate. Accordingly, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{B}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor exhibits higher light output even at  low dose rate so that the radiation exposure to patient can be  greatly reduced than the conventional one.  \n\nAnother important performance of the X-ray detector is  the spatial resolution that can be determined by the modulation transfer function (MTF). It is the spatial frequency of the  output (in linepairs (lp) per millimeter (mm)), which represents the transfer capability of the input signal modulation. An  MTF value of 1 indicates the perfect detection of a given spatial  frequency. The slanted-edge method was used to measure the  MTF for a quantitative resolution value.  The MTF can be calculated from the average ADC value of the measured image  (red region) by X-ray dose with tube voltage   $(50\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~kV}}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{p}})$  /current  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/a96f80d8b92ff935b6e54995000b5a916134962334fd1820d3b11879a23b2b7c-1727118157.jpg)  \nFigure 3. â€‚ Photograph and X-ray images for non destructive inspection. a) Photograph of normal (left) and defective (right) ball-point pens with same  exterior feature, b,c) X-ray images of both ball-point pens taken by conventional GOS scintilla tor based X-ray detector, d,e) X-ray images taken by   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor based X-ray detector, f,g) X-ray images of ball-points pens taken by GOS (f) and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs (g) scintilla tors based X-ray  detectors with X-ray dose rate, and h,i) X-ray images of line chart taken by GOS (h) and  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs (i) scintilla tors based X-ray detector.  \n\n$(250\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A})$   as shown in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information.

The MTF of pristine Si-PDs,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs on  Si-PDs, and GOS scintilla tor on Si-PDs with spatial frequency  was shown in Figure 2d. The corresponding spatial resolutions  of Si-PDs,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs on Si-PDs, and GOS scintilla tor on  Si-PDs are 12.1, 9.8, and   $6.2~\\mathrm{p~mm^{-1}}$  , respectively. It is clear  that the new   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor is better than the conventional GOS sample and even better than a-Se direct-type  X-ray detector   $(4.8\\;\\mathrm{lp}\\;\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$   at  $\\mathrm{MTF}=0.2$  ).  \n\nWe compared the X-ray images obtained from the conventional GOS and the new   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor based  indirect X-ray PD as shown in  Figure   3 . For non destructive  X-ray image detection, we use two ball-point pens with same  features, but one has normal spring and the other has bad  spring inside the pen as shown in Figure 3a. The corresponding  X-ray images obtained by the GOS and PNCs scintilla tor were  shown in Figure 3bâ€“e. Both scintilla tors exhibited clear images  of inside structure and consequently distinguish good and bad  product by non destructive image detection. To compare the  resolution of both samples, we obtained the X-ray images with  the dose rate as shown in Figure 3f,g. These clearly confirm  that the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor can obtain high resolution  image at lower X-ray dose rate than the conventional GOS one.  For the qualitative resolution analysis of the two scintilla tors,  we compared the X-ray images of a linear chart made of   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   as  \n\nshown in Figure 3h,i and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. The target area of the resolution test consists of line pairs  with feature densities between 1.12 and   $16.6\\;\\mathrm{lp}\\;\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$   as shown  in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information and the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  PNCs and the GOS scintilla tor had the detection resolution of  up to 12.5â€“8.9 and   $6.3~\\mathrm{p~mm}^{-1}$  , respectively. These results are  consistent with the MTF results in Figure 2d. Finally, we also  checked the long-term st abilities of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor  by measuring the changes in X-ray images according to the  cumulative dose as shown in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information.
