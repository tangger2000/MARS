Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

On account of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   being unable to absorb enough light at longer wavelengths   $(>350\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  , weak emission is observed when undoped  sample is excited at   $370~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  . In contrast, doping   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   leads to   ${\\approx}240$   times enhanced emission with an approximate peak position (Figure S5, Supporting Information).  \n\nHerein,   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6}{:1\\%}$     $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$   is chosen to make further  analysis. The photo luminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum is  located at   $250{-}450~\\mathrm{nm}$  , which could be ascribed to the absorption of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   host   $(<\\!350\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$   and the   $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$  -related  absorption   $(>350\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) (Figure  1c). Under   $370\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   excitation,   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6}{:1\\%}$   Sb shows an emission band at   $660\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   with  a full width at half maxima (FWHM) of   $195\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   and a large  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/d3bd78fcde7f5325dbeaac806ad6bfd7095fc314413c20c4c4e589118f65b636-1727105126.jpg)  \nFigure   1.   a) XRD patterns of  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g l n C l}_{6}$   doped with different contents of   ${\\mathsf{S}}{\\mathsf{b}}^{3+}$  and a subtle shift of diffraction peak near  $24^{\\circ}$   toward lower angle. b) Normalized absorption spectra of the as-prepared  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g I n C l}_{6};\\!\\mathrm{x}\\%\\mathsf{S b}$     $(x=0$   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g I n C l}_{6};\\mathsf{I}\\%\\mathsf{S b}$  . d) PL  decay curve of  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g I n C l}_{6}{\\cdot}\\mathsf{I}\\%\\mathsf{S b}.$  . e) FWHM of PL spectra and (f) integrated  $\\mathsf{P L}$   intensity as well as the corresponding fitting curves versus temperature  of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g I n C l}_{6};\\mathsf{I}\\%\\mathsf{S b}$  .  \n\nStokes shift of   $290\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . The PL with wide FWHM and large  Stokes shift are typical features of STEs emission, in analogy  to the soft lattice DPs and layered   $\\mathrm{Pb}$  -based per ovsk ites.  The   ${\\sf S b}^{3+}$   doped  $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   exhibits strong emission with PLQY up  to  $32\\%$   at  $0.5\\%\\;\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$   doping concentration. To reveal the underlying mechanism of the broadband emission, time-resolved PL  spectrum was measured under   $370~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   excitation (Figure 1d).  The average decay lifetime is determined to be   $10.55~\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   and  such a long lifetime conforms to the STEs recombination  mechanism. Wavelength-dependent PL and PLE spectra were  also measured (Figure S6a,b, Supporting Information) to  confirm the luminescent center. No significant shift is found  in the PL and PLE spectra at various excitation and emission  wavelengths, which suggests that the red emission originates  from the same excited state. Besides, the PL intensity of emission at   $660~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   exhibits a linear dependence on the excitation  power density (Figure S7, Supporting Information), indicating  that this emission band is not from permanent defects but the  intrinsic STE emission center.  \n\nTemperature-dependent PL spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6}{:1\\%}$   Sb  were measured from 78 to   $338\\;\\mathrm{~K}.$   As shown in Figure S8a  (Supporting Information), the PL wavelength slightly blue  shifts from 680 to   $660\\ \\mathrm{~nm}$   with elevated temperature  (Figure S8b, Supporting Information). This abnormal PL blue  shift monotonically with increased temperature is ascribed to  the thermal lattice expansion.  With increasing temperature  from 78 to   $338\\;\\mathrm{~K~}$  , the decreased PL intensity and increased  FWHM agrees with the model that more phonons participation  exacerbates the non radiative recombination and strong electron-phonon coupling at high temperature. By fitting the experiment results, the calculated Huang-Phys factor (S) is 30.16  (Figure  1e). The large Huang-Rhys factor illustrates a strong  electron-phonon coupling effect and easy formation of STEs in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  :Sb.  In summary, this broad emission with large  stokes shift, long lifetime, and high  S  value is assigned to the  STEs emission, which most likely originates from strong JahnTeller distortion of  $[\\mathrm{degCl}_{6}]^{5-}$   octahedron in the excited state.   Besides, the exciton binding energy   $(E_{\\mathrm{b}})$   of this   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  :Sb  is   $66.53\\,\\mathrm{\\meV}$   (Figure  1f), which is higher than the thermal  energy at room temperature   $(26~\\mathrm{meV})$  , implying the formation  of stable STEs with highly localization behavior.  \n\nTo further unveil the effect of   $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$   doping on the electronic  structure and photo physics process of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   DP, the  projected density of states (DOS) and optical transition energies were calculated based on density functional theory (DFT).
