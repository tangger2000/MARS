Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

During our hydrothermal synthesis,   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   was  oxidized to   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   by the trace amount of oxygen in the solution, thus always providing a strong   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}{-}p o o r/S n^{2+}}.$  -rich reac- tion condition facilitating the incorporation of   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   into the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   host. This explanation is further supported by a control experiment by intentionally using substantially less   $\\mathrm{{dnCl}_{4}}$  for the synthesis and producing luminescent products (see  Figure S6 in the Supporting Information for more details).  Moreover, the   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   substitution model (and related complex  that will be discussed later) explains the observed small lattice expansion by the Bi doping from XRD results; Figure S7  (Supporting Information) indicates   $\\mathrm{Bi_{i}}$   should increase  the lattice parameter by   $0.25\\%$  , while   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$  do  little, explaining well the experimental variation of the lattice  parameter.  \n\nThe Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$   dependence of   $\\Delta H$   in Figure S8  (Supporting Information) indicates that   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   can hardly be  ionized and keeps the neutral state at the equilibrium Fermi  level   $(E_{\\mathrm{F,e}})$  , because its   $(0/1+)$   and   $(0/1-)$   transition levels  are located deep in the bandgap at   $2.84~\\mathrm{eV}$   below the CBM  and   $1.66~\\mathrm{eV}$   above the host VBM, respectively. However, if  we consider a simple   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   model, it forms a half-occupied  localized band at   $1.25\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   above the host VBM for non-spinpolarized calculation (Figure S9a, Supporting Information).  The spin-polarized calculation would provide a more reliable result and indicate that the localized band is spin-split  to an occupied band at   $0.78\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   and an unoccupied band at   $1.76~\\mathrm{~eV~}$   above the VBM (Figure S9b, Supporting Information), giving total energy   $0.22~\\mathrm{eV}$   more stable than the nonspin-polarized case. It can provide a reasonable optical absorption from the occupied state to the host CBM at   $3.17\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  being reasonable agreement with the experimental defect  absorption at   $375\\ \\mathrm{nm}\\ (3.3\\ \\mathrm{eV})$  . However, the calculation result  also predicts another absorption from the host VBM to the  unoccupied state at   $1.76~\\mathrm{eV}$     $(705\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) but it is not detected  in the measured optical absorption in Figure 2a. A plausible  approach to explain all these experimental results is to consider that the unoccupied state is filled with electrons, e.g., due  to the formation of other defects. For example, as discussed  in Figure 5b, simultaneous formation of   $\\mathrm{V_{Cl}}$  along with   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$  (i.e., defect complex) has almost the same   $\\Delta H$   as a simple  substitution   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$  . Further, as   $\\mathrm{V_{Cl}}$   provides an extra electron to  fill the unoccupied state for the simple   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   model, leading to  the fully occupied non-spin-polarized defect band, as seen in  Figure 5d. This case provides only one optical absorption at   $3.05~\\mathrm{eV}$   from the defect band to the host CBM, which explain  the experimental defect optical absorption at   $3.3\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   and the  absence of the absorption from the host VBM to the defect  band. Therefore,   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$  -based defect complex such as   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$  would be the most possible state for the incorporated Bi in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  . This defect complex   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l},}}$   which could also be  viewed as   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$  , is proposed as the luminescent centers,  as evidenced by the necessary involvement of two activation  energies in the fitting of temperature dependent PL. The formation of   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$  , similar to the   $[\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}]^{2-}$  , combined with the  \n\ndefect tolerance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  , also explaining the crystal structure stability upon a few percentages of Bi alloying.  \n\nHere, we like to discuss more details in the electronic  structure of pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   and Bi-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   with   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   defect complex in Figure 5c,d. For pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  ,  the VBM is derived from   $\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
