Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type.

TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Based on this modified two-step process, a high PCE  of   $20.1\\%$   was obtained.  As can be seen, the fullerene and its  derivatives are also efficient ETM for PSCs, the performance of  PSCs based on fullerene derivatives is comparable to that of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  based PSCs. Furthermore, high quality fullerene and its derivatives can be fabricated by low temperature solution process,  which is favorable to reduce the cost. However, electron mobility  in C60 film is about   $1\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   and that of PCBM is   $2.6\\times$   $10^{-4}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , both of which are lower than that of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  . On the other hand, the position of valence band of fullerene and  its derivatives   $(-6.3\\,\\mathrm{~eV}$   for C60,   $-6.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for PCBM, compared  with vacuum energy level) is higher than that of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$     $(-8.0\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  compared with vacuum energy level), which leads to a weaker  hole blocking ability.  Additionally, according to the research  of Bao et al., the fullerene part of PCBM molecules interacts with  oxygen and water, which results in device degradation.  \n\n$\\mathrm{ZnO}$   is another widely used ETM, which has attracted much  attention as an alternative to  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   in DSSCs and poly­ mer solar  cells. Recently,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   based PSCs have also been researched  systematically. Although the best PCE of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   based PSCs  is about   $17\\%$  , which is inferior to that of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   based PSCs,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   is still an efficient and promising alternative to   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  in PSCs.

Second,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   is easy to crystallize and dope. At the  same time, the layered structure of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   crystal structure, like  shown in Figure 2c, leads to a different growth rates along  different directions, as a result, various ZnO nano structures,  such like nanowires,  nanotubes,  nanobelts,   nanorings,  nano flowers,  nanorods, and so on,   can be fabricated easily. Last but not least, high temperature annealing is not necessary for most ZnO fabrication  methods, which means that it can be produced with a lower  cost and thermal budget and thus be potentially used in flexible devices. These properties make   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   a promising ETM for  PSCs. Meanwhile, although most physical properties of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$    and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   are similar, there are also some distinct properties  for each material. As a result, studies on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   based solar cells  enrich the family of PSCs, which will in turn help to improve  the performance of PSCs.  \n\nIn this article, we briefly summarized the common fabrication methods of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   materials and systematically reviewed the  application of various types of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs in PSCs. The review  shows the origin of different performances between  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM  based PSCs and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   based PSCs. The important role of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$    ETM preparation and optimization in solar cell performance  is introduced. In addition, limitations of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs are also  discussed. This review tends to present a timely update on the  recent development of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based PSCs and provides  some guidelines for further optimization and design of PSCs  based on  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs and beyond.  \n\n# 2. Planar PSCs with a Compact ZnO Film   as the ETM  \n\nAs well known, perovskite materials have a long carrier diffusion length and ambipolar behavior. In other words, perovskite  materials can efficiently transport both electrons and holes.  This indicates that planar structure PSC is feasible. A simpler  solar cell structure without the mesoporous layer opens opportunities for potential applications of PSCs in tandem solar cell  and flexible devices. Thanks to the high mobility of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , to  date, planar PSCs with a compact   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film as the ETM have  been widely studied.  \n\nTo achieve high performance PSCs, a uniform and thin   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  film with low density of defects and pinholes is essential. The  usually used  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   compact films are prepared by radio frequency  (RF) sputtering. RF sputtering method is a vacuum coating technology and its working processes are shown in Figure 2d. A gas,  usually argon, is purged into a vacuum chamber. Under a high  frequency and high voltage electric field, it forms high energy  ion flow. The ionized gas particles bombard a target and materials sputtered off the target deposited on a substrate and form  a film made of the target material. The important parameters  influence the product properties include composition and purity  of target, work gas pressure, ratio of different work gases, RF  power and so on. By optimizing these parameters, a high quality   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film with high transmittance and good electronic properties can be obtained.  Because of the high energy coating  process and vacuum coating process, the adhesion between the  film and substrate is steady and the quality of the product film  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/56f5e971f1b3d7a419470593380a93977fbddc731d3912bc208f94d76766575f-1727115111.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $Z\\mathsf{n O}.10\\%$   film, and e,f) ZnO $20\\%$   film. g) Low magnification cross-section view of a perovskite film deposited on the  $Z\\mathsf{n O}{\\cdot}20\\%$   film. h) The  $J^{-V}$   curves of PSCs based on ZnO-Ar,   $Z\\mathsf{n O}.10\\%$  , and  $Z\\mathsf{n O}{\\cdot}20\\%$   films. i) Dark current voltage characteristics of solar cells based on ZnO-Ar,  $Z\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
