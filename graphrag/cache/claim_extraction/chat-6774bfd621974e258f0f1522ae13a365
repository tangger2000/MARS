Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The deposition of  the uniform PMMA layer on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs film strongly  improves the quality of the next-stage-grown pentacene film.  \n\nThe UV–visible absorption spectra of pentacene,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$  PMMA, and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}/$  /pentacene are depicted in  Figure 1h. The pentacene film exhibits strong absorption at 630  and   $680\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   while the absorption peak of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}$   is  mainly located in the UV region   $\\approx\\!500$   nm. The charge-transfer  efficiency was investigated by the steady-state photo lu minescence (PL).  As shown in Figure 1i, with excited by   $400\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  photo signal,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}$   film and the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}/$  pentacene film both emit sharp emission peak which is centered at   $515~\\mathrm{nm}$  . However, with the combination of pentacene  and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$  , the PL intensity becomes weaker or  even quenching which is originated from the radiative transfer  between the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   and pentacene, indicating highly  effective splitting of excitons has been achieved.  \n\nPL decay dynamics are fitted with the double-exponential  function to obtain fluorescent lifetime parameters.  According  to the mean lifetime calculation equation   $\\tau\\,=\\,{\\Sigma_{i}A_{\\mathrm{i}}\\tau_{\\mathrm{i2}}}/{\\Sigma_{i}A_{\\mathrm{i}}\\tau_{\\mathrm{i}}},$  where  $\\tau_{\\mathrm{i}}$   is lifetime constant and   $A_{\\mathrm{i}}$   is the corresponding weight  factor. The fast and slow components of PL lifetime, which are  related to the non radiative and radiative recombination, respectively,  can be extracted as   $\\tau_{1}=2.27$   ns and   $\\tau_{2}=8.23$   ns, and   $\\tau_{1}=1.41$   ns and   $\\tau_{2}=5.16$   ns for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   layer and  CsPbBr 3 /PMMA/pentacene film.  The longer lifetime of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   is consistent with its stronger fluorescence  intensity. The fast exciton separation at the interface between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   hybrid film and pentacene matrix is related  to the shorter lifetime of excitons at the interface between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   and pentacene.  \n\nThe output curves of the field effect transistor (FET) based  flash memory measured under the dark condition and with  light illumination are illustrated in  Figure   2 a.  Both the gate  voltage and the incident light can be utilized to modulate the  transport of charge carriers in the semiconducting channel.  The linear and saturation regions clearly prove the typical  p-type behavior of the transistor. The output curves appear linearly under the low bias as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting  Information), which indicates good ohmic contact between the  pentacene and the Au source–drain electrodes.
