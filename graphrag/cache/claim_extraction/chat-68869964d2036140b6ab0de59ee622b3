More notably, room-temperature ferro electricity  and X-ray detection property have been very recently achieved  in hybrid bromide double perovskite ferroelectric (chloroprop ylammonium  $\\mathrm{_{4}A g B i B r_{8}}$   (Curie temperature   $[T_{\\mathrm{c}}]=305~\\mathrm{K},$   spontaneous polarization   $[P_{\\mathrm{s}}]=3.2~\\upmu\\mathrm{C}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and sensitivity value of   $0.8\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\cdot\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  .  This work sheds new light on achieving  ferroelectric and photosensitive multi functional materials  based on lead-free halide double per ovsk ites. However, compared with the lead-based counterparts,  the lead-free halide  double perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors are faced with  two imminent tasks for further improvement in ferro electricity \n\n (such as high   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$   and larger   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$  ) and op to electronic performance \n\n (high sensitivity in X-ray detection). After systematically studying previously reported lead halide perovskite ferroelectric  semiconductors, we were inspired by two aspects that are key  to better performance. First, structural features of organic cations play a key role for ferroelectric performance. For example,  those templated by ring-like organic cation exhibit higher   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$    than those templated by chain-like organic cations (Figure S1,  Supporting Information). Second, the halide in the inorganic  layer should play another important role for op to electronic  performance, because the iodide species help achieve higher  X-ray attenuation than the bromides or chlorides for conventional lead halide per ovsk ites. However, ferro electricity has  not been achieved in 2D lead-free iodide double perovskite  ferroelectric s. In this context, we constructed a novel lead-free  iodide perovskite ferroelectric:   $(\\mathrm{DFPIP})_{4}\\mathrm{AgBiI}_{8}$  (1) (DFPIP \n\n  $=4.4$  -di flu oro pipe ridin i um). As expected, 1 exhibits a high   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$   \n\n (422 K), a large   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$     $(10.5~\\upmu\\mathrm{C}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  , and promising sensitivity of   $188~\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\cdot\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . Here, we describe the excellent ferroelectricity and X-ray detection properties in 1.  \n\n# 2.
