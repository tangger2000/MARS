For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized.

Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.

The   $E_{\\mathsf{a}}$   of ion conduction  represents how easily ions migrate and can be obtained from  the dependence of conductivity on the temperature in perovskite films.  The   $E_{\\mathsf{a}}$   in the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   perovskite films is  fitted to be  $0.41~\\mathrm{eV}_{\\ast}$  , which is larger than that in   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   (0.29 eV),  indicating the significant suppression of ion migration and,  thus, the reduction of hysteresis. In addition, the contribution to hysteresis reduction from fewer inter facial defects at  the ETL/perovskite interface and from fewer bulk defects due  to the ­ uniform and highly crystallized perovskite films cannot  be ruled out.  TRPL mapping was used to characterize the  inter facial defects at the ETL/perovskite interface in a largescale scan of   $10~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}\\times10~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   on the perovskite films grown on   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs ETLs (Figure S10, Supporting Information).  The reduced and uniform charge extraction times were  observed at the ETL/perovskite interface after the RCQs modification, indicating that the defects at the interface in a large area  were remarkably reduced, thus contributing to the reduction of  hysteresis. The uniform charge extraction time was also consistent with the results of the GIXRD line scan (Figure 3d,e). To  determine the bulky trap density of perovskite films grown on   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$  , we employed the space charge limited  current method by calculating the equation  \n\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}{e L^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere  $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity,  $\\varepsilon$  of 46.9 for the perovskite  is adopted,    $e$   is the electron charge, and   $L$   is the thickness of  the film. As shown in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), the  defect densities of perovskite films grown on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  - RCQs ETLs are   $1.44\\times10^{16}$   and   $8.5\\bar{1}\\times10^{15}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  , respectively.  The reduced bulk defect densities make the film more conductive and help to reduce the recombination of carriers, which is  beneficial to reduce the hysteresis.  \n\nTo verify these performance achievements, we plotted the  stabilized photo current and steady PCE for the PSCs based  on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   at the maximum power point   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{max}}\\,\\approx\\,1.0\\,\\mathrm{~V~}\\right.$  )  in Figure  4d. The steady-state output can reach a PCE of \n\n  $21.50\\%$   with a steady-state output photo current density of \n\n  $21.50\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , which are close to the corresponding parameters obtained from the  $J{-}V$  curve. The small difference   $({\\approx}5\\%)$  in PCEs of the actual steady-state output and the  $J{-}V$  curve is  attributed to the difference between the two testing modes. In  contrast, an unstable steady-state output of the control device  was observed (Figure S12, Supporting Information). A comparison of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) with the  integrated current density plots for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2^{-}}}$   and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}R C Q s}.$  - based PSCs in Figure 4e shows that the EQE for the PSC with  RCQs is clearly enhanced over nearly the entire visible light  wavelength range, with an integrated  $J_{S C}$   of up to  $22.7\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,  which is in accordance with  $J_{\\mathrm{SC}}\\approx23.3~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   obtained from  the  $J{-}V$  curve.  \n\nThe effect of the novel ETL on the device stability was  investigated by determining the shelf-life stability of the present devices following the ISOS-D-1 (shelf lifetime) protocol  established by Krebs et al.:  in the dark at room temperature   $({\\approx}25\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C},$  ,   $40\\%$   humidity, in air). The normalized PCEs of both  devices without encapsulation are shown in Figure 4f as a function of the exposure time in a dark environment with   $40–60\\%$  relative humidity at  $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . Notably, the PCE of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO_{2}}{\\cdot}R C Q s}{\\cdot}$  based PSC only dropped slightly to   $96\\%$  , even after   $1000\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$  ,  whereas that of the control PSC reduced to   $80\\%$   for the same  exposure time, demonstrating that the novel   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -RCQs ETL  enhanced the stability of planar PSCs significantly in comparison to those based on a pristine   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL. The stability  of the devices was investigated under operational conditions at  the maximum power point under a continuous illumination of  1 sun   $(\\mathrm{AM}\\ 1.5\\ \\mathrm{G}$  ) in air. As shown in Figure S13 (Supporting  Information), it is clear that the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   PSCs can still  maintain more than  $87\\%$   of the initial PCE after   $100\\,\\mathrm{h}$  , whereas  only   $80\\%$   of the initial PCE was left in the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   devices after  only   $70\\textrm{h}$  . This result further indicates that the ion migration  can be reduced in perovskite films grown on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  - RCQs ETLs.  \n\nIn summary, carboxylic acid- and hydroxyl-rich-RCQs-doped   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   was fabricated into an effective composite ETL with an  electron mobility of   $1.73\\,\\times\\,10^{-2}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , which is one of  highest reported values for modified   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . This novel ETL  has been proved to promote the crystallization of perovskite,  resulting in enhanced crystalline phase purity with improved  uniformity and reduced traps/defects at the ETL/perovskite  interface. Based on this novel ETL, a champion PCE for   $\\mathrm{n{-}i{-}p}$    PSCs of up to   $22.77\\%$   has been achieved with significantly  improved device environmental stability, retaining over   $95\\%$    of the initial PCE at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   after   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$  , when exposed to less  than   $40–60\\%$   humidity. All these excellent achievements can  be solely attributed to the RCQs-doped   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL and demonstrate that inexpensive RCQs are simple but extremely effective  additives for efficient ETLs in stable high-performance PSCs,\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
