Although, deep-blue emission can be  achieved in perovskite materials by using  halides engineering as demonstrated in  perovskite nano crystal based devices,   however, the intrinsic natures of ion  migration and segregation lead to a spectrum redshift under external excitation.   Recently, quasi-2D perovskite materials  with reduced dimensional domain were  developed by introducing larger organic  ammonium (spacer) to separate a 3D  inorganic octahedron network. It provides  an opportunity to realize deep-blue emission, where the bandgaps of Br-based  low-dimensional domains with number of  inorganic layers   $(n)$   of 1, 2, and 3 are about   $3.1\\ \\mathrm{eV}$     $(400\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  ),   $2.9\\,\\mathrm{~eV~}$     $(427\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  , and   $2.7\\ \\mathrm{\\eV}$   $(460\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  , respectively.  Ideally  preformed blue perovskite LEDs have been  achieved by using such a strategy.  \n\nCompared to efficient green and near-infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs),  less progress has been made on deep-blue perovskite LEDs. They suffer  from inefficient domain [various number of   $\\mathsf{P b X}_{6}^{\\,-}$   layers ( n )] control,  resulting in a series of unfavorable issues such as unstable color, multipeak  profile, and poor fluorescence yield. Here, a strategy involving a delicate  spacer modulation for quasi-2D perovskite films via an introduction of  aromatic polyamine molecules into the perovskite precursor is reported.  With low-dimensional component engineering, the  $\\mathsf{n}_{1}$   domain, which shows  non radiative recombination and retarded exciton transfer, is significantly  suppressed. Also, the  $\\mathsf{n}_{3}$   domain, which represents the population of  emission species, is remarkably increased. The optimized quasi-2D  perovskite film presents blue emission from the  $\\mathsf{n}_{3}$   domain (peak at  $\\pmb{465\\,\\mathrm{nm}}]$  )  with a photo luminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as   $\\mathbf{77\\%}$  . It enables  the corresponding perovskite LEDs to deliver stable deep-blue emission (CIE  (0.145, 0.05)) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of   $\\mathbf{2.6\\%}$  . The findings  in this work provide further understanding on the structural and emission  properties of quasi-2D per ovsk ites, which pave a new route to design deepblue-emissive perovskite materials.  \n\nOwing  to  significant  spatial  and  dielectric confinements in low-dimensional domains, the  excited states were demonstrated in form of excitons with  unique transfer dynamics. A cascade energy transfer from  lown  domains (large bandgap) to high $\\cdot n$  domains (low  bandgap) dramatically boosts the radiative recombination rates  in the highest $\\cdot n$   domain.  Although, such an energy transfer  process successfully elevates the external quantum efficiency  (EQE) of green PeLEDs over   $15\\%$  ,  it simultaneously causes  a plight for deep-blue emission (i.e., any involvement of high $n$   domains   $(n\\ >\\ 3)$  ) will inevitably induces a red shifting).   Actually, the low-dimensional domains in quasi-2D perovskite films with typical spacers such as butylamine (BA) and  phenyl ethyl amine (PEA) are in homogeneous and unstable.   Thermal treatment or several hours of storage in ambient leads  to the appearance of high $\\cdot n$   domains in the deposited films  (Figure S2, Supporting Information). An introduction of more  spacer cation is beneficial for the formation of low-dimensional  domains. However, this approach also raises the concerns  of simultaneously sacrificing conductivity.  This makes it  complex for controlled modulation of domain distribution in  quasi-2D perovskite films. Furthermore, slow and incomplete  exciton transfer caused by undesirable domain distribution  potentially result in multipeak photo luminescence (PL), EL  and poor photo luminescence quantum yield (PLQY).  \n\nAccording to the standard of National Television System Committee (NTSC), stable, efficient and pure deep-blue electroluminescence (EL) is imperative for new generation of display  techniques.  However, this requirement has always been a  challenge for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), quantum  \n\nRationally, a stable and controllable domain formation in quasi2D perovskite films, irrespective of external excitation, is no  doubt an important requirement in deep-blue PeLEDs.  \n\nHerein, we reveal that weak interaction between spacer  (PEABr) and inorganic octahedron is responsible for poor stability in low-dimensional domains. Therefore, we develop a new  aromatic poly ammonium  bromide [1,4-Bis(amino methyl)benzene bromide   $(\\mathrm{P{\\cdot}P D A B r_{2}})$  ] with double functional amido terminals which provides a strong binding force with   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{6}^{-}$  leading  to stable low-dimensional domains. Furthermore, low-dimensional component engineering (LCE) was executed relying  on mixed spacer system to control la bly modulate the domain  distribution in quasi-2D perovskite film. Consequently,   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$    domain   $(n\\,=\\,1)$  ) with severe non radiative recombination and  retarded exciton transfer was significantly suppressed in perovskite film. Meanwhile, the population of   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain (emitting  species) was enhanced without by-products of higher  $n$   domain  (emission peak longer than   $470\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  ). Such an exceptional composition resulted in a fast and complete exciton transfer from   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   and  $\\mathrm{n}_{2}$   domains to  $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain. The optimized 2D perovskite  films delivered ideally independent emission from   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain  (peak at   $465\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  ) with a high photo luminescence quantum  yield (PLQY) of   $77\\%$  . The fabricated PeLEDs exhibited a deepblue emission with a Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage  (CIE) coordinate at (0.14, 0.05), which was well matched with  the crucial blue NTSC standard of (0.14, 0.08). The device  presents a peak EQE of   $2.6\\%$  , which is an in vigor at ive result for  deep-blue PeLED on basis of pure bromide perovskite.  \n\n$\\mathrm{P{\\mathrm{-}P D A B r}_{2}}$   molecule with symmetrical double side amido  terminals is expected to set up interesting structural features  in corresponding 2D perovskite film   $(n=1)$  ).
