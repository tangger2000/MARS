Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs)  \n\nMetal–organic frameworks as new class comprises porous crystalline materials have received extensive attention because of their  attractive chemical and physical properties.  Usually, the  MOF is hybrid organic–inorganic materials composed by metal  ions or cluster that are connected by organic linkers forming 1D,  2D, or 3D structures feature well-defined pore structures, large  surface areas, and structural transform ability.  So far, about  20 000 coordination network structures are classified as MOFs  compounds, whose special crystalline micro porous features make  them appropriate hosts for various applications. The pores can  entrap various guests, including metal ions, coordination polymers, metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, and dye molecules  in their network, they are also chemically and thermally robust  during the reversible adsorption/desorption of guest molecules  (often solvents). The most common types of   $\\mathrm{PQD@MOF}$   composites include within-the-pore structures, core–shell structures,  and sandwich structures, which can enhance the stability of  PQDs and modulate electron–hole recombination rates indicated  by a long lifetime.  For examples, the   $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{p}\\mathrm{I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}@\\mathrm{HKUST-1}$  thin film obtained compact and homogeneous surface and most  of   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   QDs have diameters of   $1.5{-}2.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   matching well  with the pore size of HKUST-1 (  $\\mathrm{{1.66~nm}})$  ). The lifetimes   $(\\bar{\\tau})$   of  MAPbI X  $@$  HKUST-1   $(\\mathsf{X}\\,=\\,\\mathsf{C l})$  , Br, and I) thin films are 1.992,  2 2.175, and  $2.100\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$  , which are longer than those of powder samples (1.872, 1.949, and   $2.03\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{s},$  ), respectively, indicating the strong  inhibition of the nonradioactive process. It is worth mentioned  that   $\\mathrm{PQCDs}@\\mathrm{HKUST}{\\!\\!:\\!1}$   thin film is insensitive to air and moisture, indicative of a good stability.  \n\n# 5. Applications of Encapsulated PQDs  \n\nWith the improved stability of PQDs by encapsulation, a large  number of applications can be updated with enhanced device  performance. The metal halide perovskite quantum dots have  rapidly emerged as a unique class of op to electronic materials  owing to their excellent properties as the high PLQYs and/ or tunable light emission. The encapsulated PQDs show an  improved the stability and enhanced process ability, which are  fitted well for op to electronics and photonics areas ranging from  LEDs, lasers, and biological applications.  \n\n# 5.1. Phosphors for Converted White LED and Displays  \n\nEncapsulated PQDs with high PLQYs, spectral tunability,  narrow emission bands, tunable spectral properties and wide  color selectivity, are ideally suited for color conversion in white  light diodes, particularly important for display backlights.   The anion-exchange reactions were not observed between  different encapsulated PQDs, which are beneficial to fabricating white LED devices. Also, most encapsulation matrix  solve the incompatibility between LED packaging glues  (silicone polymerization) and hydrophobic organic ligands of  bare PQDs, the encapsulated PQDs are more easily processed  into film or powder compatible with mature packaging techniques in commercial applications.   Table    1  summarizes the important photoelectric parameters for white LEDs  constructed by PQDs. Currently, the main way to realize white  light emission is combination of PQDs with either QDs or  other types of luminescent materials such as traditional inorganic rare-earth-doped phosphors.  \n\nUsually, synthesis LEDs based on PQDs showed good  performances at low power devices. For examples, a simple  white LEDs pattern can be synthesized by mixing multiply  single emission of   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{PS}$   with single blue, green, red, and  intermediate emitting, which can avoid ion exchange efficiently  and give a broad PL emission range from the entire visible spectral   $(410{-}770~\\mathrm{nm})$  ), matching well with the background air mass  1.5 solar spectrum as shown in  Figure    10 a. Figure  10a also  shows the spectra of white LEDs with two mixture of   $\\operatorname{PODs}(\\emptyset)$  MS powders (green and red) on blue chips, showing three  discrete emission peaks located at 450, 519, and   $625\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  .
