Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

The metal ions may nucleate at a sub-nanometer size on the surface or inside the parent perovskite, and  then migrate to the surface. The exsolution of SFMC is reversible, therefore, we focus on in situ observation of the re-oxidation process, which has seldom been reported in the literatures.  FigureÂ  2c shows direct insights into the re-oxidation process.  The CoFe alloy nanoparticles are oxidized fleetly to flaky particles that are attached onto the perovskite surface at  $600~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , and  the flat particles with irregular shape do not restore back to the  parent perovskite until the temperature ascends to   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . An  obvious morphology change occurs during the inter-diffusion  between the   $\\mathrm{CoFeO}_{x}$  and the perovskite, and the   $\\mathrm{CoFeO}_{x}$  are  dissolved into the bulk of layered perovskite with structure  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/5ad9d962ee688ee328a41f8c236b05a1a4bb51152ded6429e8cb3df971f366de-1727127603.jpg)  \nScheme 1. â a) Schematic representation of the exsolution and dissolution process. b) Schematic illustration of the model used for the calculations of  the segregation energy and the comparison of the segregation energy.   $(\\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{O}}$   and  $\\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{C}\\mathsf{o}}$   mean oxygen and cobalt vacancies.

In combination with the XRD, SEM, and HRTEM results (FigureÂ  1f,g;  Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information), we show a direct  insight that the CoFe alloy nanoparticles re incorporate into the  parent perovskite via a   $\\mathrm{CoFeO}_{x}$  (probably   $\\mathrm{CoFe_{2}O_{4}})$   pathway,  and the oxidation of CoFe alloy nanoparticles is facile whereas  the dissolution of the oxide back into the perovskite with a significant restructuring is energy-intensive.  \n\nFigure Â   3 a,d and Figure S4, Supporting Information, show  the micro structures of the as-prepared SFMC and SFMC 1, 2,  and   $^{\\mathrm{~4~h~}}$  , respectively. SFMC powder shows a smooth surface  (FigureÂ  3a), while CoFe alloy nanoparticles are exsolved and  anchored on the SFMC surface uniformly after reduction in   $5\\%\\;\\mathrm{H}_{2}/\\mathrm{Ar}$  . The size of CoFe alloy nanoparticles increases significantly with prolonging the reduction time. STEM images  reveal that SFMC substrate is adhered with some nanoparticles after reduction (FigureÂ  3e,f). HRTEM images of two  typical nanoparticles are shown in FigureÂ   $_{3\\mathrm{g}}$   and Figure S5,  Supporting Information. The inter planar spacing of the substrate is   $0.284\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , corresponding to the (105) plane of the layered perovskite, while the lattice space of the nano particle is   $0.203\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , which is quite close to that of (110) plane of CoFe  alloy phase. Meanwhile, the profile view of the interface reveals  that part of the oblate spheroids are submerged into the substrate, indicative of a strong interaction between the perovskite  substrate and the anchored nanoparticles.  This  anchoring effect is expected to provide enhanced thermal stability through preventing the severe agglomeration during  long-term operation.  Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy  elemental maps confirm the presence of Sr, Fe, Mo, and Co  in SFMC 2h. It can be observed in FigureÂ 3h and Figure S6,  Supporting Information, that Co and Fe elements are distributed uniformly in the exsolved nanoparticles, demonstrates the  formation of CoFe alloy nanoparticles, indicating that only Co  and Fe can be exsolved from the SFMC substrate under the  reducing atmosphere. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results  further confirm the exsolution of CoFe alloy and improved  oxygen vacancies after reduction (Figure S7, Supporting Information).   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   temperature-programmed desorption profiles  demonstrate the enhanced chemical adsorption of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   after  reduction (Figure S8, Supporting Information).  \n\nThe electrochemical performance of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis was  evaluated using single cell with SFMC-GDC   $(\\mathrm{{Gd_{0.2}C e_{0.8}O_{1.9}}})$  cathode.

The SOECs possess identical components except  for the cathodes (Figure S9, Supporting Information).

A maximum current density of   $1.2\\,\\textrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at   $800\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  and   $1.6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   is obtained over SFMC-GDC 2h cell, which shows  a respectable increment of   $50\\%$   compared to that of SFMCGDC cell. The enhanced current density can be ascribed to  the synergistic effect of the exsolved CoFe alloy nanoparticles  and increased oxygen vacancies of SFMC. Polarization resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{p}})$   from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  is crucial to the electrode performance. As expected,   $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$   values  are significantly reduced by the in situ exsolution operation  (Figure S10b, Supporting Information). For example,   $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$   is  reduced by   $57.9\\%$  , from   $0.280~\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   of the SFMC-GDC cell  to   $0.118\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   of the SFMC-GDC 2h cell (FigureÂ  4b).
