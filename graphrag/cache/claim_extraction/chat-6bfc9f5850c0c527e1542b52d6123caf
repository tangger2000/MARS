Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Ionic Liquids  \n\nIonic liquid is defined as salt in liquid state without any decomposition or vaporization. In contrast to ordinary solvents like  water, ionic liquid consists of ions and short-lived ion pairs  instead of neutrally charged molecules. It has been considered  the solvent of the future.  Walden reported the first roomtemperature ionic liquid in 1914;  since then there has been  ongoing interest in ionic liquid research and diverse potential applications have been described, including cellulose processing,  nuclear fuel processing,  solar thermal energy  systems,  and batteries.  \n\nIonic liquidâ€“based complex film, a mixture of transition metal  compounds and ionic liquid, has received considerable attention  as a promising candidate for energy-saving smart windows due  to its ability to modulate solar radiation by absorption. Current  research in this field is mainly focused on thermo chromic ionic  liquids, whose property is based on an octahedralâ€“tetrahedral  configuration change of transition metal complexes assisted  by interaction with donor solvent molecules. More specifically,  octahedral complexes are formed at low temperatures, while the  complexes become tetrahedral at high temperatures, leading to  the light transmittance variation ( Figure   4 a).  The chromic  variation is caused by a change in energy difference between  $\\mathrm{t}_{2\\mathrm{g}}$  and   $\\mathrm{e_{g}}$   orbitals through the configuration transformation:  in  the tetrahedral configuration, the energy gap between  $\\mathrm{t}_{2\\mathrm{g}}$   and  $\\mathrm{e_{g}}$  orbitals is much smaller than that in the octahedral complexes;  \n\nhence, resulting in a strong absorption at higher temperature  and a favorable thermo chromic response.  \n\nIonic liquidâ€“based complex materials display high sensitivity  and efficiency to temperature change. For example, Wei etÂ al.  reported a thermo chromic system of dissolved   $\\mathrm{[bmin]}_{2}\\mathrm{NCI}_{4}$   in   $\\mathrm{C}_{n}\\mathrm{OH}_{\\mathrm{min}}{}^{+}$  -based ionic liquids.  In this nickel(II)-based ionic  liquid system, the enthalpy and entropy changes during the  octahedralâ€“tetrahedral configuration transformation were just   $30{-}40\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}}$   and   $140{-}160\\ \\mathrm{J\\mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$  , respectively, leading  to a promising low energy requirement that was fully achievable by exposure to sunlight. However, the solar modulation  ability of pure ionic liquidâ€“based composite systems has been  insufficient for use in energy-efficient smart window applications due to the narrow modulation spectrum range. To address  this issue, both inorganic and organic approaches have been  developed.  \n\nThe inorganic approach hybridizes an ionic liquidâ€“based  complex system with  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   nanoparticles. For example, Zhu etÂ al.  reported a composite film made up of   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   nanoparticles and  ILâ€“Niâ€“Cl complexes.  The pure ILâ€“Niâ€“Cl displayed a signifi- cant transmittance contrast mainly in the   $500{-}800\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   spectral  range, resulting in limited modulation ability in the context of  the full solar energy spectral range of   $250{-}2500\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 4b).  However, the composite of ILâ€“Niâ€“Cl and   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   significantly  broadened the modulation range and thereby promoted solar  energy regulation, which was attributed to the combination of  ILâ€“Niâ€“Cl visible light modulation   $(500{-}800\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) as well as   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/814014c4838494d44efa717b7d88521ac7e3ae5caae051d512300c300a4737db-1727078161.jpg)  \nFigure 4. â€‚ a) Schematic illustration of octahedralâ€“tetrahedral configuration change of ionic liquidâ€“based complex system.
