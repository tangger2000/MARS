The optimized device  shows a clearly slower photo voltage decay   $(293.29\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$   compared  with the control device   $(105.87~\\ensuremath{\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}})$  , confirming substantially  slowed charge recombination in the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film,  which is consistent with the conclusions derived from the PL  decay measurement.  \n\nThe surface morph o logie s of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite films  are observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and  atomic force microscopy (AFM). As given in   Figure    2 a,b, for  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, a porous surface on a dense layer can be  observed, which possesses a large surface area and high surface  energy, and favors the photo current and stability of the CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs.  Figures S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information present SEM and AFM images of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  films with  different amounts of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additives (  $.0\\%$  ,   $0.25\\%$  ,   $0.5\\%$  ,   $0.75\\%$  ,  and   $1\\%~\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{M}$  ). For the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, the gullies in  the porous surface have become shallow and the ridges have  widened, which is probably due to the increased crystal lin it y  of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with the addition of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  . The cross-sectional SEM images demonstrate that the control and optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films are compact (Figure 2c,d). AFM images indicate  that the surficial root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the optimized film   $(8.2\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   is significantly lower than that of the control film   $(14.6\\;\\mathrm{nm})$  )\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
