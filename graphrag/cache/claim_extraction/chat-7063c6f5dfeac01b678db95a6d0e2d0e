For   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$  , the exciton  binding energy evaluated was  ${\\approx}490\\ \\mathrm{meV},$  , which is much larger  than that   $(\\approx\\!18\\,\\mathrm{\\meV})$   of the 3D perovskite material.  Such a  high exciton binding energy is considered to originate from the  0D nature of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}.$  , as discussed earlier. The exciton lifetime  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   was   ${\\approx}464$   ns from the PL decay curve in Figure 3b.  This lifetime is as long as that of the 0D organic tin halides, in which the excited-state structural reorganization was considered to explain the PL mechanism. In general, the self-trapped  exciton luminescence is accompanied by another emission peak  attributed to direct transition.  However, only one emission  peak was observed for   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   (see Figure  S7, Supporting  Information). Furthermore, the PL lifetime determined from  the self-trapped exciton model is much shorter (  $\\left(\\approx\\right.$  several ten  nanoseconds) than that   $(\\approx\\!464~\\mathrm{ns})$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$  .  It is, thus,  plausible that the excited-state structural reorganization dominates the PL mechanism of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$  . The excited-state structural reorganization is explained by Jahn–Teller distortion.   Typically,   $\\mathrm{{Cu}(I)}$   halide with the  $\\mathsf{d}^{10}$   closed-shell favors a tetrahedral geometry.  In the photo excited state,   $\\mathrm{{Cu}(I)}$   with tetrahedral geometries forms a Jahn–Teller distorted   $\\mathrm{{Cu(II)-d^{9}}}$   center,  as shown in Figure  S8 (Supporting Information). Therefore,  the excitation and recombination processes for   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   are  schematically shown in Figure 3c. When the bandgap photon  energy is absorbed, the electronic configuration of   $\\mathrm{{Cu}(I)\\ 3d^{10}}$    changes to   $\\mathrm{Cu}(\\mathrm{II})3\\mathrm{d}^{9}$  , inducing Jahn–Teller distortion and subsequent reorganization of the excited-state structure. According  to this mechanism, the Stokes shift is determined primarily by  the energy difference between   $\\mathrm{{Cu}}(\\mathrm{{I}})3\\mathrm{{d}}^{10}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cu}(\\mathrm{II})3\\mathrm{d}^{9}$  . Therefore, the positions of the first excitation peak and the luminescence peak are rather different. Broad emission with a long  lifetime is a characteristic of   $\\mathrm{Cu(I)}$  -complexed phosphorescent  emissions involving Jahn–Teller distortion.  \n\nThe high PLQY of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   is significant for a variety of applications. First, we employed   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   in a white luminescent  application by utilizing two materials features: high conversion  efficiency and no self-absorption are expected from its high  PLQY and large Stokes shift. To fabricate a white luminescent  film, we mixed   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   powder with a yellow phosphor.

It was confirmed that CIE coordinates can  be linearly tuned from (0.15.0.09) to (0.44.0.48) by varying the  mixing ratio, as seen in Figure 4b. The broad white spectrum in  Figure 4c substantiates two components of   ${\\approx}445$   and   ${\\approx}580\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  for  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   and yellow phosphor, respectively.  \n\nNext, we fabricated a blue LED with the structure of ITO/  $\\mathrm{ZSO/Cs_{3}C u_{2}I_{5}/N P D/M o O_{x}/A g}.$  .  The   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   thin film  was spin-coated onto the indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc silicate  (ZSO).  Figure 4d shows a photograph of the fabricated blue  LED of size   $1~\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   and its current-density–luminance–voltage   $(J{-}L{-}V)$   characteristics. The peak wavelength of electro lu minescence (EL) is   ${\\approx}440\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , as seen in Figure S9 (Supporting Information), which is almost the same as that of PL.

The maximum  luminance was   ${\\approx}10$   cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  . This low performance may be  attributed to the unfavorable energy level alignment.
