Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The cross-sectional morphology of PeLEDs  was characterized by SEM (Zeiss Supra 55). The crystalline structure  of perovskite films was characterized by an X-ray diffract o meter (D8  DISCOVER, Brucker) with   $\\mathsf{C u}^{\\mathrm{~\\tiny~\\mathsf{~K}}\\alpha}$   radiation. The contact angles of  perovskite films were monitored with a contact-angle tester (Data Physics  instruments GmbH). Absorption spectra were characterized by a UV–vis– near-IR spectrometer with an integrating-sphere accessory (Perkin Elmer  Lambda 950). Steady-state photo luminescence (PL) spectra and timeresolved PL (TRPL) decays of the perovskite films were characterized  by a Quantaurus-Tau fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (C11367-32,  Hamamatsu Photonics) with a pulsed laser of   $373\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$  . The absolute  photo luminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of perovskite films were  measured under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature through  a C9920-02G type fluorescence spectrophotometer (HAMAMASTU,  Japan) with an integrating sphere excited at   $365\\ \\mathrm{\\textmu m}$  . The Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement was conducted by  using absorption infrared spectrometer (VERTX 70). UV photo emission  spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were  performed with an ultrahigh vacuum photo emission spectroscopy  system (Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD). XPS profiles were measured using a  monochromatic Al K α  source (1486.6 eV) with a total instrument energy  resolution of 500  meV. UPS was measured using an unfiltered He I  radiation line   $(21.22\\,\\mathsf{e V})$   from a discharge lamp for excitation and a total  energy resolution of 100  meV. The current density-voltage-luminance   $(J{-}V{-}L)$   characteristics and electroluminescence (EL) spectra of PeLEDs  were measured simultaneously with an integrating sphere (Hamamatsu  Photonics K.K. C9920-12) in air ambience at room temperature, which  were further verified by using a computer-controlled programmable  power source (Keithley model 2400) and a luminance meter/ spectrometer (Photo Research PR670). The transient EL decay curves  of PeLEDs were measured under an electrical excitation with the pulse  (duty cycle of   $20\\%$  ) generated by a pulse generator (keysight 81150A).  The impedance spectra were measured under a small AC signal with an  amplitude of   $10\\;\\mathsf{m V}$   at a DC voltage of   $3.6\\;\\lor$   (Agilent 4294A).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nW.Z. and Y.S. contributed equally to this work.
