However, planar devices  are still less efficient than mesoporous devices.  \n\nHere, we introduce a simple low-temperature solutionprocessed   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   bilayer ETL for efficient planar PSCs.  We demonstrate that uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films  can be obtained by the introduction of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  . The band energy  alignment can be also tailored with increased built-in potential,  resulting in an enhanced electric field for the separation of carriers and enhanced charge transfer, as well as reduced carrier  recombination. The planar PSC utilizing  $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ETL demonstrated a higher efficiency of   $23.24\\%$   with negligible hysteresis and   $22.74\\%$   stable power output compared with a   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}.$  - based device that has an efficiency of   $21.42\\%$  . In addition, the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -based PSC maintains   $97.5\\%$   of its initial PCE after  being stored under   $\\Nu_{2}$   for 80 days without encapsulation and  retain   $91\\%$  of their initial PCE after   $180\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$  under 1 sun continuous illumination.  \n\nFigure    $^{1\\mathrm{a-d}}$   shows the surface morph o logie s of ITO,   $\\mathrm{ITO}/$   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{ITO/S n O}_{2}$  , and   $\\mathrm{ITO}/\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  , respectively. Compared with bare ITO, the surface of   $\\mathrm{ITO/In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   is evidently  much smoother. Moreover,   $\\mathrm{ITO}/\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   has an improved  roughness and much better homogeneity than that of   $\\mathrm{ITO}/$   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . Atom force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to further investigate the roughness of the samples. As shown in  Figure S1 (Supporting Information), the root mean square \n\n (RMS) roughness of these four samples was reduced from \n\n  $5.5\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   for ITO only to   $2.2\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   after spin-coating   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  . The  roughness of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   spin-coated on bare ITO decreased from 2.2  to   $1.4~\\mathrm{nm}$   when   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   was introduced. X-ray diffraction (XRD)  and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) verified the existence  of the thin   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   layer. As shown in Figure S2 (Supporting  Information), there are distinct diffraction peaks at   $30.6^{\\circ}$  ,   $35.5^{\\circ}$  ,  and   $51.0^{\\circ}$  , indicating the formation of pure   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   crystals. The  cross-sectional SEM image of the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   film further confirmed  its thickness of   ${\\approx}10\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure S3, Supporting Information).   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nanoparticles do not easily form dense films on rough  ITO, but sol–gel-processed   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   may enhance the physical  contact with ITO, improving the electrical performance of  resulting devices.  \n\nTo further demonstrate the influence of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}.$  , top-view  SEM images of the perovskite films were examined. As shown  in Figure 1e,f, uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films with  larger grain sizes can be obtained when deposited on the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ETL substrate than on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL. The grain size  of perovskite films is increased by an average of around   $200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  (Figure S4, Supporting Information) with the incorporation  of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  . Pinholes on the surface of the films will reduce the  shunt resistance and lead to recombination,  which are detrimental to the performance of devices. Moreover, the RMS  roughness of corresponding films was significantly reduced  from 44 to   $33~\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure S5, Supporting Information), which  can be attributed to the smoother surface of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   when   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  was introduced to the devices.  \n\nIn order to evaluate the influence of the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   underlayer on  light utilization, we measured the optical transmission of the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   film on ITO, as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). Unexpectedly, the lowest transmittance is recorded  by bare ITO. After depositing   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , and   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ,  the transmittance successively increases, which is due to the  decrease of reflected light.  \n\nUniform and compact perovskite films lay the foundation for  efficient PSCs. To better understand the variations in properties of the deposited perovskite films after introducing of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  ,  XRD was performed.  Figure   2 a shows the XRD patterns of the  films based on different ETLs. The strong intensity of the XRD  peaks is related to better crystallization. So a better crystal film  was obtained which is consistent with SEM results. The optical  absorption spectra of these two films were measured by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy. Figure 2b shows that the  presence of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   does not affect the absorption edge of perovskite films while slightly increasing the absorption intensity.  The bandgap of both films extracted from Tauc plots shows an  identical value of   $1.53~\\mathrm{eV}$   (Figure S7, Supporting Information).  \n\nIn order to determine the dynamics of charge transfer and  the extraction characteristics of different ETLs, steady-state  photo luminescence (PL) and time-resolved photo luminescence \n\n (TRPL) spectroscopy were performed. As shown in Figure 2c, \n\n  $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   does not alter the peak luminescence position. The films  based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ETL exhibited an emission at  800 and   $799\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , respectively. Compared with a glass substrate,  both films show a strong quenching effect. The PL spectrum  of perovskite film on   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   exhibits decreased intensity  compared to the film on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL, which means faster extraction of charges.  \n\nThe radiative recombination rate from photoinduced carriers competing with non radiative loss  plays a key role in the  recombination process.   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   contributes to efficient PSCs by  mitigating non radiative losses. Similar results were confirmed  by TRPL. Figure 2d indicates that the PL decay of film based  on  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL delivered a longer lifetime than that of film based  on   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  . The lifetimes of perovskite film based on  glass,   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , and   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ETL are 1794, 528, and 340  ns\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
