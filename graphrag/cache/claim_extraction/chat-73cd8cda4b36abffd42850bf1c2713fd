Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As a result, the  cost and consumption of raw material   $\\left({\\mathrm{Li}}_{2}{\\mathrm{CO}}_{3}\\right)$   for LIBs were drastically  increased during the last ten years.   Own to its low price and element abundance, sodium gradually attracts the  academic attention and becomes a  promising substitute of lithium for nextgeneration commercial rechargeable batteries.  However, due to the large ionic  radius of   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   (1.02 Å) compared to   $\\mathrm{Li^{+}}$    (0.76 Å), fabricating a more beneficial  anode material aims to better   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   inser- tion and extraction is a pivotal object for  sodium-ion batteries (SIBs or NIBs).   Very recently, alloying and conversionbased anode materials (e.g., Sb, P,   $\\mathrm{SnS}_{2}$  ,  and   ${\\mathrm{FeS}}_{2}.$  ) have been regularly investi  \n\nTransition-metal disulfide with its layered structure is regarded as a kind of  promi­ sing host material for sodium insertion, and intensely investigated for  sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a simple sol vo thermal method to synthesize a series of  $\\mathsf{M o S}_{2}$   nanosheets  $@$  nitrogen-doped graphene composites is  developed. This newly designed recipe of raw materials and solvents leads the  success of tuning size, number of layers, and inter planar spacing of the asprepared  $\\mathsf{M o S}_{2}$   nanosheets. Under cut-off voltage and based on an inter cal ation  mechanism, the ultrasmall  $\\mathsf{M o S}_{2}$   nanosheets  $@$  nitrogen-doped graphene composite exhibits more preferable cycling and rate performance compared to few-/ dozens-layered  $\\mathsf{M o S}_{2}$   nanosheets  $@$  nitrogen-doped graphene, as well as many  other reported insertion-type anode materials. Last, detailed kinetics analysis  and density functional theory calculation are also employed to explain the  ${\\sf N a}^{+}$  -  storage behavior, thus proving the significance in surface-controlled pseudocapacitance contribution at the high rate. Furthermore, this work offers some  meaningful preparation and investigation experiences for designing electrode  materials for commercial sodium-ion batteries with favorable performance.  \n\nDr. X.

Unfortunately,  the large volume variations and serious agglomeration of  the negative electrodes during the sodiation/des odi ation  processes give rise to a fast capacity decay. Although preparing nano-sized active components together with the  carbon assistant can relieve the above-mentioned defects  to some extent, the reported results are hard to fulfill the  commercial applications yet. On the other hand, a series of   $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$   and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   nano structures with inter cal ation mechanism also have been fabricated and employed for long-cyclelife sodium storage, but the limited specific capacities are  still unsatisfactory.  Thus, developing a novel strategy or  searching for a new kind of electrode material for NIBs is  still desirable.  \n\nMolybdenum disulfide   $(\\mathrm{MoS}_{2})$  , a typical 2D transition-metal  disulfide with large distance between stacked layers, was frequently investigated in both the LIBs and NIBs fields.   When an   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  -based anode is evaluated in  $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   half-cells, intercalation and conversion reactions take place in order under a  discharge process. As demonstrated in Equations (1) and (2),  Na ions first insert into the   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   inter layers with the discharge  voltage varying from 3 to   $0.4~\\mathrm{V},$   and then   $\\mathrm{Na}_{x}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   fully transforms to metallic Mo and   $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{S}$   when the potential is below   $0.4\\;\\mathrm{V}.^{[20-22]}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/bf6ea085efa75830b12610bf6b75bd21c49d9faff4bc1c45c16f8d38befd447a-1727117732.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Schematic illustration of the synthesis procedures and morph o logie s of the DL  $\\cdot{\\mathsf{M o S}}_{2}@{\\mathsf{N G}}$  , FL $\\cdot{\\mathsf{M o S}}_{2}@{\\mathsf{N G}}$  , and U  $\\mathsf{I S.M o S_{2}@N G}$   (Scale bars,   $100\\;\\mathsf{n m}$  ).  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}+x\\mathrm{Na}=\\mathrm{Na}_{x}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}\\quad\\ \\left(\\mathrm{above}\\,0.4\\,\\mathrm{V},x<2\\right)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Na}_{x}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}+(4-x)\\mathrm{Na}=\\mathrm{Mo}+2\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{S}\\ (\\mathrm{bellow}\\ 0.4\\ \\mathrm{V})\n$$  \n\nSeveral former works report that controlling charge/discharge voltage through a cut-off method to ensure an intercalation process is able to significantly improve the cycling  stability.  However, abandon of the conversion reaction  means a sacrifice of theoretical capacity as well as increasing  the operation voltage. Therefore, the promotion of the specific  capacity of insertion-type  $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   electrode becomes more urgent.  \n\nIt is generally accepted that during the discharge step,  solvated ions   $\\mathrm{(Li^{+}}$   or  $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  ) can be stored by most of anode materials via not only a diffusion-controlled process but also a Faradaic charge transfer existing at or near the surface/subsurface  of electrode material, that is, the so-called surface-controlled  process, meanwhile leading to an extra pseudo capacitance. Very recently, some groups demonstrated that decreasing the  size of nano-scale metal disulfides and expanding the distance  of interlayer are able to generate a considerable capacitive contribution, thus, resulting in an apparent improvement of specific capacities and rate performance.  On the other hand,  the electrochemical properties of pure   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  -based materials  are often critically impeded by their poor electric conductivity.  To solve this problem, assembling   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nano structures with  carbon nanotubes or graphene is proved to be an effective  approach.  For example, Yu et al. fabricated ultrathin   ${\\mathrm{MoS}}_{2}$  nanowall arrays anchored on carbon layer hybrids through an  in situ hybridization method and then tested them under a cutoff voltage   $(0.4{-}3.0\\ \\mathrm{V})$  ), which displayed an excellent reversible  capacity of   $120\\;\\mathrm{mArh\\;g^{-1}}$   at a high rate of   $10\\;\\mathrm{\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
