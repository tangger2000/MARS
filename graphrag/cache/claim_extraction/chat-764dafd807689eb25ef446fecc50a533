Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

As shown  in Figure S9 of the Supporting Information, the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@$  NG composite can still retain its hierarchical morphology after  cycling performance, thus proving the favorable structural  stability during the electrochemical reactions. As a contrast,  the cycling stability of the   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NC}$   and   $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{OL-MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$  is more inferior. In addition, the discharge capacities of the  NG are around   $20\\ \\mathrm{mArh\\g^{-1}}$   at the same current density, suggesting that the main capacities of the   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$   composites are contributed by the extrinsic   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   shell. The different   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$   anodes are also tested at relatively low current  densities   $(200\\mathrm{\\mA\\g^{-1}})$  , with final discharge capacities of 238,  213, and   $174\\;\\mathrm{mAr\\;g^{-1}}$   after 400 cycles, respectively (Figure S10,  Supporting Information). In addition, all of the   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$  samples are investigated by Nyquist plots, the U  $\\operatorname{J}S\\mathbf{-}\\mathbf{M o}S_{2}@$  NG exhibits the smallest semicircle diameter among the  three kinds of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$   composites, apparently indicating  the lowest resistance (Figure S11, Supporting Information).

As shown in Figure  S12 in the Supporting Information, all of the related elements  except for the Cu can be discovered clearly, thus confirming that  the main capacities are contributed by  $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$   composites.  When a Ti foil is used as a current collector, the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$  can still maintain its stable cycling performance (Figure S13,  Supporting Information).  \n\nTo further investigate the relationship between the pseudo capacitance-like contribution and rate performance of the  as-prepared   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$   samples, we employ the kinetics and  quantitative analysis by a series of CV measurements immediately.  Figure   4 a shows the stepwise CV curves of   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$  electrode under the scan rates ranging from 0.4 to   $1\\;\\mathrm{mV}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . As  can be seen, all of the CV curves display analogous shapes with  four redox peaks distributed in the reduction and oxidation  processes, indicating an obvious pseudo capacitive behavior.  Moreover, when the scan rates increased to   $2{-}10\\ \\mathrm{mV}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , the  redox peaks can still retain (Figure S6d, Supporting Information). It is well known that the current   $(i)$   and scan rate ( v ) of a  CV curve are dominated by the equation:   $I=\\!a\\nu^{b}$  , and the value  of   $b$   relies on the solvated ions storage mechanism   $(b=0.5$  ,  extreme diffusion-controlled process;  $b=1$  , extreme pseudocapacitive-controlled process).  In Figure 4b, the logarithm  peak currents against logarithm scan rates with linear relation  are drawn for next calculations, thus the   $b$   values of the four  redox peaks can be acquired as 1.02, 0.83, 0.93, and 0.88, respectively. This fact suggests that a mixed process existed in the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Mo}\\mathrm{S}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   anode, but the surface-controlled capacitive   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  storage mechanism should be more dominant (compared to  the  $b$   values of   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NC}$   and D  $\\bullet\\mathrm{L}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}\\mathrm{@N G}$  ; Figure S14b  and S15b, Supporting Information). To be more accurate, the  quantitative capacitive contribution under the given scan rate  can be obtained from another equation:   $i=k_{1}\\nu+k_{2}\\nu^{1/2}$  , where   $k_{1}$  and   $k_{2}$   represent the surface pseudo capacitive-controlled and  diffusion-controlled processes, respectively. For example,  Figure 4c illustrates a separation of pseudo capacitive-controlled  current from the entire CV curve at   $1\\ \\mathrm{mV}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . The capacitive  contribution of   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   is around   $80\\%$   and higher than  that of   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NC}$     $({\\approx}73\\%$  ; Figure S14c, Supporting Information) and   $\\mathrm{DL}\\mathrm{Mod}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$     $({\\approx}66\\%$  ; Figure S15c, Supporting  Information), which determines a more favorable sodiumstorage behavior under high current densities. Figure 4d shows  that the pseudo capacitive contribution percentages are raised in  order with the increasing of the scan rates.  \n\nThe above results show that the surface-controlled capacitive contribution is more meaningful than that of diffusioncontrolled process at high rate, which can also be further  explained by the energy barriers of   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   storage through these  two approaches. Based on first principle, the diffusion of   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  is simulated by density functional theory (DFT) methods.  Figure   5 a demonstrates the top-view structure of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  layer.  In order to simplify the calculation, we considered two models  of single and double   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   layer(s) (Figure 5b,c). After lattice  relaxation, the lattice para­ meters for the two models are   $a=b$   $=8.451$   Å and   $a=b={\\overset{-}{8}}.457{\\mathrm{~\\AA~}}$  , respectively. As for the former  model, Na ions diffuse on the surface of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   layer. For the  latter one, Na ions diffuse in the interspace between two   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  layers, and the diffusion path is from the site on the top of Mo  to S.
