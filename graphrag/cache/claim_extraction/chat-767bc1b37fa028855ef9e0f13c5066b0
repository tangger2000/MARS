Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Improving the Performance of Tandems Using Efficient  Low-bandgap Solar Cells  \n\nThe lack of high-quality low-bandgap per ovsk ites severely  hampers the development of efficient and stable all-perovskite  tandem solar cells in the beginning years.  Yan etÂ al. reported  bulk pass iv ation via the use of chlorine to enlarge the grains  and to reduce the electronic disorder in mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide  low-bandgap   $(\\approx\\!1.25\\mathrm{\\Large~\\:eV})$   perovskite films.

Vacuum-processed multiple stacks of Ag (1Â nm), \n\n  $\\mathrm{MoO_{x}}$   (  $3\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ), and ITO   $(\\approx\\!120\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   were used as the recombination layer to fabricate all-perovskite tandem solar cells. The   $J{\\cdot}V$   curve (FigureÂ 9e) exhibited a reverse-scanned PCE of   $21\\%$  and a steady-state efficiency of   $20.7\\%$  .

By introducing   $7\\%$   GuaSCN into the perovskite  precursor solution, Yan and Zhu etÂ  al. reported single-junction low-bandgap PSCs with PCEs over   $20\\%$  .  The matched  current density of tandem solar cells was correspondingly  improved to   $15\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , leading to a high PCE of   $23.1\\%$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.915\\mathrm{~V},$  , and an FF of   $79.8\\%$   in monolithic all-perovskite  tandem solar cells.  \n\nVery recently, we improved the charge carrier diffusion length  in mixed   $\\mathrm{PbâSn}$   per ovsk ites to   $3~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   via a com proportion ation  reaction strategy.  The high   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   values achieved here provided  the chances to further increase the matched current density in  tandem solar cells. An ALD $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2,}$  /ultrathin Au recombination  layer structure was developed to avoid the sputtered ITO layer  (FigureÂ   $\\mathrm{9g)}$  ). As a result, the champion tandem device exhibited an  impressively high PCE of   $24.8\\%$  , with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.965\\mathrm{~V},$   a high  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  of   $15.6\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and an FF of   $81.0\\%$   (FigureÂ 9h). The EQE curves  showed that the two subcells were well-matched (FigureÂ 9i).  \n\n# 5. Conclusions  \n\nWe have summarized the recent progress in the development  of tin halide and mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide PSCs. Methods that have  been utilized to improve performance and to enhance stability  are discussed. Two intertwined major challenges need to be  addressed for the development of tin halide PSCs. To overcome the over-quick crystallization of tin halide per ovsk ites,  the cation exchange method has been developed except for the  thermal evaporation and vapor-assisted methods. By incorporating large organic cations, the performance and stability of  tin halide devices can be enhanced under ambient conditions.  To mitigate the ox i diz ation of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{SnX}_{2}$     $(\\mathrm{X}\\,=\\,\\mathrm{F}$  , Cl) serving  as   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$   com pens at or and other reducing additives have been  introduced. With reducing additives and post treatment passivation,   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   PSCs exhibit improved performance and stability.  \n\nThe mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide per ovsk ites have demonstrated  great potentials to address the three main challenges,  including morphology, performance, and stability, leading to  high-performance devices. The low-bandgap mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$    halide per ovsk ites are promising candidates for fabricating  highly efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells. The monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells have achieved an impressive PCE of   $24.8\\%$  , which is comparable with those of silicon  solar cells. It is expected that the nontoxic (or less-toxic) Sn-contained per ovsk ites will have up-and-coming prospects for both  single-junction and tandem solar cells in the future.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nS.G. and R.L. contributed equally to this work.
