Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The positions  of the second peak in the Ni and Fe R-space of the a-LNF(b-u)  sample are the same   $(3.0\\,\\mathring\\mathrm{A})$   (Figure 3c,d), indicating that Fe and  Ni octahedra are edge-sharing and connected in the manner of  random substitution. Nevertheless, the apparent distance of  the second distinct peaks of Ni and Fe in the a-LNF(t-d) sample  are unmatched (Figure  3c,d), indicating different geometrical  configurations from the a-LNF(b-u) sample. It should be noted  that the peak at   $2.9\\,\\textrm{\\AA}$   was not expected in the LN perovskite  structure  due to the much longer apparent distances   $(\\approx\\!3.9\\:\\mathring\\mathrm{A})$    of corner-sharing neighboring cations and is characteristic of  layered materials.  The apparent distances of the first and  second distinct peaks of the Ni center in the a-LNF(t-d) sample  are shorter than those of the a-LNF(b-u) sample (Figure  3c),  indicating that the pristine corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{Ni}^{3+}\\mathrm{O}_{6}$   octahedra  have been transformed into edge-sharing  $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}O_{6}}$   octahedra (layered) during the collapse of the perovskite structure.  \n\nBased on the above analysis and combining the formation  mechanism of a-LNF(t-d) sample, a unique local geometrical  structure of Ni and Fe was then proposed, in which Ni species presented as layered clusters with molecular dimensions  whereas Fe octahedra were connected with Ni-layered clusters  as interstitial s. The local geometrical symmetry can be revealed  by the relative intensity of the pre-edge peak. The more pronounced pre-edge peak (a transition from 1s to 3d state) of Fe  (7114  eV) in the a-LNF(t-d) (than that of the a-LNF(b-u) and  amorphous FeOOH (Figure S16, Supporting Information) samples) indicates a particularly distorted structure. The distorted  Fe octahedra most likely resulted from its interstitial state. Previous in situ fluorescence-detected XAS and density functional  theory calculations have revealed that distorted octahedra can  significantly enhance the overlap of metal 3d and oxygen 2p  bands, thus efficiently boosting the charge transfer as well as  the OER activity.  Therefore, the unique local geometrical  structure of Ni/Fe in the a-LNF(t-d) sample also promoted the  OER activity. Besides, Fe species distributed uniformly in the  NiFe-based catalysts can be dissolved in the electrolyte under  harsh oxidative conditions.  Fe species that initially incorporated at the surface/edge/defect sites of Ni species can be  moved to the bulk phases during the OER process.  The  above information clearly indicates that NiFe-based catalysts  are dynamically changed under OER conditions. The better  OER stability shown by a-LNF(t-d) than that of the a-LNF(b-u)  sample most likely comes from the different dynamical change  because of the different initial local structures. Further studies  should be performed to track the local structure evolution using  in situ XAS spectroscopy.  \n\nIn summary, through a facile top-down strategy, we constructed an amorphous and nano structured LNF electro cat alyst derived from LN perovskite by selectively dissolving La and  depositing Fe. The as-prepared a-LNF(t-d) possesses the highvalence   $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}}$  -based edge-sharing octahedron frameworks surrounded by distorted Fe octahedra in the manner of interstitial,  which is completely different from the conventional bottomup prepared LNF counterpart.
