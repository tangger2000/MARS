Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

On the other hand,  the electrochemical properties of pure   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  -based materials  are often critically impeded by their poor electric conductivity.  To solve this problem, assembling   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nano structures with  carbon nanotubes or graphene is proved to be an effective  approach.  For example, Yu et al. fabricated ultrathin   ${\\mathrm{MoS}}_{2}$  nanowall arrays anchored on carbon layer hybrids through an  in situ hybridization method and then tested them under a cutoff voltage   $(0.4{-}3.0\\ \\mathrm{V})$  ), which displayed an excellent reversible  capacity of   $120\\;\\mathrm{mArh\\;g^{-1}}$   at a high rate of   $10\\;\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$  .  \n\nIn this work, a kind of hierarchical nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) sheets synthesized by our group is first employed  as a conductive scaffold for growing active nano structures  (Figure S1, Supporting Information).  A simple solvothermal approach is introduced to construct a series of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$    nanosheets (dozens layered   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets:   $\\mathrm{DL}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  ;  few layered   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets:   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Mo}\\mathbb{S}_{2}$  ; ultrasmall   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$    nanosheets:   $\\mathrm{US-MoS_{2}},$  ) anchored on the NG to form the final  hybrid anode materials (denoted as DL  $\\cdot\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@$  NG, and   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG})$  . By rationally changing the raw  sources and solvents, the as-obtained  $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets exhibit  tunable size and number of layers as well as inter planar  spacing. The synthesis routes including the morph o logie s  of the   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  nanosheets are illustrated in  Figure   1 . From the  scanning electron microscopic images, we can recognize that  the three kinds of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets reveal a “standing” feature  and the lateral sizes are about 100–400, 50–100, and   $10{-}50\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  ,  respectively. In addition, the low-resolution observations of  the samples show that both sides of the NG sheets are uniformly covered with   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets, indicating the suitable  in situ hybridization and self-assembly processes (Figure S2,  Supporting information).

As can be seen, a thick   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  nanosheet with dozens of atomic layers can be observed from  the   $\\mathrm{DL}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   composite (Figure 2a). By changing the  sulfur source from th io acetamide to thiourea, the thickness  of the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets decreases to about five to  seven layers (Figure 2b). Figure 2c shows that with the assistant of ethylene glycol, the thickness of the as-obtained   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  nanosheets is further reduced to one to three layers. Moreover,  the interlayer distances of the three samples display a gradually  increasing trend, which can be clearly noticed from Figure 2d–f.  Based on the former results, expanded inter layers of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  could effectively increase the amount of   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   inter cal ation at  a high rate.  This fact is also confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination in Figure 2g, the peaks of (002) plane  for   $\\mathrm{FL}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NC}$   and   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   indicate a slight shift  to the lower scattering angle compared with the DL $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@$  NG. Besides, all of the XRD peaks of the three samples can  be distinctly identified and matched with the JCPDS card  (No. 37–1492) of hexagonal   $2\\mathrm{H}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  . Figure 2h displays the  detailed element distribution for   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   composites  by scanning transmission electron microscopy, revealing a uniform hybridization of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets and nitrogen-doped  graphene again.  \n\nTo determine the accurate elemental composition of the  final products, we choose the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   as an instance  and investigate it by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),  as shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. From  the survey spectrum, we can see that the US  $\\cdot\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   is  constituted by Mo, S, C, N, and O (Figure S3a, Supporting  Information). In detail, two peaks located at 229.6 and  $232.8\\,\\mathrm{eV}$  represent the Mo   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and Mo   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$  , respectively, and suggest the presence of   $\\mathrm{Mo}^{\\mathrm{4+}}$   state in the composite (Figure S3b,  Supporting Information). Two additional peaks at 162.5 and   $163.6\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\,~\\mathrm{eV}}}$   related to   $\\textsl{S2p}_{3/2}$   and S   $\\mathrm{2\\mathfrak{p}_{1/2}}$  of   $S^{2-}$  can be clearly  observed from Figure S3c of the Supporting Information. The  C 1s spectrum (Figure S3d, Supporting Information) shows  three peaks at 284.7   $(\\mathrm{C=C})$  , 286.7 (C-N/C-O), and   $288.9\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}}$   $(\\mathrm{C=O})$  . In Figure S3e of the Supporting Information, the  three de convoluted peaks located at about 398.4, 399.8, and   $401.3\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   can be assigned to the pyridine-like N, pyrrole-like  N, and graphite-like N, respectively.  Furthermore, the  active material   $(\\mathrm{MoS}_{2})$   contents of the samples are tested by  thermo grav i metric analysis, and the curves are revealed in  Figure S4 of the Supporting Information.
