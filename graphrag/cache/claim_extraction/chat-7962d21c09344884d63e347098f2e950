For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.

Besides, thiophene based   $\\pi$  spacer is  employed to keep the molecular planarity and enhance intramolecular  $\\pi{-}\\pi$  interaction due to the small resonance energy of  thienyl segment, which is considered to suppress the thermal  decomposition of OTG molecules under high-temperature  annealing process.   Figure   1 a shows the chemical structures  of three such molecules. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations  demonstrated that a large 2,4-dibutoxy phenyl unit applied  in OTG3 could efficiently hinder the octahedral tilting of the  corner-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   black phase through a strong sterichindrance effect. Such effect increases the formation energy of  ortho rhombi c yellow phase with an edge-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   structure. Moreover, the fact that the carboxyl ate group on OTG  molecules passivated the surface   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   defects further reduced  the non radiative recombination of charge carriers in perovskite  layer.  Consequently, the stable power conversion efficiency of  PSCs with a surface organic capping layer reached   $13.2\\%$   for  the inverted planar structure. More importantly,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   PSCs  with an OTG3 capping layer showed much higher phase stability against moisture than did the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   devices.  The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device retained   $85\\%$   of its initial PCE after  aging for 30 days in ambient air without encapsulation. These  results emphasize the importance of regulating lattice distortion to produce efficient and stable all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   PSCs.  \n\nOTG1, OTG2, and OTG3 molecules were synthesized by  procedures described in our previous reports,  the steps of  synthesis are shown in Figure S1a (Supporting Information).  Figure S1b (Supporting Information) provides the thermograv i metric analysis (TGA) of OTG1, OTG2, and OTG3. All  the samples exhibit negligible weight loss associated with the  decomposition or thermal evaporation of OTG molecules from  20 to   $200\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , indicating their good thermal stability for the  application of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   based devices. The surface pass iv ation  process of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   perovskite was conducted by adding OTG  molecules to a perovskite precursor solution composed of CsI  and   $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$  . The perovskite black phase was formed after a onestep spin-coating procedure and gradient thermal annealing at  90 and   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . The formation of the black phase was attributed  to the fact that the  $\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   intermediate could facilitate transition  to the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   black phase at lower temperature than that of the  traditional method used CsI and  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   as precursor.  Details of  the process are provided in the experimental section. Figure S2  (Supporting Information), which shows the XRD pattern of  pristine  $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$   powder used in perovskite precursor, depicts the  strong peaks at  $11.7^{\\circ}$  ,  $25.9^{\\circ}$  , and   $31.3^{\\circ}$   associated with the (100), \n\n (201), and (310) planes, respectively, of the   $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$   crystal.  \n\nIn order to verify the presence of OTG molecules in the \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   film after thermal annealing process, we re dissolved  the perovskite films in d6-DMSO solvent for nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) measurement,   $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$   NMR spectrums of the  relative samples are plotted in Figure  1b. The corresponding  peaks in  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  –OTG samples are assigned to the H atoms presented on cyano acetic acid   $(8.4{-}8.5\\ \\mathrm{ppm})$  ), thiophene   $\\pi$  spacer   $(7.7{-}8.0\\ \\mathrm{ppm})$  , phenyl unit   $(6.7{-}7.5\\ \\mathrm{ppm})$  ), and the bulk alkyl  chain   $(0.9{-}4.2\\,\\mathrm{\\pmm})$  , respectively. Besides, some works indicate that   $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$   precursor may introduce extra organic cations  called dimethyl ammonium (DMA) into the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite  lattice.  However, the   $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$   NMR peaks at 8.2 and 2.7  ppm  assigned to the amino   $\\left({-\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{H}_{2}}^{+}\\right)$   and methyl   $\\left(\\mathrm{-CH}_{3}\\right)$   groups  of DMA cation   $\\scriptstyle(^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\ \\mathrm{NMR}$   of DMAI is shown in Figure S3 in  the Supporting Information), respectively, are absent in our  perovskite samples. Based on this result, we deduce that the  perovskite film fabricated by this work is all-inorganic rather  than the organic–inorganic hybrid one. Additionally, we employ  time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS)  analysis (Figure  1c) to investigate the vertical distribution of  OTG molecules (indicated by  $\\mathrm{CN^{-}}$  ) in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   film (indicated by  − PbI ), which indicates that OTG molecules mainly serve as a  surface organic capping layer on the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite.  \n\nThe coordinated reaction between the carboxyl ate   $\\scriptstyle(\\mathrm{O=C-O}\\rangle$  )  of OTG molecules and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite was demonstrated  via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Figure   $S4\\mathrm{a}$    (Supporting Information) shows the FTIR spectra of OTG mole­ cules and the CsPbI 3 –OTG mixture. The stretching vibration of  the   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   bond in pure OTG3 was observed at   $1685~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  . The   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   vibration was shifted to a lower wavenumber of   $1671\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$    in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   mixture. The other peaks presented in  1260, 1302, 1425, and   $1579~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   are relative to the vibration  signal of Ar  H,   $_{\\mathsf{C-O-C}}$  ,   $_{\\mathrm{C-H}}$  , and   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$   bonds in the OTG  molecules. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  analysis further confirms the coordination between carboxyl ate  and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   cations, as shown in Figure S4b (Supporting Information). The XPS O 1s spectrum revealed three clear peaks at \n\n  $529.4~\\mathrm{eV}$     $\\mathrm{(Pb-O}$   bond),   $531.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$   bond), and   $532.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   \n\n (\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
