Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

Figure S9 (Supporting Information) shows the element mapping profiles of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   films.  \n\nFigure Â   3 a illustrates the phase stabilizing mechanism of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite with OTG molecules as the surface capping layer. First, OTG molecules in the precursor solution are  thought to act as nucleation sites for the growth of the cubic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   black phase. This step is followed by formation of a  perovskite film with a surface OTG capping layer. After exposure to moisture or another polar solvent, the bulk alkyl chains  of the OTG molecules provide steric hindrance that suppresses  the tilting of the   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   octahedron frameworks, resulting in  hindrance of the phase transition to the ortho rhombi c phase.  We also performed DFT calculations to better understand the  moisture-induced lattice distortion of cubic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  . We simulated the interaction between   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   molecules and cubic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  containing three-layer   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   octahedral units without and  with OTG1, OTG2, and OTG3 at the lattice surface. The generalized gradient approximation in the form of PerdewâBurkeâ Ernzerhof was used for the exchangeâcorrelation function. FigureÂ  3bâe shows the geometry-optimized structures. It is  apparent that the surface   $C s^{+}$   ions moved from their original  positions and approached   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   molecules in pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  This change in position induced a shift of the electron cloud  associated with the   $C s^{+}$   ions and thus caused a tilting of the  adjacent corner-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   frameworks. This result is  similar to the prediction of a previous theoretical calculation based on the ethanol molecule.  In contrast, the theo- retical model of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}$  , which contains large bulk alkyl  groups, showed much less lattice distortion, especially in the  case of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$  . The   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}I{-}P b}$   bond angle indicated  in Figure S10 (Supporting Information) is   $134.5^{\\circ}$   in pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  . This angle is much smaller than the angle of the  corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{[PbI_{6}]^{4-}}$   frameworks in the cubic phase   $(180^{\\circ})$  and approaches the angles of the edge-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   frameworks in the ortho rhombi c phase   $(91.4^{\\circ}$   and   $95.1^{\\circ},$  ). Interestingly, this bond angle increases to   $157.8^{\\circ}$  ,   $170.2^{\\circ}$  , and   $179.4^{\\circ}$   in  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}1$  ,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}2$  , and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   models,  respectively. Other calculations illustrate that the decrease of the   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}I{-}P b}$   bond angle gives rise to a weaker antibonding state  with the overlapping   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{I}$   orbitals. This characteristic has been  shown to cause a reduction of the defect tolerance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  perovskite, which is undesirable for high-performance PSCs. This calculated result is consistent with our experimental  results and highlights the importance of regulating   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   lattice distortion to achieve stable and efficient all-inorganic PSCs. To investigate the impact of the organic capping layer on the  \n\nsurface defect states, we used XPS to examine the Pb 4f core  levels of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   ( Figure Â  4 a). The dominant  peaks (  $7138.0\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   for   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   and   $143.1~\\mathrm{eV}$   for   $4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2})$  ) were associated  with   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   atoms with a saturated coordination, and we attributed the small peaks (asterisks in FigureÂ 4a) at lower binding  energy (  $7136.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   and   $142.0~\\mathrm{eV}$   for   $4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2})$   to the defects  of under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   ions that were associated with the  metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   cluster   $(\\mathrm{Pb}^{0})$  .  Theoretical computations and  experimental studies have indicated that the  $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   defects are the  main source of electronic trap states and serves as a nonradiative recombination center for charge carriers.  By calculating  the peak area ratio of   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   to  $\\operatorname{Pb}4\\mathrm{f},$  , we could estimate the content  of   $\\mathrm{{Pb^{0}}}$   to be   $4.13\\,\\,\\mathrm{{at}\\%}$   and   $0.65{\\mathrm{~atï¿½}}6$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3^{-}}$  OTG3, respectively. This result implies that the organic capping  layer could significantly reduce the density of defects on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   surface.
