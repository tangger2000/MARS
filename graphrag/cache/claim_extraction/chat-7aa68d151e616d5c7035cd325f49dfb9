Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The improved energy band alignment and  thus promoted electron extraction should be primarily respon­ sible for slightly enhanced short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$  .  Interestingly, all photovoltaic parameters were enhanced for  ADAA. The average PCE was enhanced from   $20.19\\,\\pm\\,0.473\\%$    of the control device to   $21.31\\,\\pm\\,0.433\\%$  ,   $21.60\\,\\pm\\,0.315\\%$  , and   $22.25\\:\\pm\\:0.239\\%$   of AD, ADCA, and ADAA-modified devices,  respectively. Figure 6e–h illustrate   $J{-}V$  curves of the champion  devices without and with AD, ADCA, and ADAA. In contrast to  champion control device with a PCE of   $20.95\\%$   (a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of  $1.108\\;\\mathrm{V},$    a  $J_{S C}$   of   $23.31\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and an FF of 0.811), the champion AD-,  ADCA-, and ADAA-modified devices achieved a PCE of   $21.67\\%$   \n\n (a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.121~\\mathrm{V},$  , a   $J_{S C}$   of   $23.48\\ \\mathrm{mA\\cm}^{-2}$   and an FF of 0.824), \n\n  $22.01\\%$   (a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of 1.135 V, a  $J_{S C}$   of   $23.53\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}$   and an FF of \n\n 0.824), and   $22.83\\%$   (a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.170\\,\\mathrm{~V},$   a   $J_{S C}$   of   $23.50\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$    and an FF of 0.831), respectively. The negligible hysteresis was  observed for the control and modified devices. The integrated  current densities from incident photon–to–electron conver­ sion efficiency (IPCE) spectra in Figure S13 (Supporting Infor­ mation) were 22.78, 22.97, 23.20, and   $23.52\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$   for the  control, AD-, ADCA-, and ADAA-modified devices, respec­ tively, which well match with those extracted from   $J{-}V$  curves.  Figure   $6\\mathrm{i-l}$   shows the stable output current density and PCE  as a function of time measured at the maximum power point  for the devices with and without modification. The control, AD,  ADCA, and ADAA modified devices yielded a steady–state cur­ rent density of 21.51, 22.51, 22.63, and   $22.75\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   of after   $800\\ \\mathrm{s}$   and a steady-state PCE of   $20.87\\%$  ,   $21.69\\%$  ,   $21.95\\%$  , and   $22.51\\%$  , respectively. In order to demonstrate universality of our  modification strategy, we fabricated PSCs based on sequential  deposition approach by incorporating ADAA interface modifier  and the champion  $J{-}V$   curves are exhibited in Figure   $6\\mathrm{m}$  . The  PCE was increased from   $22.01\\%$   of the control device to   $23.18\\%$    after ADAA modification. This demonstrates that ADAA modi­ fication molecule is highly promising in pas siva ting inter facial  defects regardless of perovskite compositions and preparation  method.  \n\nLong-term stability is crucial to the industrialization of  perovskite photovoltaics. Therefore, we investigated the effects  of AD, ADCA, and ADAA modification on device stability. The  humidity stability of the unsealed devices was carried out under  an ambient condition with a relative humidity of  $20–30\\%$   in the  dark. After aging for   $1200\\mathrm{~h~}$  , the control device retained   $76.1\\%$    of the initial PCE while the AD, ADCA, and ADAA modified  devices retained   $82.2\\%$  ,   $86.7\\%$  , and   $92.4\\%$   of the initial PCEs,  respectively ( Figure    $\\mathrm{7a}$  ). To understand the origin of improved  moisture stability, we performed contact angle measurement  for the control and modified perovskite films with AD, ADCA,  and ADAA (Figure  S14 Supporting Information). Slightly  increased contact angles were found after interface modifica­ tion. This shows that improved moisture stability is partially  because of increased hydrophobic it y. Thermal stability of the  unsealed devices was performed on a hot plate at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in a  dark nitrogen-filled glove box. After aging for   $1000\\,\\mathrm{h}$  , the control  device had only   $45\\%$  of the initial PCE, while the AD, ADCA,  and ADAA modified devices maintained  $70\\%$  ,  $75\\%$  , and   $81\\%$   of  the initial PCEs, respectively, as shown in Figure 7b. Obviously,  the thermal stability was improved significantly after interface  modification.

As we discussed previously, reduced defect  density and released stress would contribute to enhancing  both PCE and stability. Consequently, the improved stability  is mainly attributed to reduced inter facial defect density and  released inter facial stress. In a word, the interface molecules in  this study can not only enhance PCE but also stability.  \n\n# 3. Conclusions  \n\nIn summary, we propose steric-hindrance-dependent buried  interface defect pass iv ation and stress release strategy, which  is implemented by adopting a series of adamantane molecules  functional i zed with   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   (i.e., AD, ADCA, and ADAA) to  modify   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}O_{2/}}$  /perovskite interface. It is demonstrated that all  adamantane derivative molecules play a role in pas siva ting  inter facial defects, mitigating inter facial strain and enhancing  device performance. The steric hindrance of chemical interac­ tion between   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   in these molecules and per ovsk ites as well  as   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   is determined by the distance from   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   to bulky  adamantane ring, which gradually decreases from AD, ADCA,  and ADAA. The steric-hindrance-dependent defect pass iv ation  effect is disclosed experimentally and theoretically.
