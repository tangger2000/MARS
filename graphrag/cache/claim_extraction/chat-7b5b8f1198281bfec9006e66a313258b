Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The doping of para magnetic   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  ions induces a shift of the  $^{133}\\mathrm{Cs}$   peak from 103.3 to 101.1 ppm as  well as a significant broadening of this signal (the full-width-athalf-height increases from 173 to   $300~\\mathrm{Hz}$  ) (Figure 1d).  The  shift of peak position is due to the delocalization of extra electron density of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   (spin  $I=1/2$   and   $3/2$  ) on   $C s^{+}$  , that  is, the Fermi-contact interaction. The broadening of NMR peak  corresponds to the accelerated transverse   $\\left(T_{2}\\right)$   relaxation of  $^{133}\\mathrm{Cs}$  in the presence of adjacent para magnetic   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   ions,  resulting from the strong dipolar coupling between unpaired  electrons and   $^{133}C s$   nuclei (i.e., the pseudo-contact interaction).  \n\nThe longitudinal   $(T_{1})$   relaxation constant also decreases from  218 to   $101\\ \\mathrm{s}$  in the   $\\mathrm{{Yb}^{3+}/E r}^{3+}$  -doped sample (Figure 1e).  The   $\\mathrm{Cs{-}C l{-}I n/B i}$   environment is strongly affected by paramagnetic   ${\\mathrm{RE}}^{3+}$   ions (inset of Figure  1d). In the double perovskite  structure, the very high spherical symmetry at   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$   enables the  acquisition of high-resolution   ${}^{115}\\mathrm{In}$   spectra (Figure  1f). Two   ${}^{115}\\mathrm{In}$   peaks were observed at 51.9 and 40.1 ppm in both samples,  respectively. Similar to the   $\\mathrm{Cs{-Cl}{-B i}/I n}$   the environment, the  more de-shielded peak at   $51.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$   is assigned to the   $\\mathrm{In-Cl-Ag}$  environment whereas the 40.1 ppm peak is In − Cl − Na (Insert of  Figure 1f).  The higher intensity of the peak at 40.1 ppm in  the RE-free sample is also consistent with its higher concentration of Na. After the   $\\mathrm{{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}}}$  -doping, the relative intensity of  the peak at   $40.1\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$   decreased dramatically. The results from \n\n  $\\ {}^{133}\\bar{\\mathrm{Cs}}$   and   $^{115}\\mathrm{In}\\,\\mathrm{SSNR}$   $\\mathrm{{Yb}^{3+}/E r}^{3+}$   ions have been successfully incorporated into the  double perovskite lattice.  Furthermore, the   $\\mathrm{{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}}}$   ions  are not distributed randomly in the sample: the effect of paramagnetic ions is distinct for   $\\mathrm{Cs{-Cl}{-}I n}$   and Cs − Cl − Bi environments, as well as In − Cl − Ag and In − Cl − Na environments. The   $\\mathrm{{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}}}$   ions are likely adjacent to the Cs − Cl − Bi and  In − Cl − Na environments.  \n\nSince the absorption coefficient of the material is highly  dependent on the specific element composition, we have further applied scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive  spectrometry (SEM-EDS) and EDS-mapping to analyze the  composition of each compound (Figure S2 ‒ S9, Supporting  Information). All the elements are evenly distributed in the  images, with no element enrichment, which indicates that  there was no phase separation in the as-prepared perovskite  materials. According to the EDS spectra, the content and proportion of   $C s^{+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  ,  $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$  , and   $C\\mathrm{l^{-}}$   are in good accordance  with the expected values (Table S3, Supporting Information).  Owing to low doping contents of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}/B i^{3+}}$   in RE-1,   $\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}/$   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   co-doped RE-2, and RE-3, their contents were barely detectable by SEM-EDS. Therefore, the inductively coupled plasma  mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was used to further determine the  precise amounts of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   in the as-prepared samples.  \n\nThe sum of these trivalent ions was calculated to determine the  content proportion of each specific ion. The content of each ion  in the compounds is   $99.38\\%$   for   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$  ,   $0.3\\%$   for   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  ,   $0.08\\%$   for   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  , and   $0.24\\%$   for  $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   in RE-1;   $99.51\\%$   for   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$  ,   $0.4\\%$   for   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$  ,  and   $0.09\\%$   for   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   in RE-2;   $99.25\\%$   for  $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$  ,   $0.6\\%$   for  $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  , and   $0.15\\%$   for   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   in RE-3 (Table S4, Supporting Information).  \n\nThe sample RE-1, RE-2, RE-3, and RE-4 are pale yellow single  crystals under natural light. As shown in  Figure  $^{2\\mathrm{a-b}}$  , the samples have no emission with the light off or in the darkroom.  Under X-ray excitation, only RE-1 emits the yellow-white light.
