Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Building services  including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are major components of building  energy consumption, contributing   ${\\approx}50\\%$    of the total building energy (Figure 1a).   Reducing the energy consumption of these  services while maintaining building comfort levels is a significant challenge in sustainable development.  Among all building  components, windows are considered to be  one of the least energy-efficient parts as  there is always heat transfer in the opposite  direction to that desired.  \n\nArchitectural windows that smartly regulate indoor solar radiation by  changing their optical transmittance in response to thermo stimuli are developed as a promising solution toward reducing the energy consumption of  buildings. Recently, energy-efficient smart window technology has attracted  increasing scientific interest, with the exploration of energy-efficient novel  materials as well as integration with practical techniques to generate various  desired multi functionalities. This review systematically summarizes emerging  thermo responsive materials for smart window applications, including hydrogels, ionic liquids, per ovsk ites, meta materials, and liquid crystals. These  are compared with vanadium dioxide   $(\\mathsf{v o}_{2})$  , a conventional and extensively  studied material for thermo chromic smart window applications. In addition,  recent progress on cutting-edge integrated techniques for smart windows  is covered, including electro thermal techniques, self-cleaning, wet t ability,  and also integration with solar cells for bi functional energy conservation and  generation. Finally, opportunities and challenges relating to thermo chromic  smart windows and prospects for future development are discussed.  \n\nIn recent times, smart windows have  received considerable attention because of  their potentially significant contribution  to the eco no miz ation of building energy  consumption.  A window can regulate  indoor solar irradiation in a “smart” way,  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nthat is, by dynamically and reversibly tuning the transmittance of ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) solar radiation.  Development of smart windows can mainly be categorized as electro-, thermo-, and photo­ stimulated optical response  changes (Figure 1b).  Among them, smart windows based on  thermo responsive materials are highly competitive due to their  unique characteristics: 1) low cost, arising from their simple configuration resulting in low fabrication and maintenance costs,  especially compared to electro chromic smart windows that are  composed of electrolyte, electrodes require an additional power  system and other features (Figure 1b); 2) passivity, with their  automatic response to temperature cutting down the need for  switch systems, for example electrical control requiring external  energy and human manipulation; 3) rational stimulus response,  with regulation by indoor temperature rather than UV-triggered  optical modulation in photo chromic materials.  \n\nThe growing world population and rapid modernization have  led to increased energy demand, necessitating highly efficient  energy use.  Building energy usage accounts for up to   $40\\%$   of  \n\nConventional studies of thermo chromic smart windows  have mainly focused on vanadium dioxide   $\\left(\\mathrm{VO}_{2}\\right)$  , which undergoes a metal–insulator transition at the critical temperature   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{c}})$   of   $68\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , accompanied with huge transmittance contrast  in the IR range and negligible change in the visible range.   The integrated luminous transmittance   $(T_{\\mathrm{lim}})$   and the integrated solar energy modulation   $(\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}})$   are two key parameters  to assess performance, for which calculation methods can be  found in previous reports.  Extensive efforts have been put  into optimizing   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$   and  $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   by nano/microscale engineering,  including porosity, nano composites, biomimetic design, grids,  and multilayer s.  However, challenges regarding pure   $\\mathrm{V}\\mathrm{O}_{2^{-}}$  based smart windows still remain regarding the relatively high   $\\tau_{c}$   intrinsic yellow-brown color and low resistance to oxidization; more importantly the unfavorable combination of low   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$   and   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}},$  , which are less than   $50\\%$   and   $20\\%$  , respectively,  in most researches.  \n\nThere is emerging scientific interest in the exploration of  new temperature-responsive materials. Feasible materials must  be able to switch automatically between transmitted and scattered/blocked to solar radiation, with a huge contrast at cold  and warm seasons. Other key considerations include a suitable  transition temperature range   $(30–40\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  , outstanding durability, acceptable appearance, facile, and low cost of manufacture and maintenance. Additionally, various demands arising  from the practical market have increased research attention on  multi functional smart windows as well as functional thermochromic devices, which could be achieved by integration with  other state-of-the-art techniques.  \n\nIn this review, emerging thermo responsive materials for  smart window applications are first outlined and discussed,  including hydrogels, ionic liquids, per ovsk ites, meta materials,  and liquid crystals ( Figure   2 , right). The respective mechanisms  of each material are presented with emphasis on the thermally  induced optical property change. The following section further  compares these materials with conventional thermo chromic   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   (Figure 2, right). Subsequently, recent achievements in  integrated techniques for thermo responsive smart windows  are summarized, including the electro thermal technique,  self-cleaning, wet t ability, and integration with solar cells \n\n (SCs) for energy conservation and generation bi functionality \n\n (Figure 2, left). Finally, prospects for future development are  discussed, from both material and integrated device perspectives. Considering the enormous library of thermo responsive  materials and integrated techniques, great opportunities in this  field remain. The objective of this review is to broaden research  interests and inspire further innovative approaches to accelerate  the development of energy-efficient smart window technologies.  \n\n# 2. Emerging Thermal-Responsive Materials  \n\n# 2.1. Hydrogels  \n\nHydrogels are networks of hydrophilic polymer chains with  an aqueous-rich environment which renders broadly tunable  chemical and physical properties. The first hydrogel was demonstrated in 1894.  Nowadays, hydrogels have been applied in  different areas, including tissue engineering,  drug delivery  systems,  cell cultures,  and biological implants.  \n\nRecently, thermo chromic hydrogels, a special category of  hydrogels, have attracted considerable attention as a candidate for energy-efficient smart window applications. The  extensively studied thermo chromic hydrogels include polyampholyte hydrogel (PAH),  poly( N -isopropyl a cry l amide)  (PNIPAm),  and hydroxy prop yl cellulose (HPC).  Significantly, thermo chromic hydrogels undergo a hydrophilic  to hydrophobic transition ( Figure   3 a): when the temperature is below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST),  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/4a047234d794f2359687dc98897b5849de0634d5ed528cd626b4a69122d31c27-1727078106.jpg)  \n\nYujie Ke  obtained his bachelor and master degrees  from Wuhan Institute of  Technology, China, in 2013,  and University at Buffalo,  the State University of New  York (SUNY-Buffalo), USA, in  2015, respectively.
