Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Taking the fingertip area   $(\\approx\\!2\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   as the proper device  size, the first-generation commercial wearable imagers should  at least reach a pixel density of about   $10^{4}~\\mathrm{{cm}^{-2}}$   to satisfy the  QR code recognition, and the next-generation products should  reach   $1.5\\times10^{5}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   for basic object photographing. The synthesis of photosensitive nano structures is no longer a bottleneck, but the fabrication of highly integrated detector arrays  along with the electric circuits is still a huge challenge, which  is the key to the scanning process in fast imaging. Real-time  imaging is necessary in some cases, but the perceived image  immediately fades away as the incident signal stops, which is  inconvenient for signal processing. Combining visual memory  mode with imaging enables a multi functional integration  to achieve electronic visions like human eyes. As showed in  Figure 7c,  a memristor was integrated with   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   nanowire  photo conductor to store the perceived data, and a biomimetic  visual memory system was developed on flexible substrates.  The stored information could be erased under reverse bias,  indicating a controllable vision memory function for further  signal processing. Apart from the device structures, more attention should be paid to the electric insulation and signal interference among different pixels during the bending process.  Advanced fabrication strategies with an improved geometry  accuracy may contribute to the commercial application of flexible imagers for wearable photonic-electronic systems.  \n\n# 3.3. Wearable Optical Communication  \n\nWearable optical communication can serve as the bridge of  wearable systems, which connects various wearable devices for  further data processing, human interaction, and result display.  In a word, wearable optical communication catalyzes advanced  applications on the basis of wearable devices. Wearable visible  light communication has been achieved in previous reports.  In the research of Fink and co-workers,  fiber-shaped photo­ diodes were integrated with fiber-shaped LEDs to construct a  communication system with the ability to remotely transmit  data at a distance of   $1\\,\\textrm{m}$   from each other (see  Figure    8 b).  Although visible light and UV communication have embraced  great progress in the past decade, IR light (typical wavelengths:  850, 1310, and   $1550\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) still dominates the optical communication owing to their low signal attenuation. Massive related  applications have been developed including remote control, distance measuring, data communication, and radar systems. Thereby, researchers in this field still pay dominant attention  to IR photo sensitivity to facilitate distance communication and  cater to the wearable requirements of “Internet of Things.” As  stated above, two-electrode device architectures like photodiodes and photo conductors play an important role in UV or visible light detection, which are well adapted to lateral structures.  However, the photosensitive materials in IR photodetector s are  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/dce756756f7cea796d81c5f3b6cfbf6647f63f42ea509f83cd7adfd031a1fe6a-1727123043.jpg)  \nFigure 8.   a) A wearable visible light communication system based on a fiber-like LED and photodetector s.

Thus, current IR photodetector s are generally  based on three-electrode architectures, where additional vertical  gate electrode is introduced to provide the gate bias voltage.  The gate bias suppresses the lateral dark current due to the  field-effect modulation and thus guarantees an adequate on/off  ratio for signal resolution.  \n\nHowever, the introduction of gate electrode is incompatible  with most flexible photodetector s in previous reports. Lateral  designs no longer support three-electrode devices and vertical  multilayer structures are necessary to realize the device architecture of IR photo sensors. The multilayer structures not only  complicate the device fabrication but also introduce potential  problems to the photoelectric properties. Therefore, special  attention should be paid to the film quality, vertical gate contact, interlayer insulation, and dielectric interlayer. Although  highly miniaturized inflexible devices may fulfill the wearable  requirements, flexibility is still a preferred property for wearable systems, especially for large-area occasions.  \n\nRigid island device is a promising route to achieve flexibility  with inflexible components, which has the potential to inherit  the merits of inflexible structures simultaneously. This strategy  has been reported in some flexible photodetector structures. In  report of Zhang el al.,  miniaturized silicon p–i–n photo­ diodes are spliced to form a flexible origami silicon hemispherical electronic eye systems, which delivered an excellent  omni directional photo response. In the work of Rogers and  co-workers,  the flexible rigid island structures was systematically designed to diminish the warping strain (Figure 8b). The  rigid island photodetector remains inflexible while delivering a  general flexibility, avoiding the performance deterioration from  deformation and bending stress. Similar flexible method could  also be applied to various inflexible three-electrode photodetectors, including traditional photo-FETs and novel gate-related  devices like hybrid photo-FETs  and photo voltage field-effect  transistors.  Therefore, rigid island approach provides abundant flexibility for the device construction, which holds the  potential for further usage in IR photodetector s.  \n\nDespite the existing problems, the development in flexible  transistors still inspires a potential route apart from the rigid  island approach to construct flexible optical communication  systems.  Unlike the inflexible photo transistors, the photo­ sensitive channel suffers strong bending stress in flexible  transistors, and traditional inorganic films become unsuitable  due to the increased fracture risk and possible vertical shortcircuit. Thus, flexible photo transistors require semiconducting  materials with excellent bending resistance, such as conductive  polymers  and 2D materials.  Although few IR-photosensitive photo transistors have been reported, the advances of  novel materials  may effectively contribute to considerable  achievements in this field.  \n\nIn brief summary, the wearable optical communication systems are still underdeveloped with potential routes and existing  problems. The reliance on gate-based field-effect modulation  sets difficulties to the flexible requirements, but rigid island  approach and flexible transistor have been reported as potential solutions. With the help of the developing novel materials,  wearable optical communication systems will eventually lead  promising future applications as the development of “Internet  of Things” as shown in Figure 8c.  \n\n# 4. Conclusions and Outlook  \n\nTo date, transformation from rigid bulky photodetector s to  flexible and even stretch able and deformable devices has been  explored by researchers worldwide through careful selection  of materials, elaborated design of device configuration and  assembly technique.  \n\nFor 2D wearable PDs, including polymer and paper substrate-based devices, geometrical forms such as wave, spring,  hinges, etc., have been effectively applied to substrates or  electrodes to endow the devices with flexibility. Those ideas  masterly leverage the relation between micro mechanics and  materials to turn “hard” devices to “soft.” However, a lack of  theoretical guidance, which may estimate the mechanical  robustness of each layer in a device under deformation and  help build the ideal device layout for designated applications,  becomes the current bottleneck. Only through a richer database  of the physical properties of materials in any form and a more  mature model between micro structural mechanic properties of  device and materials, can 3D printing and artificial intelligence  be easily cooperated in the process of developing versatile lowcost high-performance wearable PDs.  \n\nFor 1D wearable PDs, a twisting structure is typically  employed in the fiber-shaped devices, that is, a core metal wire  electrode incorporated with photo active materials and entwined  by the other electrode. Carbon nanotube fibers/graphene  fibers have been demonstrated as good candidates as the outer  electrodes, however, their conduct iv i ties are less satisfying   $(\\approx\\!10^{3}\\:\\mathrm{~S~}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ), especially in meters-long. Moreover, neither  metal nor carbon-based electrodes are transparent. As transparent electrodes are always desired in op to electronics, developing transparent flexible highly conducting materials are  of great importance in wearable photodetector s. Attempts  like Ag nanowires/PDMS composite materials have shown  some potentials, with Ag network as the conducting phase  and polymer as the flexible matrix, future studies may further  improve the conduct iv i ties of the composite materials while  keeping the transparency through nano structure and microstructure design.  \n\nFor a wearable PD, other than flexibility, more stringent  requirements need to be\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
