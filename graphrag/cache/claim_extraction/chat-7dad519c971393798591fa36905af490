Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi) was applied to detect  the elemental chemical state of the HE oxide ceramics. The morph o logie s  were observed on a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM,  JEOL JSM-7001F), and the corresponding electron back scatter diffraction  (EBSD) maps were collected. The defects and vacancies were detected  using an electron spin resonance spectrometer (ESR, JEOL JES FA200).  The micro structure and high-resolution micro structure were characterized  via transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F) using  an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford) and spherical  aberration-corrected TEM (FEI Titan Cubed G2 300) associated with a  Super-X energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector, respectively. The  magnetic properties of HE oxide ceramics were analyzed using a vibrating  sample magneto meter (VSM, LakeShore-7404). The sample used for the  TEM characterization was prepared using the focused ion beam slicing  technique (FIB, Helios   ${\\mathsf{G}}4~{\\mathsf{C}}{\\mathsf{X}})$  ). An ion beam was generated by a metal  ion source, then, it was accelerated by an ion gun, focused, and irradiated  on the sample surface to peel the surface atoms with a strong current ion  beam for complete the micro- and nano-surface morphology processing.  To prevent Ga-ion beam damage, a   $1.2~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   thick Pt layer comprising a   $200\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   thick electron beam-assisted formed Pt layer and a   $1~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   thick  Ga-ion beam-assisted deposited Pt layer was utilized.  Additional  characterizations are presented in Supporting Information.  \n\nThe EM parameters, i.e., the relative complex permittivity   $(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}\\ =$     $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}-j\\varepsilon^{\\prime\\prime})$   and permeability   $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{r}}=\\mu^{\\prime}-j\\mu^{\\prime\\prime})$   were determined by a vector  network analyzer (Keysight, N5234A) using the wave-guide method  in the frequency range of   $8.2{-}12.4~\\mathsf{G H z}$  , where the HE oxides were  cut into samples with dimensions of   $22.8\\ \\mathsf{m m}\\times10.1\\ \\mathsf{m m}\\times2.5\\ \\mathsf{m m}$    for measurements.  According to the metal back-panel theory, the  reflection loss (RL), which represents the microwave absorption  performance, was simulated based on the tested EM parameters as  follows:  \n\n$$\nR L=20\\mathsf{l o g}_{10}\\big|\\big(Z_{\\mathsf{i n}}-Z_{0}\\big)/\\big(Z_{\\mathsf{i n}}+Z_{0}\\big)\\big|\n$$  \n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathsf{i n}}\\!=\\!Z_{0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{r}}{\\varepsilon_{r}}}}\\mathsf{t a n h}\\!\\left(j{\\frac{2\\pi t f{\\sqrt{\\mu_{r}\\varepsilon_{r}}}}{c}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere  $Z_{\\mathsf{i n}}$   and   $Z_{0}=377~\\Omega$   denote the material impedance and vacuum  impedance, respectively;   $t,~c$  , and  $f$  represent the absorber thickness,  velocity of light, and measured frequency, respectively. When the RL  is below   $^{-10}$    dB,   $90\\%$   microwave attenuation was expected. Here, the  frequency range with RL below  − 10 dB was considered as the effective  absorbing bandwidth   $(f_{\\mathsf{E}},$  \n\nDensity Functional Theory Calculations : The density functional theory  (DFT) computations were performed using the Cambridge Sequential  Total Energy Package. In this study, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)  function's generalized gradient approximation was employed. With a  kinetic energy cutoff of   $500~\\mathrm{eV},$   the planewave basis was used to expand  the electron wave function. The mesh of   $K$   points was set at   $\\rceil\\times\\rceil\\times\\rceil$  .  To prevent picture interactions, vacuum layers of   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$   were used to  separate the periodic images. The model of spinel/perovskite HE oxides  was sliced from the (110) and (111) planes for the perovskite and spinel  phases, respectively, with different thickness. The model of rock salt/ spinel HE oxides was sliced from the (220) plane for the rock salt and  spinel phases with varied thickness, respectively. Moreover, oxygen  vacancies were generated on the interface for better description of the  samples. During geometry optimization, all atoms were allowed to relax.  The energy convergence criterion was   $10{-}5~{\\mathrm{eV}}$   and the final forces were   ${<\\!0.01\\!\\mathrm{~}\\!\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\bar{\\mathsf{A}}^{\\cdot1}}$   at each atom.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors appreciate the financial supports from the National Natural  Science Foundation of China (52231007, 51725101, 11727807, 61790581,  22088101, 52271167), the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (973  Project Nos. 2018 Y FA 0209100 and 2021 Y FA 1200600), the Shanghai Excellent  Academic/Technological Leaders Program (19 XD 1400400), the Foundation  for University Youth Key Teachers of Henan Province (2020 GG JS 170), the  Science Foundation for The Excellent Youth Scholars of Henan Province  (212300410089), the Support Program for Scientific and Technological  Innovation Talents of Higher Education in Henan Province (21 HAST IT 004),  and and Key Research Project of Zhejiang Lab (No. 2021 PE 0 AC 02).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Data Availability Statement  \n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the  corresponding author upon reasonable request.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ndefects, dual-phases, high-entropy oxides, inter facial polarizations,  microwave absorption s  \n\nReceived: August 27, 2022 Revised: September 28, 2022 Published online: October 27, 2022  \n\nH. Bi, C. Liang, K. Yuan, W. She, Y. Yang, R. Che,  Adv.
