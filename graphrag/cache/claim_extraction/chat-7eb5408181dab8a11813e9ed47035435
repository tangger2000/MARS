The pinholes in perovskite  films fabricated from pure DMF and DMSO did not disappear.  While the perovskite films prepared by mixed solvent have  no pinholes in sight. This is because in ethanol atmosphere,  the MAI is dissolved and continue to react with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . As for  perovskite films based on pure DMF and DMSO, pinholes in  the film will be intensified by annealing the solvent annealing.  As a result, the grain size and compactness of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  film are improved after solvent annealing, which is consisted  with the film morphology. Compact films with larger grain  sizes decrease the number of grain boundaries and density of  defects, which are favorable to improve the photovoltaic performance.  In addition,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods passivated with a  thin  $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   layer improve charge collection in the PSCs, which  is confirmed by the transient PL spectra of different perovskite films and  $J{-}V$  curves shown in Figure 6k,l. As a result,  the combination of the three methods boosts the PCE of PSCs  to   $17.3\\%$  , which is the highest efficiency for ZnO nanorods  based PSCs.  \n\n# 5. PSCs Based on Other ZnO Nano structures  \n\n# 5.1. ZnO Nanowalls  \n\n$\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls are a kind of sponge-like   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanostructures with a large 2D framework and surface area, and like   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods, this structure offers a large contact area and  direct electron transport path. As a result,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls  have been widely used in energy storage devices and biosensors because of their larger surface area than nanorods. Tang  et al. synthesized   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls by a low temperature chemical bath method and fabricated PSCs based the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowall  ETM.  In this research, Al was first deposited on ITO surface as template before the growth of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls. Equimolar   $\\mathrm{Zn(CH}_{3}\\mathrm{COO)}_{2}\\!\\cdot\\!2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   and hex a methylene tetra mine  were dissolved in water to fabricate precursor solution, and  then   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls were grown on the substrate by chemical  bath process. After the deposition of perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD  HTM, and   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   electrode, PSCs with structure of   $\\mathrm{ITO/Z n O}$   nanowalls/perovskite/HTM/Ag were obtained. A planar PSC based  on ZnO compact film was prepared as a control device. The  compact  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film for planar PSC was prepared by spin coating  the precursor solution composed of   $\\mathrm{Zn(CH}_{3}\\mathrm{COO)}_{2}\\!\\cdot\\!2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   and  mono ethanol amine on the ITO substrate.  \n\nThe best performance PSC based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls produced a  $J_{S C}$   of  $18.9\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.0\\;\\mathrm{V},$   FF of  $72.1\\%$  , and PCE  of   $13.6\\%$  . While, the control device shows a  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of  $18.6\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $0.98~\\mathrm{V},$  , FF of   $62\\%$  , and PCE of   $11.3\\%$  . The introduction  of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls leads to an obvious improvement in the FF  and PCE of the PSCs. This is because   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls offer  much larger contact area between   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and perovskite material  than the planar   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film, which improves the electron collection and transportation efficiency at perovskite/  $\\mathrm{{}^{\\circ}Z n O}$   nanowalls  interface. Moreover, because of the alkaline behavior of the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   surface, the perovskite will be decomposed by   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and  lead to formation of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   on the interface of perovskite/  $\\mathrm{^{\\prime}Z n O}$  ,  and the presence of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   can suppress the surface recombination and improve the FF.  \n\nHowever,   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   from perovskite decomposition obviously  cannot be controlled. In addition,   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   was not discovered in  perovskite on compact   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film (control device) according to  their research. This indicates that surface of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls is  more reactive than compact  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film, which means that perovskite on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowalls is more unstable. This is harmful to  the reproducibility and performance of PSCs.  \n\n# 5.2. ZnO Nanowires  \n\n$\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires are another widely used 1D structures, which  are similar to nanorods. Beneficial due to their high aspect ratio  and good crystallization,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires are efficient to provide large surface area and improve the electron transport. As  a result,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires have been widely used and studied in  DSSCs.  But researches about PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nano­ wires were deficient.  \n\nHu et al. reported a flexible PSC based on a single   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanowire.  In their research, the ZnO nanowires were fabricate via a vapor–liquid–solid process developed by Zhu et al.  \n\nAfter the growth of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires, a single nanowire was  transferred onto a polystyrene substrate and fixed by silver paste  electrode.   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and spiro-OMeTAD are subsequently deposited on one end of the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   wire to form the solar cell. The  PSCs based on single   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowire show a PCE of   $0.0338\\%$  ,  the extremely low PCE is mainly due to the small effective illumination area of the PSC.  \n\nMoreover, they found that the piezo-photo tronic effect of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires can improve the performance of PSCs based  on  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires obviously. The PCE increased from   $0.0338\\%$  under  $0\\%$   strain to  $0.139\\%$   under   $0.47\\%$   strain. This is because  when an external force is applied, the piezo-photo tronic effect  leads to a shift of the conduction band and suppresses the  interface recombination, which results in the higher   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  .  This method indicates that   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires are efficient ETM  for PSCs, while confined to the micrometer scale effective illumination area, the PCE of PSCs is extremely low. However, the  small size of flexible PSCs based on single  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires may  have potential applications in integrated devices. Moreover,  the studies on performance enhancement due to piezoelectric  effects provide a new approach to improve the properties of  PSCs.  \n\n# 5.3.
