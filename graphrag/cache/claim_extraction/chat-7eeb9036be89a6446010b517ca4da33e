Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In the case of  G3 device, although the FF can be further increased to 0.67,  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  is decreased to   $19.3\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , leading to a slightly lower PCE.  The decreased   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   can be ascribed to the fact that more layers  of graphene imply a lower transmittance.  Therefore, the  optimum PCE of the as-fabricated flexible PSCs is a compromise  between the conductivity and the transmittance of the graphene  electrode. Integrating the incident photon to current efficiency \n\n (IPCE) spectra, Figure 2b, yielded photo current densities of 19.9, \n\n 19.2, and  $18.4\\mathrm{\\:mA\\:cm}^{-2}$   for the flexible PSCs fabricated with G1,  G2, and G3 electrodes, respectively, which were consistent (less  than  $6\\%$   deviation) with the measured  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   from the scanned  $J{-}V$  curves. Impedance spectroscopy was used to clarify the charge  recombination behaviors. Only one semicircle arc was observed  in the Nyquist plots in dark (Figure S5, Supporting Information),  which could be attributed to the overall recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}}).^{[40,41]}$   It is found that the  $R_{s}$   (series resistance) among these  three devices is in the order of   $R_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\mathrm{G}3)\\mathrm{\\textless\\!R_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\mathrm{G}2)\\textless\\!R_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\mathrm{G}1)}$  , and the   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   values for the G2- and G3-based solar cells were significantly  higher than that of G1-based device, indicating a lower recombination rate in the G2- and G3-based devices.  \n\nFigure   3 a presents the   $J{-}V$   curves of G2-based solar cells  fabricated with or without additional spiro-OMeTAD hole  transport conductor. The extracted photovoltaic parameters  are summarized in Table S3 (Supporting Information). The  G2-based flexible PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD show negligible   $J{-}V$   hysteresis, with the PCEs of   $11.9\\%$   and   $11.1\\%$   measured  under reverse and forward scans, respectively. Encouragingly,  the hole-conductor-free flexible PSC also achieved promising  PCEs of   $8.4\\%$   and   $6.4\\%$   measured under reverse and forward  scans, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is also  the first demonstration on the hole-conductor-free carbon back  electrode-based flexible PSCs. The photo current densities of  the flexible PSCs near their maximum power points were stabilized to 17.4 and   $13.5\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (Figure 3b), yielding stabilized  PCEs of   $11.4\\%$   and   $7.7\\%$   for the flexible devices with or without  spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Moreover, the incorporation of  the spiro-OMeTAD hole conductor also increased the average  efficiency of the flexible PSCs (  $'10.2\\,\\pm\\,1.2\\%$   vs   $7.1\\;\\pm\\;1.3\\%,$  ,  Figure S6, Supporting Information). To elucidate the effect of  spiro-OMeTAD on the device performance, the charge-carrier  dynamics in pristine and CSCNT-containing perovskite films  were investigated using a steady-state PL measurement. For  comparison, the sample of pristine perovskite interfaced with  spiro-OMeTAD was also examined. The steady-state PL result  is shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). The pristine  perovskite film shows an intense PL emission peak at around   $770\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . In the presence of a charge-extraction layer (CSCNTs,  spiro-OMeTAD, or CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD), the PL of the  pristine perovskite film was strongly quenched, indicating a  rapid extraction of charges across the interfaces after photon  excitation. TRPL spectroscopy was further used to evaluate the  charge-carrier dynamics quantitatively, as shown in Figure 3c.  The pristine perovskite film exhibited a long charge-carrier lifetime of   $\\tau_{10}=185$   ns (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information,   $\\tau_{10}$   is the time at which the initial PL intensity decreases by a  factor of   $10^{[42,43]}$  ). In comparison, the charge-carrier lifetime  \n\nof perovskite films decreased obviously when interfaced with  CSCNT (  $\\tau_{10}=46$   ns), and spiro-OMeTAD (  $\\tau_{10}=17$   ns). Moreover, the charge transfer from the perovskite to the CSCNT– spiro-OMeTAD (  $\\tau_{10}\\,=\\,6$   ns) was more rapid than that from  perovskite to that of CSCNT or spiro-OMeTAD, indicating that  the CSCNT and spiro-OMeTAD can synergistic ally facilitate the  charge extraction and transportation. The sufficient hole extraction and transportation could considerably hinder the negative  ionic charge accumulation at the   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}/$  charge contact interfaces, which ultimately resulted in higher PCEs and  negligible   $J{-}V$  hysteresis in the CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD-based  flexible PSCs.  In addition, it is worth noting that in this  study all-carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs (with or without  spiro-OMeTAD) also demonstrated higher PCEs compared with  other kinds of all-carbon-electrode-based solar cells (Figure 3d),  including all-carbon-solar cells   $(\\approx\\!5.7\\:\\times\\:10^{-3}\\%)$  ,  all-carbonfiber-electrode-based dye-sensitized solar cells   $(<\\!2\\%)$  ,  and  all graphene-electrode-based organic solar cells   $(3.4\\%)$  .  \n\nThe mechanical flexibility of all-carbon-electrode-based  flexible PSCs was evaluated by bending at different bending  curvature and bending cycles. First, the bending test was  performed with different curvature radii, from 8 to   $2.2~\\mathrm{mm}$    under 200 bending cycles ( Figure   4 a). For comparison, reference ITO-based flexible PSCs with the standard structure  of   $\\mathrm{PEN/ITO/TiO_{2}/P C B M/C H_{3}N H_{3}P b I_{3}/}$  /spiro-OMeTAD/Au  (ITO/Au) were also fabricated. The PCE of carbon-based  flexible PSCs had almost no decrease even after bending  with   $4~\\mathrm{mm}$   curvature and then slightly decreased to   $85\\%$   of  the original\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
