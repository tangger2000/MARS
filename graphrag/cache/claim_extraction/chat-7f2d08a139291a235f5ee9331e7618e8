Another two benzoates were selected as the potential passivators for CsPb(Cl/Br)3 perovskite, namely benzoic acid lithium (BAL) and benzoic acid sodium (BAS) containing Li+ and Na+, respectively. First of all, we carried out the same research about the influence of BAL and BAS on the properties of perovskite films. Although there are few pinholes in the BAL- and BASmodified perovskite films, they still show much improved morphology with compact crystal grains in comparison with the pristine one (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Besides, the BAL- and BAS-modified perovakite films exhibit apparently reduced surface roughness in comparison with the pristine one (Figure S3, Supporting Information). To check the interaction between perovskite and these two benzoates, XPS measurements were performed the collect the spectra from the core level orbitals of Pb 4f, Cl 2p, and Br 3d by the same way as described above (Figures S12 and S13, Supporting Information). All the spectra exhibit almost the same shift as the condition of BAP-modified sample, indicating that the three benzoates share the similar regulating effect for perovskite film. The PL peaks and absorption spectra of BAL- and BAS-modified perovskite films undergo nearly no change with those of pristine one (Figures S14 and S15, Supporting Information), while the PL intensity of BAL-modified perovskite film is slightly higher than that of BAS-modified one. The Tauc plot analysis depicted by the inset of Figure S15 (Supporting Information) shows the negligible change in the optical bandgap of the BAL- and BAS-modified perovskite films as compared with that of BAPmodified sample. The TRPL curves of BAL- and BAS-modified perovskite films and their corresponding fitting data signify the improved photo physical performance of perovskite films (Figure S16; Table S1, Supporting Information). In order to explore the effect of BAL- and BAS-modification on devices, sky-blue PeLEDs with these two additives were manufactured with the same structure as depicted in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). As plotted in Figure 4 a,b, the BAL- and BASmodified PeLEDs show superior performance over the pristine device. The EQE statistics of the two PeLEDs demonstrate the reproducibility of the efficiency enhancement, of which the average values reach 9.78% and 8.47%, respectively (Figure S17, Supporting Information). Both devices display stable EL spectra under various driven voltages, which can be attributed to the suppressed halide ion migration. What’s more, the BAL- and BAS-modification can also enhance the operational stability of PeLEDs to a certain extent as displayed in Figures S10 and S11 (Supporting Information). However, BAL- and BAS-modified PeLEDs lag behind the BAP-modified device both in EL efficiency and operational stability. Considering that all the three additives have the same 8A- group, we believe the variation in device performance originates from the different alkali metal ions. The doped alkali metal ions have been proved to combine with negative charged halide ions through strong ionic bond. The strength of such Coulombic interaction obeys the trend of Li+>Na+>K+ due to their ionic radius difference. Hence, all the three alkali metal ions can induce enough energy barrier for the formation of halide vacancies and ion migration. Based on the above analysis, we speculate that the spatial distribution of alkali metal ions within the perovskite films plays a dominant role in manipulating the device performance. According to the first principle DFT calculations, it has been revealed that Li+ and Na+ are prone to accumulate at perovskite surface while K+ tends to exist within the bulk. Inspired by this finding, we conducted depth-dependent XPS measurements for Pb, K, and Na elements by varying the photoelectron detection angles as previously reported. The XPS measurement at higher detection angle is more sensitive to surface while the opposite condition is more sensitive to bulk. It should be noted that Li+ was not tested on account of its much lower detection precision. The XPS spectral intensity decreases with increasing detection angles due to the nonuniform spatial distribution of emitted photoelectron (Figure 4d,e,g,h). By integrating the spectral area with respective to the baseline, we can compare the elemental content change. The relative content ratios of Na and K to Pb are depicted in Figure  4f,i, where all the ratios are normalized with respect to the values obtained at the detection angle of 0. In the BAS-modified perovskite film, the Na/ Pb content ratio rises sharply with increasing detection angle (Figure 4f), indicating that the Na+ preferentially accumulates at the film surface. Under the same condition, however, the K/Pb experiences slow decline (Figure 4i), which demonstrates relatively more homogenous distribution of K+ inside perovskite grains. Accordingly, Na+ and Li+ are more inclined to bind with halide ions near the surface of perovskite film, while K+ can anchor the halide ions throughout the bulk (Figure S18, Supporting Information). Particularly, implementing effective modification for the bottom perovskite surface is also of great importance for improving device performance owing to the high tendency to generate defects just as the top surface. Therefore, the additive BAP has the best capability of minimizing the crystal defects during the perovskite crystallization among)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1.
