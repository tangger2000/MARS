Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Moreover, interaction between \n\n  $\\mathrm{{P}{.}\\mathrm{{PDA}}^{2+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{6}^{-}$   was further extracted from FTIR spectra \n\n ( Figure    2 b). For   $\\mathrm{{P}{\\mathrm{cdot}}\\mathrm{{PDAP}}\\mathrm{{bBr}}_{4}}$   powder, the   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   scissoring  vibration peak became weakened and shifted to lower wavenumber revealing subdued bending. Meanwhile, the broadened profile of   $_{\\mathrm{C-H}}$   and   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   stretching vibration peaks also  ensure the altered molecule state in 2D perovskite compared to  that of   $\\mathrm{P{\\mathrm{-}P D A B r}}_{2}$   powder.  It should be noted that hydrogen  bond is widely accepted between amino terminal and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{6}^{-}$  . In order to have a quant if i cation al analysis in   $\\mathrm{P{-}P D A B r_{2}}$  constructed 2D perovskite, we conducted solid   $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$   nuclear magnetic resonance   $(^{1}\\mathrm{{H}\\ N M R)}$   measurements (Figure  1c) where  all ionized hydrogen located at ammonium ion in P-PDA  $\\mathrm{{PbBr}_{4}}$  case (Identified from Figure  S1, Supporting Information)  shifted to low-field (from 8.12  to   $8.25\\,\\mathrm{\\pmm})$   indicative of a  decreased shield factor. Above result directly ensures the symmetrical double side hydrogen bonding between   $\\mathrm{{P}{.}\\mathrm{{PDA}}^{2+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{6}^{-}$  . Figure 1d shows a schematic representation of quasi- 2D perovskite   $(n=2)$  ). For   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{7}$  , the corresponding PL  spectra suffered from inferior stability as shown in Figure S2  (Supporting Information). It can be postulate that weak interaction between spacer and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{6}^{-}$  causes vulnerable lowdimensional components. Rationally,   $\\mathrm{PDACs}_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}\\mathrm{Br}_{3n+1}$  with stronger bonding force between spacer and inorganic  layers is expected to have better domain stability.  Density  functional theory (DFT) simulations were thus carried out to  verify this scenario (Figure S3 and Table S1, Supporting Information). Results confirmed that   $\\mathrm{P{\\mathrm{-}P D A B r}_{2}}$   based perovskite  with either pure   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   or   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domains possess much larger formation energies than that of the PEABr-based ones.  \n\nTo further investigate optical features of   $\\mathrm{P{-}P D A B r_{2}}$   constructed perovskite films, various precursor were employed.  The detailed recipe can be found in Note S1 (Supporting  Information). Briefly, mole ratio of   $\\mathrm{P{\\mathrm{-}P D A B r}}_{2}$  : CsBr:   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$   were  tuned from 2:1:2 to 2:4:5 and marked as P1 to P5 (Supporting  Information). The film formation characteristics including  scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) images are collected in Figure  S4 (Supporting  Information). As seen in Figure  2a, all samples presented  excitonic absorption which can be assigned to low-dimensional  domains from   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   to   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   with peaks at   $394\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ,   $425\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , and   $455~\\mathrm{~nm}$  , respectively. Excitonic absorption signals from   $\\mathrm{n}_{4}$    and higher n domains were enveloped by quasi continuous  absorption. As decreasing   $\\mathrm{P{\\mathrm{-}P D A B r}_{2}}$   ratio, domain distribution of resulted films presented stepwise monotonous change  as demonstrated in corresponding absorption and PL spectra  (Figure 2b). Remarkably, P1 and P2 samples showed desirable  deep-blue emission mainly from  $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain with peaks at about   $465~\\mathrm{nm}$  . The corresponding PLQY increased from  $3\\%$   to   $24\\%$  ,  as shown in Figure 2c. Although P3 film exhibited the highest  PLQY of   $28\\%$  , its PL peak was shifted to  $477\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  . Therefore, P2  with desired emission in the deep-blue region and ­ relatively  high PLQY was selected as candidate sample for our  subsequent study with the aim of achieving efficient deep-blue  perovskite LEDs.  \n\nTo verify domain stability of   $\\mathrm{P{\\mathrm{-}P D A B r}_{2}}$   based 2D perovskite,  aging test under elevated temperature   $(100\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   with an exposure of moisture   $(40\\%)$   or UV excitation   $(365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}\\,\\,5\\,\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  )  were carried out on P2 case. Film structure evolution before  and after aging was monitored by using GIXRD (Figure  S5,  Supporting Information).
