Then, a com- mercial   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   colloid dispersion was employed to prepared highquality ETLs. Incorporating with a   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   pass iv ation strategy, a  certified PCE of  $20.9\\%$   was obtained.  Further enhancing the  electron mobility of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layer by introducing ethylene  diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and red-carbon quantum dots  (RCQs) significantly improved the device efficiency to   $21.52\\%$    and   $22.77\\%$  ,  and the most efficient   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -based planar  PSCs have achieved a certified PCE of   $23.3\\%$   by conducting  surface pass iv ation of the perovskite layer.  Notably, as the  other bare inorganic nanoparticles, the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   nanoparticles are  colloid ally unstable due to attractive inter particle van der Waals  interactions, and tend to form large agglomerates. It is essential  to stabilize the  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   nanoparticles in the dispersion for depositing high quality ETLs. Besides the electronic properties of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layer, the interface between the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL and the perovskite layer also plays an essential role for obtaining high efficiency and stability. It has been reported that plenty of defects  may form at the ETL/perovskite interface during the low-temperature synthesis procedure.  Whether the ultrathin   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layer   $(20{-}30\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   is able to completely cover the indium  tin oxide (ITO) surface and assure perfect electronic contact  with the perovskite layer is still under debate. Compared with  mesoporous ETL, whether the planar ETL can enable an equivalent contact with the per ovsk ites, and correspondingly deliver  equivalent device performance is also uncertain. For further  enhancing the performance of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -based planar PSCs, more  effort should to be devoted to tuning and shedding light on the  interface of ETL/perovskite.  \n\nHere, we report employing a biological polymer of heparin  potassium (HP) to regulate the arrangement of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nanocrystals. Heparin is a linear sulfated polysaccharide containing   ${\\approx}2.7$   sulfate groups per disaccharide,  which can coordinate with lead atoms of the per ovsk ites.  The high negative charge density of HP makes it efficient for stabilizing the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   nano crystals in the dispersion.  The functional groups  on HP can bridge the per ovsk ites to the well-arranged   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$    nano crystals, and induce a vertically aligned crystal growth of  mixed-cation perovskite of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.05}\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.10}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{0.97}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.03})_{3}$    (  $\\mathrm{FA}=$  form amid in i um;   $\\mathrm{MA}=$  methyl ammonium). The devices  based on   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}–H P}$   delivered an average efficiency of over   $23\\%$    on rigid substrates with high reproducibility, and achieved an  efficiency of   $19.47\\%$   on flexible substrates. It is proposed that  the improved lattice matching between the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layer and  the perovskite layer enables enhanced interface contact, and  contributes to the aligned distributions of perovskite domains.  High operational stability was also obtained by   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}–H P}$  -based  planar PSCs, for which   $97\\%$   of the initial performance was  retained after   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$   operation at their maximum power point  (MPP) under continuous 1 sun illumination.  \n\nAs shown in  Figure    1 a, we have designed a biological  polymer of HP to stabilize the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   colloid dispersion and  regulate the arrangement of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   nano crystals. Then, a vertically aligned crystal growth of the perovskite layer is induced on  the well-arranged   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL. HP is based on disaccharide units  with functional groups of   $\\mathrm{-COO^{-}/-S O_{3}}^{-}$   and potassium ions \n\n  $\\left(\\mathrm{K^{+}}\\right)$  . It is anticipated that HP is able to adsorb on the surface of \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano crystals due to interactions between the   $\\mathrm{Sn}$   atoms of \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and O atoms of   $-C O O^{-}$  . The polymer chain of HP may  weaken the interactions between neighboring   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nanocrystals, and thus facilitate a homogeneous dispersion of the  nano crystals.  We diluted the commercial   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   colloid dispersion (  $15\\%$   in water) with deionized water and obtained a clear  dispersion with a concentration of  ${\\approx}2.67\\%$  . The zeta potential of  the fresh   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   dispersion was measured to be   $-20.4\\:\\mathrm{mV},$   indicating incipient instability. After storage of  $\\cdot72\\,\\mathrm{h}$   at ambient temperature   $(20{-}25\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   as suggested by the supplier, the dispersion  became cloudy and opaque (Figure 1b), and the zeta potential  decreased to  .5 mV. This revealed the electrostatic potential  was insufficient to repel the nano crystals from each other, and  unfavorable aggregations have occurred.  This issue is quite  common for dispersions based on metal oxide particles, which  is caused by inter particle van der Waals interactions.  When  HP   $(6~\\mathrm{mg}~\\mathrm{mL}^{-1})$   was added into the dispersion, the zeta potential significantly increased to   $32.3\\,\\,\\mathrm{mV},$   and no visible change  was observed after ageing. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)  measurements were conducted to characterize the variations of  the particle size. For the pristine   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   dispersion, the particle  size increased from 16.8 to 167 .9 nm   $(86.5\\%)$   after ageing, while  the particle size kept unchanged for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}–H P}$   dispersion  (Table S1, Supporting Information). Notably, the particle size of  the   $\\mathrm{subseteqO_{2}–H P}$   dispersion   $(23.7\\:\\mathrm{nm})$   is slightly larger than that of  fresh   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   dispersion, and this is proposed to be caused by the  adsorption of HP on surface of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano crystals, which will  be confirmed and discussed in the next section.  \n\nBesides stabilizing the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   dispersions, HP can also work  as a template to regulate the arrangement of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   nanocrystals on ITO substrates. As shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1c),   $\\mathrm{subseteqO_{2}–H P}$   showed  much more exposed (101) facets than   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . After spin-coating  and annealing, the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}–H P}$   thin film showed much larger  domain size   $(40{-}50\\;\\mathrm{nm})$   than pristine  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   thin film   $(\\approx\\!20\\:\\mathrm{nm})$  ,  as confirmed by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images  (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Since the   $\\mathrm{subseteqO_{2}–H P}$   film  was processed at a temperature of   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , no crystal growth or  grain mergence will occur. The enlarged domain size is considered as the result of ordered distribution of  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano crystals in  a specific area. Notably, the increased domain size also resulted  in\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
