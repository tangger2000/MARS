The existence of abundance defects and numerous interfaces between the rock salt and spinel phases, were proved through XRD, XPS, EPR, SEM, and HRTEM characterizations, which resulted in significant polarization. The EM wave permeability spectra and magnetic loss tangents (tan $\\delta_{\\upmu,}$ ) of rock salt/spinel HE oxides are presented in Figure S29d–f (Supporting Information).

The   $\\mu^{\\prime\\prime}$   values of HE-Fe-1300 were  higher than those of the other three HE oxides, which can be  attributed to the high spinel content. As shown in Figure S29f  (Supporting Information), the tan   $\\delta_{\\upmu}$   values for all HE oxides  exhibited similar variation trends and were greater than 0.15  in the entire frequency range, which indicates a high magnetic loss, originating from the eddy current effect and natural resonance.  Another key factor for the HE-Fe-1200 to  exhibit excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance  is impedance matching   $(Z_{\\mathrm{in}}/Z_{0})$  , which must be considered  when designing new and better microwave absorbers.  $[29\\mathrm{a},47]$   A   $Z_{i n}/Z_{0}$   value closer to 1.0 indicates a better impedance match.   The non-oscillation of the real part   $(\\mu^{\\prime})$   ensures the notion of  modifying the dielectric constant to achieve optimal impedance matching.

Therefore, strong dissipation and superior  impedance balance are required for high-efficiency EM wave  absorption materials.  \n\n# 2.4. EM Absorption Mechanism in Hybrid HE Oxides  \n\nConsidering the remarkable microwave absorption properties  of hybrid HE oxides,  Figure   4  depicts the absorption mechanism of their EM waves. Conduction loss and polarization  relaxation are the two most important variables affecting the  dielectric loss.  Unlike carrier-rich materials such as metals  and graphene, where charge accumulation is observed in HE  ceramic oxides owning to limited conductivity, polarization  relaxation dominates the dielectric losses. Due to crystal defects  and lattice distortions, HE ceramic oxides generated numerous  dipoles. Influenced by the EM field, these dipoles will be reorganized from random to the electric field direction, causing  energy loss.  Point defects, as a part of lattice defects, primarily consist of interstitial atoms and vacancies. Using oxygen  vacancies as an example, the introduction of anionic vacancies can increase the charge density at the top of the valence  band of a semiconductor.  Thus, it can be speculated that the  abundance of localized electrons in metal atoms lead to more  dipole polarization owning to the presence of oxygen vacancies.  In addition to point defects, HE ceramic oxides contain dislocations and stacking faults, thus the formed grain boundaries  (Figure  4b) function as a sink for defects and impurities,   which favorably impact dipole polarization. In addition, a key  benefit of complex-phase absorbers is that the inter facial polarization resulting from charge accumulation could absorb EM  waves. In the rock salt/spinel system depicted in Figure 4a, for  instance, the contact potential drives the directional movement  of electrons  because the work function of the spinel phase  is less than that of the rock salt phase, whereas the radiated  reverse electric field counteracts the carrier motion and ultimately creates a capacitor-like electronic structure.  Benefiting  from the periodicity of EM waves, energy is dissipated during  inter facial polarization relaxation.  \n\nIn rock salt/spinel HE oxides, magnetic loss, which consists  of eddy current loss and natural resonance, is also a significant  component for EM wave absorption. Eddy current losses originate from the excitation of induced eddy currents in magnetic  materials in response to alternating EM fields. In a ferromagnetic rock salt/spinel system, eddy current losses are generally  beneficial for EM wave absorption due to the poor electrical  conductivity of magnetic oxide.  In contrast to eddy current  loss, which often occurs over   $10\\:\\mathrm{\\GHz}$  , natural resonance is  frequently observed in lower frequency ranges. When the EM  field is close to the frequency of magnetic moment precession,  the system absorbs energy and consumes it through damping,  turning it into heat.  Rock salt/spinel HE oxides exhibit several resonance peaks in the tested frequency band (Figure S30e,  Supporting Information). In summary, the eddy current loss  and natural resonance contribute to the magnetic loss in HE  ceramic oxides.  \n\n# 2.5. Density Function Calculation of Hybrid HE Oxides  \n\nThe electrical properties were simulated through first-principles  calculations to better highlight the differences in the content of  dual-phase ceramic oxides and oxygen vacancy concentration.  As the spinel content increased, the band structure of perovskite/spinel HE oxides became evident, as shown in Figure  S32a (Supporting Information),  Figure   5 a, and Figure S32b   (Supporting Information). All samples demonstrated forbidden  band widths, which were less than the narrow band gap criterion   $(0.26~\\mathrm{eV})$  ), and their energy bands significantly overlapped  with the Fermi energy level   $(0\\ \\mathrm{eV})$  . This phenomenon, combined with the observation that the density of states (DOS)  curves in Figure 5b pass the Fermi energy level, illustrating that  the rock salt-spinel system is metallic. Notably, “metal li city”  does not imply that HE oxides possess the properties of metals;  they are still essentially semiconductors.  Figure 5c shows the  charge density difference (CDD) plots for various spinel phase  contents, which revealed that a significant amount of charge  escaped from HE metal atoms and gathered around the oxygen  atoms. Moreover, due to the presence of a contact potential that  impelled electrons toward the spinel, the ability of the perovskite phase to acquire electrons also declined as the spinel  phase increased. Additional oxygen vacancies were added to the  aforementioned system to imitate the electrical characteristics  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/dd810b96bcf23b50b3aaffc37c002cd19f8aceb788d31554fcbd093c7a57a084-1727105001.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   EM absorption mechanism of hybrid HE oxides. a) Schematic of structural defects consisting of point defect, lattice distortion, heterointerface, and grain boundary in spinel/perovskite HE oxides, accounting for EM absorption. b) Schematic of structural defects, including point defect,  lattice distortion, he t ero interface, and natural resonance in rock salt/spinel HE oxides, contributing to EM dissipation.  \n\nat the interface.
