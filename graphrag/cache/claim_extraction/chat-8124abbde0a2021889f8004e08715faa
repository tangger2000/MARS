Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The crystallographic sites of these trivalent ions can be readily replaced by  RE ions.  In previous works, the introduction of RE ions is  able to promote the tuning of the emission upon X-ray excitation. The appropriate doping concentration of RE ions will  not induce the complete scintillation quenching under X-ray  excitation.  In addition, there are also some reports on  Bi-based materials that show the absorption of X-ray, which  are also typical lead-free perovskite materials.  Bi ions are  reported to improve the crystal perfection as well as the exciton  localization for enhanced PLQY.  \n\nHerein, a lead-free   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}/B i^{3+}}$   co-doped double perov- skite single crystal is developed, which features excellent  multimodal and multicolor luminescence. Under the X-ray  excitation, ultraviolet light, and NIR laser   $(980~\\mathrm{nm})$   irradiation,  the warm yellow light, bright warm white light, and green light  are observed, respectively. Most importantly, the further experimental results also confirm the high stability against humidity,  high temperature, and high dose radiation of the as-synthesized material, opening the opportunities for flexible applications in X-ray detection and anti-counterfeiting as well as other  daily applications.  \n\nThree  RE-doped  samples   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{Ag}_{0.6}\\mathrm{Na}_{0.4}\\mathrm{lnCl}_{6}\\mathrm{:Yb}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}/$   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   (RE-1),   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{Ag}_{0.6}\\mathrm{Na}_{0.4}\\mathrm{lnCl}_{6};\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  (RE-2),   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  : \n\n  $\\mathrm{{Yb}^{3+}/E r}^{3+}$   (RE-3) (top of  Figure   1 a), and one RE-free sample \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   (RE-4) were synthesized by a reported method  with minor modifications.  Single-crystal X-ray diffraction  analysis results revealed that RE-1 ( CSD No . 1941823), RE-2  ( CSD No . 1976878), and RE-3 ( CSD No . 1976879) belong to the  cubic space group   $F m\\overline{{3}}m$   (225) and contains 8Cs,   $4\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{g/Na}$  ,  4In,  and 24Cl (bottom of Figure 1a).   $\\mathrm{{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$  , and   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$  ions  have similar ionic radii and valence states, and they occupy the  same crystallographic site in the perovskite structure. These  trivalent ions are surrounded by six   $C\\mathrm{l^{-}}$   ions in an octahedral  configuration.   $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   occupy the same site, which is also  coordinated with six   $C\\mathrm{l^{-}}$   ions, forming octahedral coordination  geometry. The   $\\mathrm{In}^{3+}/\\mathrm{RE}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}/N a^{+}}$   based octahedron s  are uniformly distributed in the perovskite structure, and   $C s^{+}$  is distributed between the sides of the two neighboring octahedrons. The deviation of the different unit cell parameters  among the structures of RE-1, RE-2, and RE-3 is less than   $1\\%$  (Table S1, Supporting Information), which are almost identical  with the structures of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{NalnCl}_{6}$  , supporting  the absence of secondary phases (Table S2, Supporting Information).  Moreover, previous works have systematically  investigated the doping concentration of Na and Bi ions in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  , which indicates no obvious defects is formed at  the doping concentration as RE-1.  Therefore, we confirm  that all four compounds belong to the same crystal structures,  in which RE-1, RE-2, and RE-3 maintained the pristine perfect  structure of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  .  \n\nAll of the compounds were characterized by the powder XRD  (Figure  1b), and the results are in good agreement with the  simulated diffraction pattern from the single-crystal structure  of RE-1 (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

The insets in (e) and (f) show the coordination  environments of Cs and In atoms.  \n\npeaks of the RE-doped samples shift to lower angles compared  with the undoped one; according to Bragg’s law, the doping of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}/B i^{3+}}$   or   $\\mathrm{{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}}}$   ions lead to a slight expansion of  the perovskite crystal cells (Figure  1c).  One of the reasons  is that the RE ions have larger radii than indium ion. In addition, the different coordination affinity between   $\\mathrm{{Yb}^{3+}/E r}^{3+}$   and   $C\\mathrm{l^{-}}$   ions in perovskite structure also leads to the slight lattice  distortion.  The XRD patterns of RE-1, RE-2, and RE-3 show  similar changes. These results also confirmed that   $\\mathrm{{Yb}^{3+}/E r}^{3+}$  ions have been successfully doped into the lattice of perovskite  materials.  \n\n$^{133}\\mathrm{Cs}$    and   ${}^{115}\\mathrm{In}$    magic-angle-spinning  (MAS)  solid- state NMR (SSNMR) spectra of RE-1 and control sample   $(\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{Ag}_{0.6}\\mathrm{Na}_{0.4}\\mathrm{lnCl}_{6}\\mathrm{:Bi}$  ) were recorded at  $9.4\\,\\mathrm{T}$   to further analysis  its fine structure. The doping of para magnetic   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  ions induces a shift of the  $^{133}\\mathrm{Cs}$   peak from 103.3 to 101.1 ppm as  well as a significant broadening of this signal (the full-width-athalf-height increases from 173 to   $300~\\mathrm{Hz}$  ) (Figure 1d).  The  shift of peak position is due to the delocalization of extra electron density of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   (spin  $I=1/2$   and   $3/\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
