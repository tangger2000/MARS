Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In the case  reported by Qiu et al., similar observations were made.  The  SAED pattern in the inset of Figure 4f shows that the R-HEO  undergoes crystal lin it y deterioration upon cycling, but small  crystalline domains can still be identified after 300 cycles.  \n\nThe formation of secondary phases (metal or metal oxides) was  not observed in both studies. The presence of a “stable” host  lattice (probably inactive MgO) and sluggish diffusion effects  were assumed by Qiu et al. to be the reasons for the structural  integrity and the stable cycling performance.  Hence, both  studies independently point toward a very similar reaction  mechanism, where some of the constituent elements preserve  the host lattice structure, while the others react to contribute  to the capacity. Combining both mechanistic hypotheses,  it  seems that the retention of R-HEO structure is possibly due to  sluggish diffusion, preventing element segregation and formation of individual (binary) oxides.  \n\n# 4. Summary and Outlook  \n\nIn recent years, HEOs have evolved into a new research field.  The possibility of incorporating multiple cations (five or  more) into a specific lattice structure opens up new ways for  designing/tailoring oxide materials. The uniform distribution  of cations in HEOs, among others, strengthens the hypothesis of entropy-dominated phase-stabilization effects in these  chemically complex systems. Furthermore, the unique chemistry of HEOs leads to materials with exciting and unexpected  properties. The multi functional behavior of HEO is clearly  evident from the fact that there are several different properties reported (dielectric, magnetic, thermal, catalytic, etc.) for  a single composition of   $(\\mathrm{Co}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Cu}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Mg}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Zn}_{0.2})\\mathrm{O}$  . The high  Li-ion conduct iv i ties along with promising Li-storage capabilities make the rock-salt-based HEOs (R-HEOs) interesting for  battery applications. It has been found that the entropy stabilization not only affects the phase stability, but also the functional  properties (e.g., R-HEOs exhibit much more stable and reversible de/lithiation behavior than medium entropy oxides). The  combination of high Li-ion conduct iv i ties in Li-doped R-HEO  with high specific capacities observed when R-HEOs are used  as an electrode (anode) material indicates the possibility of fabricating all HEO-based solid-state batteries (depending upon  the possibility of designing a suitable HEO-type cathode material). Overall, the HEO concept could possibly pave the way to  develop advanced oxide materials, which make use of the   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$    structure stabilization effect to advance in the areas of thermo/ mechanical engineering and semi-/superconductors, to name a  few. A combination of experiments and theoretical calculations  is essential for this new class of oxide systems to find the right  composition regime for achieving targeted functional properties.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors acknowledge financial support from the Helmholtz  Association and the Deutsche For s chung s gemeinschaft (HA 1344/43-1).
