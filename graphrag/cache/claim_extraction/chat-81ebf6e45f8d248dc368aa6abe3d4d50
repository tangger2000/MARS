Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.

TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layer and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF layer were obtained consequently. Then we spin-coated different concentrations of RbF  aqueous solution on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layers to fabricate the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/}$  RbF layers. To confirm the existence of RbF on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   surface, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were operated on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RbF, and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   films ( Figure   1 a).

However, the   $\\mathrm{Sn\\3d}$   peak of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   shows almost no shift  compared with the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film, which implies the weak interaction between  $\\mathrm{F}$   and Sn atoms. This phenomenon indicates that  the   $_{\\mathrm{F-Sn}}$   bond may form before or during the annealing process, after that   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   has crystalized and could hardly interact  with F ions.  \n\nTo explore the surface morphology and roughness of the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   films without/with RbF treatment, atomic force micro­ scopy (AFM) was operated.

The optical transmission spectra of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  without/with RbF treatment are shown in Figure 1c. The optical  transmission of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RbF is a little higher than the others in  the short wavelength, which is favorable for fabricating solar  cells. In addition, all these films show high transmittance in the  visible region, indicating excellent optical property. Ultraviolet  photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out to explore the  energy band structure of  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   films with or without RbF modification. The corresponding calculation methods and results are  shown in Figures S4–S7 and Table S1, Supporting Information,  respectively. Figure  S8, Supporting Information, shows the  energy band alignment of different ETLs, obviously the appearance of RbF has little effect on the energy level of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  .  \n\nThe electron mobility of various ETLs measured by a space  charge-limited current (SCLC) with the device structure of  ITO/Al/ETL/Al is shown in Figure  S9, Supporting Information.

It can be found that the  electron mobility of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$     $(3.65\\,\\times\\,10^{-4}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\,\\mathrm{S}^{-1})$   is lower  than that of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -RbF   $(5.69\\times10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{S}^{-1})$  , but similar  to   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$     $(3.63\\times10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{S}^{-1})$  . Moreover, the devices  composed of ITO/ETLs/Au were prepared to investigate the  conductivity of the ETLs. Figure 1d displays the current–voltage  ( I – V ) characteristic curves and the inset shows the device structure. We calculated the conductivity   $(\\sigma)$   using the following  equation:  \n\n$$\n\\sigma={\\frac{I d}{V A}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $A$   is the area and   $d$   is the thickness of the samples. The  corresponding calculated parameters are shown in Table  S3,  Supporting Information. The conductivity of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF is estimated to be   $4.26\\,\\times\\,10^{-3}\\,\\,\\mathrm{mS\\,\\,cm}^{-1}$  , higher than that of   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/}$  RbF   $(3.17\\times10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{mS\\;cm}^{-1})$  ) and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (  $(3.01\\times10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{mS\\;cm}^{-1})$  ). The  enhanced electron mobility and conductivity demonstrate the  more effective charge transport of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -RbF, which effectively  inhibits charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface  and improves\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
