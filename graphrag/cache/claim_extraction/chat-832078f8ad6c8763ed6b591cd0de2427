Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

F6TCNNQ is a strong electron-acceptor  molecule and low LUMO energy level   $(\\approx\\!5.37\\ \\mathrm{eV})$  ) of the molecular dopant  matches well with the VBM   $(\\approx\\!5.2~\\mathrm{eV})$   of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  .  Combining theoretical calculation and experimental characterization results, F6TCNNQ was discovered as an effective  p-type molecular dopant to increase both VBM and Fermi level  of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs, as well as upgrading the conductivity of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  film by increasing hole concentration inside. This results in the  reduction of energy level offset between   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   and per ovsk ites,  which remarkably enhances holes extraction efficiency and  reduces the contact resistance at the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  –perovskite interface.  Based on that understanding, F6TCNNQ-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   boosts  the inverted planar   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  -based best devices performance  to nearly   $20\\%$   in PCE, as compared to the controlled one with  the bare   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   $(18.19\\%)$  . Strikingly, using   $C s^{+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{H}C(\\mathrm{NH})_{2}{}^{+}$   and   ${\\mathrm{CH}}_{3}{\\mathrm{NH}}_{3}{}^{+}$   (CsFAMA) mixed cations per ovsk ites with broader  photon absorption, the best devices performance was enhanced  from 19.6 to   $20.86\\%$  , which is comparable to latest reported  efficiencies of the inverted planar PSCs.  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs were deposited on cleaned ITO glass with   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   nano particle inks at room temperature according to previously reported procedure.  Obtained  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   thin films were  uniform and pinhole free.  Chemical structure of molecular dopant F6TCNNQ is shown at  Figure   1 a. It is composed  of six fluorine substitutes on naphthalene core and four cyano  functional groups, hence it can be easily ionized by attracting  electrons.  The reason that we select this dopant is  its high EA and significant low lowest unoccupied molecular  orbital (LUMO)  energy level   $(\\approx\\!5.37\\ \\mathrm{eV})$  ),  which is   ${\\approx}0.16\\ \\mathrm{eV}$  lower compared to the VBM of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  (5.21 eV) (Figure 1a). The  molecular doping was simply achieved by loading and spin  coating the acetonitrile (ACN) solution of F6TCNNQ onto asprepared   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   thin films, followed by annealing at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   overnight (see more details in ESI). Based on the anticipated effect of  molecular doping of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  HTLs by F6TCNNQ, planar-inverted   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$   PSCs with and without the molecular doping of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  HTLs were investigated. Device structure is depicted in Figure  S1a in the Supporting Information. Perovskite active layers were  deposited with previously reported one-step anti solvent method  (see more details in ESI).    $\\mathrm{PC}_{61}\\mathrm{BM}$   and ZrAcac are selected  as electron transport layer (ETL) and cathode inter facial layer  (CIL).  The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the PSCs with  pristine and p-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs were shown in Figure S1 in  the Supporting Information, and summarized in Table S1 in the  Supporting Information. The best device efficiency of the PSCs  with the p-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  achieved a PCE of   $19.75\\%$   with open  circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   of   $1.12~\\mathrm{V},$   short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\right)$  of   $22.05\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$  , and fill factor (FF) of   $80.0\\%$  . All the three  device parameters are obviously augmented in contrast to the  best control device with a PCE of   $18.19\\%$  . Both control and  p-doped devices exhibit negligible hysteresis effect, which shows  high device quality and is consistent with observations in previous reports (Figure S1c,d, Supporting Information).  The  optimal device performance is obtained with modification of an  F6TCNNQ solution of   $10\\times10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{mg\\mL^{-1}}$  , which will be used  for following discussions (Figure S1b, Supporting Information).  \n\nTo figure out the mechanism behind the improvement, electronic structures of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   with and without F6TCNNQ doping  were probed with ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS),  which is widely used to study the density of states below the  Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$   of a material and its surface.  As  shown in Figure 1b,c, the valance band spectra show that the  energetic gap between   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   and VBM of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   becomes narrow  from 0.58 to   $0.29~\\mathrm{eV}$   after F6TCNNQ doping and also indicates  that its hole concentration increases too. From the UPS measurement, we can directly determine the work functions (WF)   $\\phi$  of the pristine and molecule-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  thin films, which  are  $-4.63$   to   $-5.07\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   respectively (Figure 1c). The VBM levels  of the pristine and doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   were calculated to be   $-5.21$  and   $-5.36\\,\\mathrm{~eV},$   respectively. This indicates successful electron  transfer from NiO to F6TCNNQ, which is consistent to some  previous reports of F6TCNNQ and related compounds. All the values are approaching that of the per ovsk ites, which  definitely narrows the energy level offset for hole transfer  between   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   and the per ovsk ites and improves the device performance. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, the Ni 2p core level peak has an unambiguous shift  of   ${\\approx}0.17\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   after the doping of F6TCNNQ (Figure 1d), which  further convinces us of electron transfer occurred and agrees  with the phenomena of a shift of the Mo core level peak in molecule-doped 2D   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  .  No additional or new chemical components were detected by the XPS except the F and N signals  from the molecular dopant, indicating the successful doping  of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   films (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Based on  these data, the schematic band diagrams of the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  –perovskite  interface in the PSCs were illustrated in Figure 1e,f, where the  VBM and   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   per ovsk ites are set at   $5.4~\\mathrm{eV}$   and at  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/0d8c318c6733ad38b893ae951b182cd8f1a1ce181c20ea3f9d86f8cac30808b4-1727117699.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$   and molecular dopants of F6TCNNQ and the chemical structure; b) Valance band spectra of the   $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$   and F6TCNNQ-doped  $\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
