Apart  from the EM energy dissipation ability, impedance matching  characteristics also significantly affect the EM wave absorption  properties. The relative input impedance   $(|Z_{i n}/Z_{0}|)$   is always  used to evaluate impedance matching. The ideal   $|Z_{i n}/Z_{0}|$   value  is 1, signifying that EM waves can enter the absorber without  reflection on the air-absorber interface.  It can be observed  that the impedance matching area of   $0.8\\,\\leq\\,\\bigl|Z_{i n}/Z_{0}\\bigr|\\,\\leq\\,1.2$   for  HE-Cr-1300 is significantly larger than that of the other three  (Figure S16, Supporting Information). These results indicate  that HE-Cr-1300 exhibits the best impedance matching characteristic, which is consistent with its excellent EM wave absorption properties.  \n\n# 2.3. Characterization and EM Wave Absorption of Rock-Salt/Spinel  HE Oxides  \n\nXRD was performed on the HE oxides sintering at various  temperatures, as shown in Figure S17 (Supporting Information). The diffraction peaks can be attributed to the rock salt  and spinel-structured phases, indicating the formation of a  rock salt/spinel mixed structure. Rietveld refinements of XRD  patterns ( Figure   3 a; Figures S18–S20, Supporting Information) revealed a cubic (space group:   $\\mathrm{Fm}{\\cdot}3\\mathrm{m}$  ) symmetry and  spinel cubic (space group:  Fd-3m) symmetry for these HE  hybrid oxides. We further calculated the relative content of the  spinel phase in HE hybrid oxides based on the Rietveld refinement results. Note that the amount of spinel-structured phase  increased from   $22.4\\%$   to   $45.1\\%$   when the sintering temperature was increased from 1000 to   $1300~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  (Figure 3b; Table S3,  Supporting Information). It should be noted that biphasic HE  oxides tend to form rock salt phases with higher   $\\mathsf{S}_{\\mathrm{config}}$   at lower  sintering temperatures. The rock-salt structure is considered  as an EM wave transparent medium,  whereas the spinelstructured phase is considered a promising EM wave absorbing  constituent;  therefore, the ingenious regulation of phase  composition can result in better impedance matching to favor  the dissipation of EM waves.  \n\nFurther, XPS analyses were performed on the samples to  examine at their surface composition and chemical conditions.  The full spectra (Figure S21, Supporting Information) indicated  that Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and O co-existed in rock salt/spinel HE  oxides.

The  area of oxygen vacancy   $\\mathrm{(O_{D})}$   was calculated to be  ${\\approx}54\\%$   and  $48\\%$  of the total area of O 1s in HE-Fe-1200 and HE-Fe-1300, respectively (Table S4, Supporting Information), larger than those of  the other two rock salt/spinel HE oxides. This indicates the existence of numerous oxygen vacancies, which was also confirmed  by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra  (Figure S25,  Supporting Information). The defects can be considered as  polarization centers, contributing to EM dissipation.  Moreover, the   $\\mathrm{O_{L}}$   peaks of HE-Fe-1200 and HE-Fe-1300 exhibited a  considerable shift of   ${\\approx}0.25\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   toward higher binding energy,  indicating their electron donor role; this illustrates the strong  electron interactions formed between multiple metal cations  and oxygen anions. The Fe 2p curve in Figure S23 (Supporting Information) can be attributed to four spin-orbital  peaks and separate satellite peaks of   $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$  , respectively.  The binding energy of spin-orbital peaks located at 723.5 and   $709.8\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   are related to   $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$  , whereas the peaks centered at 724.9  and   $711.5~\\mathrm{eV}$   originated from   $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$   in HE-1200. This is significantly consistent with the existence of two valence states of Fe   $2p$   in the spinel-type phase.  Moreover, the   $\\mathrm{~Co~}\\,2p$   spectra  can be de convoluted into   $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}\\;2p_{1/2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}\\;2p_{3/2},$   as well as  two satellite peaks (Figure   $S24\\mathrm{a}$  , Supporting Information). Two  spin–orbit peaks at 873.1 and   $855.2~\\mathrm{eV}$   were observed in the  high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni   $2p$   (Figure   $S24\\mathsf{b}$  , Supporting  Information), associated with   $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}\\,2\\mathrm{p}_{1/2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}\\;2p_{3/2},$   respectively. Two satellite peaks centered at   ${\\approx}880.1$   (Ni   $2p_{1/2}$  ) eV and \n\n 861.5 (Ni   $2p_{3/2})$   eV were also observed. Analogously, the   ${\\mathrm{Cu~}}2p$  (Figure S24c, Supporting Information) and  $\\mathrm{Zn}\\;2p$   (Figure S24d,  Supporting Information) spectra can be fitted with one chemical valence.  \n\nThe morph o logie s of rock salt/spinel HE oxides, which  were examined through SEM and BEM images, are systematically shown in Figure S26 (Supporting Information) and  Figure 3c. Based on SEM images, all HE oxides exhibited the  combined characteristics of “polyhedron” and “sphere-like”  dual morph o logie s with uneven sizes. Based on BEM images,  the distinguishing contrast of the two morph o logie s verified the  coexistence of different compositions, which is in good accordance with the XRD results.
