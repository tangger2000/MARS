Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

We first found that   $^{*}\\mathrm{O}$   is stable but   $^{\\ast}\\mathrm{OO}$   is unstable. In other words, it is the AEM  that dominates the OER but not the lattice oxygen mechanism \n\n (LOM). Based on the AEM, the reaction of   $_\\mathrm{M-O^{\\ast_{+}}}$     $\\mathrm{OH^{-}\\ \\rightarrow}$   \n\n  $_{\\mathrm{M-OOH^{*}+e^{-}}}$   is take to be the rate determining step. In the  calculation, Mn was taken as the active site (Figure S15a,b, Supporting Information). The optimized structures having   $^{*}\\mathrm{O}$   and   $^{\\ast}\\mathrm{OOH}$   absorbed on the surface-active sites are shown in Figure  S15c, Supporting Information. The calculated over potentials as  a function of the free energy of the rate-determining step are  shown in Figure  5b. The OER activity estimated by the DFT  calculation is in a good agreement with the experimental data.  Both theory and experiment indicate that L5M2Co exhibits the  best OER activity. Moreover, as mentioned above, the controlling factor is the   $\\mathrm{Co}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$   ratio. This is also supported by the  DFT calculation, as shown in Figure 5b.  \n\nThe stability of the best L5M2Co catalyst was examined  using the chrono potenti o metric method under a constant  current density of   $10\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  . The sample shows excellent  electrochemical stability without apparent change after   $50\\,\\textrm{h}$    continuous electrolysis, as shown in  Figure   6 a. The polarization LSV curves (Figure 6b) were recorded initially and after   $50\\,\\textrm{h}$   of electrolysis. After   $50\\,\\textrm{h}$  , the activity is even slightly  higher than in the beginning, indicating the stable catalytic  performance. The stability of L5M2Co was further supported  by post-characterization of the used catalyst. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM were preformed after the  OER test. As shown in  Figure   7 , there is no noticeable change  in morphology of La5M2Co after OER process. The thin layer  forming and surrounding the particles may be the metal  hydroxides layer formed during the reaction.  The HRTEM  and SAED show a single phase crystalline perovskite structure  of the sample after OER, indicating the structural stability of  the HEPO. STEM-mapping shows the uniform distribution of  all elements.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/0c2c4e45b0ab11a43c45b6f5102f44fd533a7a0c1e2d5da2e9791456db8e11d8-1727102852.jpg)  \nFigure   6.   a) Durability test of L5M2n for   $50~\\mathsf{h}$  . b) Polarization curves before and after  $50~\\mathsf{h}$   stability test.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/a0dc9b2c7a930bf66106729d0cf078de101797ae1c76621dd7461bd014636a92-1727102918.jpg)  \nFigure   7.   a) SEM image, b) TEM image, c) HRTEM, d) SAED, and e) STEM-mapping of L5M2Co after OER test.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nA series of new single-phased high entropy perovskite nanoparticle oxides have been synthesized using a precipitation  method followed by post annealing. A total of five different  metals, including Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni are in the B-site lattices to make the per ovsk ites become high entropy materials.  Both equimolar and non-equimolar high entropy nanoparticles  were obtained and studied for their OER electro catalytic performances. We first show that the HEPOs outperform the single  perovskite oxides. The activity contribution of each metal in the  B-site lattices was then investigated by doubling its concentration. Doubling the Co was shown to be most effective, giving  an excellent over potential of   $325\\,\\mathrm{\\mV}$   at   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  , a low  Tafel slope of   $51.2~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1}$  , and excellent durability for   $50\\textrm{h}$  .  This study also opens a window of synthesizing advanced high  entropy materials for various potential applications.  \n\n# 4.
