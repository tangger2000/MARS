Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In  Figure   2 a, we present the loaded  dripping strategy to introduce the molecules into the perovskite film. Basically, during spin-coating of perovskite precursors in a solvent mixture of  γ -bu tyrol act one (GBL) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the molecules in chl oro benzene were  delivered in the anti solvent drip, followed by conversion via  thermal annealing.  Figure 2b illustrates the representative  time evolution of the scattering features during spin-coating  with respect to the scattering vector   $q$   and time for the   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$    perovskite ink without use of the drip. The results bear qualitative resemblance to the solidification of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   in DMF.   During the first 40–45 s, we observe the thinning and drying  of a wet, gel-like precursor as indicated by the formation of  a scattering halo at low   $q$   values   $(2{-}5~\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$  ) assigned to the  \n\ndisordered precursor colloidal gel,  as well as the liquid  solvent scattering at high   $q$   values (not shown). The features  of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals located at   $q\\ =\\ 9.0\\ \\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$   and intermediate   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}{\\cdot}D M S O}$   solvate located at  $q=4.4$  , 4.8, 6.3, and  $8.1\\;\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$  are observed after 40–45 s (see Figure S2 in the Supporting  Information for more information). The role of solvent drip  is to suppress over crystallization of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  ,  which is associated  with nonuniform film coverage and pinhole formation. In situ  GIWAXS measurements performed at  $80~\\mathrm{s}$   for the no drip, CB  (control) drip, PCBM, and ITIC drips in Figure 2c show differences in the shape and intensity of scattering patterns, with the  CB drip significantly reducing the intensity of the solvate peaks  compared to the no drip and loaded drip cases. We have plotted  the intensity versus   $q$   for the solvate,   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}.$  , and perovskite (110)  diffraction features in Figure 2d for the four cases. The comparison shows that the loaded drip indeed promotes the formation of   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}{\\cdot}D M S O}$   solvate in contrast to the blank CB  drip case. In addition, the pole figures in Figure 2e show that  the difference in intensity between the blank and loaded drip  is associated with formation of crystals with an out-of-plan texture, indicating the solvate phase exhibits preferential texture as  compared to the control sample.  \n\nWe summarize the formation mechanism of the perovskite  film in Figure 2f. During solution-casting, the introduced molecules promote nucleation and growth of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  ⋅ DMSO  solvate. These large crystalline MAPbI 3 ⋅ DMSO complexes  provide frameworks that act as a template for further growth  of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   when the solvent is released from the intermediate  solvate, allowing   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and the cations to form the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  perovskite phase. This molecule-aided crystallization leads to a  gap-filled film and better orientation of perovskite crystals, as  evidenced by much less full width at half maximum (FWHM)  values of diffraction peaks for the solvate and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   phase  (see more details in Table S1 in the Supporting Information).  For example, the FWHM of the diffraction peak of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  phase in film is 1.10, 0.68, and   $0.50\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}^{-1}$   for the control,  PCBM, and ITIC passivated samples, respectively.  \n\nWe further investigate the role of molecules on the microstructure of perovskite films and their op to electronic properties. The plan-view scanning electronic microscopy (SEM)  images illustrated in Figure S3a–e (Supporting Information)  highlight morphological differences at the surface of the passivated films in contrast to the control one. Molecular passivation yields smoother surfaces and fewer GBs ( Figure   3 a),  consistent with the observation of decreased heterogeneity as  presented from photo luminescence (PL) mapping (Figure S4,  Supporting Information). Removal of the molecules by solvent  washing results in thin films with similar GB appearance \n\n (Figure S5, Supporting Information) and device performance \n\n (Table S2, Supporting Information). These data clearly demonstrate that the molecules serve as efficient gap-fillers for polycrystalline perovskite films. The cross-sectional SEM analysis  on the passivated films further confirms better-connected  perovskite crystals with seamless GBs in contrast to the control one (Figure 3b; Figure S3f, Supporting Information).  Molecular distribution throughout the entire thickness of the  perovskite film was further determined. The cross-sectional  transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) was performed on the  representative glass  $\\mathrm{\\#/FTO/c\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!/T i O_{2}/|T I C\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\!\\!M A P b I_{3}/}$  carbon sample.  The elements of “Ti” from   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  , “Pb” and “I” from   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  ,  and   ${}^{u}S^{\\prime\\prime}$   from ITIC were tracked. We found   ${}^{u}S^{\\prime\\prime}$   is present uniformly throughout the entire thickness (Figure 3c), proving  that molecules indeed participate in uniform decoration at GBs  within perovskite films. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicates  quite similar crystal lin it y and texture of perovskite crystals  with and without molecules (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Similar observation was recently reported by Yang and  co-workers  Therefore, we conclude that the molecules have  little influence on the internal crystal structure and crystal lin it y  of grains but that these molecules are indeed decorating GBs  throughout the depth of the films.  \n\nHaving confirmed molecular decoration at GBs within the  bulk film, we seek to investigate the op to electronic properties  of perovskite films to gain insight into the pass iv ation mechanism with different molecular treatments. We confirm that the  absorption spectra of the control and passivated films are nearly  identical in all cases (Figure S7, Supporting Information), indicating negligible contribution to potential\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
