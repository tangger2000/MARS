intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Despite the rapid progress in performance that has been made for inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs recently, their PCEs  are still far below those of the hybrid  and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   PSCs.  The relatively low  open circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   and fill factor  (FF) are the main reasons for the poorer  performance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs. As for  perovskite PSCs, the energy loss   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{loss}}\\right)$    is defined as   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}=\\,E_{\\mathrm{g}}{\\cdot}e V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   (  $'E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   and e are  bandgap and elementary charge, respectively).  High   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   linked to high  defect density (large non radiative energy  loss) and mismatched bandgaps lead to  the decreased   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  . Therefore, high-quality  \n\nCesium-based inorganic per ovsk ites, such as  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r},$  , are promising  candidates for photovoltaic applications owing to their exceptional  op to electronic properties and outstanding thermal stability. However, the  power conversion efficiency of  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still  lower than those of hybrid PSCs and inorganic  $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{3}$   PSCs. In this work,  pass iv ation and n-type doping by adding  $\\mathsf{c a c l}_{2}$   to  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   is demonstrated.  The crystal lin it y of the  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   perovskite film is enhanced, and the trap  density is suppressed after adding  $\\mathsf{c a c l}_{2}$  . In addition, the Fermi level of the   $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   is changed by the added  $\\mathsf{c a c l}_{2}$   to show heavy n-type doping. As  a result, the optimized  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PSC shows a highest open circuit voltage  of  $\\mathbf{1.32\\,v}$   and a record efficiency of   $\\mathbf{16.79\\%}$  . Meanwhile, high air stability is  demonstrated for a  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PSC with  $\\mathbf{\\mathfrak{g o}}\\%$   of the initial efficiency remaining  after more than  $\\mathbf{\\rceil000\\,h}$   aging in air.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nperovskite films and desirable energy-level alignments in CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs are keys to reducing energy losses and improving   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  . In order to improve the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of a   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   device, Chen  et  al. applied a gradient thermal annealing and anti solvent  method to retard the crystallization process of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  film,  resulting in a uniform and high-quality perovskite film and an  improved   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.23~\\mathrm{V}.^{[19]}$   Tian et al. introduced an amino-functionalized polymer, PN4N, as a novel cathode interlayer, demonstrating that the PN4N interlayer is conducive to the quality  of the perovskite film, and the conduction-band alignment  between the electron transport layer and perovskite resulted  in an improved   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.30\\,\\mathrm{\\:V}.^{[20]}$   Our group has developed a  precursor engineering method using   $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Ac})_{2}$   as an additive to  enhance the built-in potential in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs, leading to a  significant enhancement of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   from 1.22 to   $1.30~\\mathrm{V}.^{[21]}$   However,  the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   relative to the bandgap of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$     $(E_{\\mathrm{g}};~1.92~\\mathrm{eV})$   is  still as high as   $0.62\\;\\mathrm{eV}.$   To date, the champion PCE of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    PSCs has reached   $16.58\\%$   with a low   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.23~\\mathrm{V}$   and a severe   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   of   $0.69\\ \\mathrm{eV}.^{[13]}$   Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$    to improve the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and thus the PCE of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells.  \n\nThe champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic– inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed  to a certified value of   $25.2\\%$  .  However, the labile organic cationic methyl amine (MA) and form amid in e (FA) components in  the hybrid per ovsk ites easily escape or decompose at high temperature, which leads to poor long-term stability of hybrid PSCs  under heat and high-humidity conditions.  To overcome the  instability issue of the organic cations, a series of heat-resistant  inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   (X: I, Br, or mixed halides) per ovsk ites have  been developed for PSCs, which are also tolerant to oxygen  exposure and ultraviolet irradiation.  Among all the inorganic per ovsk ites, the mixed halide   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   has attracted  intensive attention due to its excellent thermal/light soaking  stability and suitable direct bandgap, potentially in the front cell  for perovskite-silicon hybrid tandem applications.  Numerous  studies have been carried out regarding   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs.  \n\nIn this work, we report that the photovoltaic parameters, i.e.,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  , FF, and PCE of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs can be improved simultaneously by introducing a very small amount of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$     $(0.5\\%)$    into the perovskite precursor solution. It is found that the   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive can significantly enhance the crystal quality, thus  reducing the defect density and increasing the carrier lifetime  of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, as well as increase the Fermi level of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and raise the built-in potential and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
