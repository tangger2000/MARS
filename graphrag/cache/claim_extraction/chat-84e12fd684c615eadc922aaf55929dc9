Here, we fabricate a commercial UV chip $(365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$ pumped warm white-LED by mixing $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}:Sb}$ with the commercial blue phosphor $\\mathrm{BaMgAl_{10}O_{17}Eu^{2+}}$ and green phosphor $\\mathrm{SrSi}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\mathrm{N}_{2}{:}\\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$. A warm white-LED with a Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage CIE coordinate of (0.40, 0.38), correlated color temperature (CCT) of $3416\\mathrm{~K},$ , and the color rendering index (CRI) of 95.4 is obtained (Figure S18a,b, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, a NIR-LED device can be fabricated by combining $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl_{6};Pb,Yb}$ b with a commercial $365~\\mathrm{~nm~}~\\mathrm{UV}$ chip (Figure S19a, Supporting Information). The pc-LED emits a much stronger NIR emission than visible emission. A slight spectral deviation between the lamp and the phosphor is related to the calibration difference of the used spectrometers. With the increase of the driving current from 20 to $300~\\mathrm{mA}$ , a linear increase of the NIR emission intensity is observed, with no premature saturation toward the UV light excitation (Figure S19b, Supporting Information). The as-fabricated NIR-LED device with strong NIR luminescence makes it suitable as the light source for night-vision technologies. As can be seen in Figure 5 a–c, printed paper is clear under natural light (Figure 5a). When the natural light is off, no image can be captured by the NIR camera (Figure  5b). By contrast, once the NIR LED is ignited, a black-and-white image with clear Chinese characters can be recorded by the NIR camera (Figure 5c). Therefore, these results reveal great potential of the $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ co-doped $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}}$ phosphor in night-vision technologies and other related fields including medical and food industries. Furthermore, $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AglnCl_{6}:St}$ combined with $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6};Pb,Yb}$ can be used for information encryption patterns. As shown in Figure  5d-f, we designed information encryption patterns by screen printing $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}:Sb}$ (QR code) and $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6};St}_{1}\\mathrm{b},$ (pattern) to form a composite pattern. The pattern composed of $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}:Sb}$ and $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6};St}_{1}\\mathrm{b},$ is invisible under daylight to the human eye or visible camera (Figure 5d). However, once placed under UV light, a QD code pattern composed of $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}:Sb}$ is presented and can be captured by visible camera (Figure  5e), while a pattern composed of $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6};St}_{1}\\mathrm{b},$ can be detected by NIR camera (Figure 5f). This strongly supports their unique advantages for visible and NIR multi-mode optical information encryption. In summary, $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$ singly doped and $\\mathrm{{Sh}^{3+}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{Y}b^{3+}}}$ co-doped $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}}$ DPs are successfully designed and synthesized by the solution synthesis method. The experiments and DFT theoretical analysis reveal that the STE emission intensity of $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}}$ is greatly enhanced by 240 times and redshifts from $600\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ to $660\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ after $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$ ions doping, which leads to a larger spectral overlap with the absorption peaks of $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$ ions. Profiting from the bright STE emission and better resonance with $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$ ions, the highest NIR PLQY of up to $50\\%$ is realized by efficient energy transfer from STEs to $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$ ions. The excellent optical performance combined with high ambient, thermal, and light stability makes $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}:St}$ and $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}AgInCl_{6}}$ :Sb,Yb DPs have a good application in NIR LED, night-vision device, and optical information encryption.

The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.
