Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Colloidal QDs of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   were synthesized by a simple and green method using ethanol as the main  solvent. The photo luminescence peak can be tuned from 393  to   $545~\\mathrm{nm}$   with different halide compositions made via mixing  different precursors during synthesis. For   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs, we  observed an emission peak at  $410\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and an FWHM of   $48~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  ,  and a small stokes shift of   $15~\\mathrm{nm}$   and a PLQY of   ${\\approx}19.4\\%$  . This  PLQY is higher than the all-inorganic Pb-based QDs   $\\mathrm{(CsPbCl}_{3}$  ,  emission wavelength:   $405~\\mathrm{~nm}$  , PLQY:   $10\\%$  ,  and comparable with organic–inorganic layered perovskite   $(\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{4};$  ,  PEA:   $\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{5}C H_{2}C H_{2}N H_{3}}$  , emission wavelength:   $410\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , PLQY:   $26\\%$  ).  Furthermore, we also found that   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs were  self-passivated by the hydrolytic product BiOBr and demonstrated  much improved stability than hybrid Bi-based and lead-based perovskites, a significant advantage for their potential application.  \n\n# 2. Results and Discussions  \n\nSince   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   remains rarely explored so far, we first grew  and studied   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystals for a better understanding  of the basic structural and optical properties of this material.   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystals were grown by an inverse temperature  crystallization method. The precursor solution was prepared by  stoic hio metric mixture of cesium bromide and bismuth bromide dissolved in hot hydrobromic acid (HBr). The cooling rate  was adjusted so that crystals of centimeter size were formed  in a period of several days. After cooling to room temperature,  hexagonal and yellowish single crystal with a size of   $3.86\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times$   $2.24\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}\\,\\times\\,1.32\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}$   was successfully obtained ( Figure   1 a,  inset). X-ray diffraction measurement was applied to characterize the structure of single crystal and the result is shown  in Figure 1a. There are only diffraction patterns from   $\\{001\\}$    peaks and the FWHM of (002) diffraction reached   $0.08^{\\circ}$  , indicating the high single crystal lin it y. The   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystal  was hexagonal structure (space group   $P{-}3m1$  ,   $a\\,=\\,0.796\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ,   $c=0.984~\\mathrm{nm}$  ), which is consistent with previous reports.  \n\nThermo grav i metric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning  calorimetry were carried out under nitrogen flow from room  temperature to   $800\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   to investigate the thermal stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   in comparison with that of   $\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$  . Results are  shown in Figure 1b and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. Weight loss started at  ${\\approx}496~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}_{;}$  , and then sharply increased  after   $612\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , corresponding to the boiling of   $\\mathrm{BiBr}_{3}^{[29]}$   and sublimation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Br}^{[30]}$   separately. In contrast,   $\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   began to  lose weight at  ${\\approx}200\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and lost all its mass before   $400~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , due  to the easy decomposition of   $\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   and fast sublimation of  MABr. Clearly, all inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   has much better thermal  stability than its hybrid counterpart.  \n\nThe photo luminescence (PL) spectrum (Figure 1c) reveals  that the fluorescence of bulk   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   had higher intensity  and narrower FHMW of   ${\\approx}31\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}}$   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/0a48136e31acfc54b1d890be16b2a7d120de0ae66485fbf0a5f162a478f8bf20-1727077490.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   single crystal. a) XRD pattern.

In addition, the PL  spectrum displays an emission with its emission peak   $(473\\:\\mathrm{nm})$    almost identical to the absorption onset, which was fitted as  2.61 eV (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It should be  noted that there were actually two peaks in the PL spectrum.  The peak at the shorter wavelength   $(473\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   can be ascribed  to band gap emission, while the shoulder peak at the longer  wavelength (  $(496~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) may originate from bulk defects in the  single crystal, which was supported by the theoretical calculation in the report of Mitzi and co-workers.  Time-resolved PL  spectrum (Figure 1d) was measured to gain more insights into  the exciton recombination dynamics. The PL decay can be fitted  by a bi exponential function (Equation (1)), yielding a short lifetime of 7.24 ns   $(\\tau_{1})$   with a percentage of   $75.9\\%$   originated from  the high trap density related to the crystal surface while a long  component of 43.0 ns   $(\\tau_{2})$   with a percentage of   $24.1\\%$   that may  correlate with the carrier recombination in defect-free bulk  crystal  \n\n$$\nF(t)=F_{1}\\exp\\!\\left({\\frac{-t}{\\tau_{1}}}\\right)+F_{2}\\exp\\!\\left({\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
