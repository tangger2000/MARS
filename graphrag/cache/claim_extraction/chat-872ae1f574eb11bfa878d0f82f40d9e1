Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Further study should be done to investigate the  impact of organic terminal groups on the stability and photovoltaic performance of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells based  on other types of absorbers such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$  .  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The FTO-coated glasses were etched with zinc  powder and   $\\mathsf{I}_{\\mathsf{\\Delta\\mathrm{~M~}}}\\mathsf{H C I}$   to obtain patterned substrates. The patterned  substrates were then washed with detergent, deionized water, ethanol,  and acetone for 20 min each. After being dried with a stream of   $\\mathsf{N}_{2},$   the  substrates were treated with an ultraviolet plasma for   $30\\;\\mathsf{m i n}$   to remove  organic residues. Then, poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)amine)  (PTAA) dissolved in toluene at a concentration of   $5~\\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$   was spincoated onto the FTO substrate at a speed of 6000  rpm for   $30\\,\\mathrm{\\sf~s},$  , and  the substrate was then annealed at   $120\\,\\,\\,\\,{}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $20~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The perovskite  precursor solution composed of   $0.8\\,\\mathrm{\\M~}\\,\\mathsf{H P b}|_{3}$   and   $0.8\\,\\mathrm{~\\textmu~}\\,{\\sf C s l}$   in  N , N - dimethyl form amide without or with the addition of OTG molecules   $(0.1\\mathrm{-}1\\%$   in molar ratio) was then stirred at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   overnight, and the  resulting solution was spin-coated on the PTAA layer (preheated at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C})$   at 2000 rpm for   $35\\ \\mathsf{s}$  . The substrate was then annealed at   $90~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$    for 5 min and   $\\ 750\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $20~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . A layer of [6,6]phenyl C61 butyric acid  methyl ester (PCBM) was then deposited by spin-coating  $25~\\mathsf{m g\\,m L^{-1}}$   of  PCBM chl oro benzene solution onto the perovskite film at   $800\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  and heating at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . Bath o cup roi ne (BCP) was then  coated onto the PCBM layer by depositing  $140\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of methanol-saturated  solution drop by drop at 6000  rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{~s~}$   followed by annealing at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 5  min. All of these steps were conducted in a   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$  -protected  glove box in which the partial pressures of   $\\mathsf{O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$   were less than  0.01 ppm. Finally, a  $100\\;\\mathsf{n m}$   layer of silver was thermally evaporated onto  the as-prepared films to serve as an electrode under high vacuum (lower  than  $2\\times10^{-4}\\ \\mathsf{P a}_{,}$  ).  \n\nFilm Characterization : A field-emission scanning electron microscope  (JSM-7800F Prime, JEOL) was used to observe the morphology of  the as-obtained perovskite films. The steady-state photo luminescence  spectrum was measured with a Horiba Fluoromax-4 fluorescence  spectrometer using a 500 nm excitation light source. The time-resolved  photo luminescence decay was recorded with a Horiba Fluorolog-3 Time  Correlated Single Photon Counting system with the excitation wavelength  fixed at   $440\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  . The XPS analysis was carried out on a Kratos AXIS Ultra  DLD spectrometer with an Al   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  X-ray source. The XRD patterns were  measured on a Rigaku Ultima IV powder X-ray diffract o meter using  $\\mathsf{C u}$     $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  radiation source with a scan rate of   $5^{\\circ}\\,\\mathsf{m i n}^{-1}$  . The UV–vis absorption  spectra of the perovskite samples were recorded with a Shimadzu  UV 2450 spectrometer. TGA measurements were conducted on a  thermo grav i metric analyzer (Pyris 1 TGA) in the nitrogen atmosphere  with a heating rate of   $10\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}\\ \\mathsf{m i n}^{-1}$  . Liquid-state   $^1{\\sf H}$   NMR analysis was  performed on the   $600\\ \\mathsf{M H z}$   nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer  (Avance III600 MHz) using d6-DMSO as deuterated solvent. ToF-SIMS  measurements were performed using the focused ion beam ToF-SIMS  spectrometer (GAIA3 GMU Model 2016, Czech). A   $30\\;\\mathrm{\\sf~keV}\\;\\mathrm{\\sf~Bi^{+}}$   ion  beam was used as the primary ion beam to peel the samples with an  analysis area of   $5\\,\\times\\,5\\,\\,\\upmu m^{2}$  . The linear voltage sweep analysis used to  investigate the space charge limited current curves was performed on  a multi functional electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany), with  a constant step voltage of  $20\\ \\mathsf{m V}$   and a scan window from  $0\\;\\vee$   to  $4\\;\\lor.$  \n\nDevice Characterization:  $J^{-V}$  curves of the PSCs were measured with a  digital source meter (Keithley 2400) under simulated solar illumination  of   $100\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   (AM 1.5G). The intensity of the light source was  determined with a standard silicon reference cell (Wacom Denso Co.,  Japan). The measurements were conducted by a reverse (from 1.2 to   $-0.2\\;\\forall)$  ) or forward (from  $-0.2$   to 1.2 V) scan. The step voltage and delay  time were fixed at  $10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$   and  $30\\:\\mathsf{m s}$  , respectively. Monochromatic internal  photon-to-current efficiency spectral measurements were characterized  by using a monochromatic incident light with an irradiance of   $\\rceil\\times\\rceil0^{\\rceil6}$    photons   $\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}\\ \\mathsf{s}^{-1}$   in direct-current mode. The TPV measurement was  recorded on a multi functional electrochemical analysis instrument  (Zahner, Germany). The emission light was generated by a pulse of  white light incident on solar cells under open-circuit conditions. No  background light was applied. The photo stability of the PSCs was tested  with continuous illumination from a white LED lamp   $(\\uparrow00\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\ c m^{-2})$  ).  The devices were put in a glass dry box with a relative humidity of less  than  $\\rceil0\\%$  .
