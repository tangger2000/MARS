This structure contributed to a  highly enhanced photo current of the PD compared with the flat  counterpart as a result of higher light absorption. (Figure 2g).  \n\nPolymer substrate based wearable PDs with a higher  stretching capacity (up to   $600\\%$  ) has been reported by using a  unique helical structure.    $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanoparticles were coated on  the PDMS substrate precoated on a screw as the seed layer for  growth of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanobranch arrays by hydrothermal synthesis.  Then half side of the screw was coated using   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   paste as the  contacts. A helical structure device would take shape when  peeling the whole substrate from the screw thread, as illustrated in Figure 2d. This PD possesses a high stretch ability of   $\\approx\\!\\!600\\%$   strain (see Figure 2h). Such a high stretch ability mainly  benefits from the unique helical structure that rotates to accommodate deformation and thus it is very promising for construction of other wearable devices. With the same design principle  of turning 2D shape into 3D architectures, configured polymer  films served as the substrate to support graphene and   ${\\mathrm{MoS}}_{2}$  active material for constructions of 3D flexible PD.  \n\nPolymer substrates are frequently employed in wearable PDs  thanks to their own advantages: 1. Easy access to polymer. 2.  The thickness and the shape of the substrate can be precisely  controlled. 3. The intrinsic flexibility of polymer. 4. The possibility for large-scale applications. However, there still exist challenges. Even though polymer substrates exhibit certain intrinsic  flexibility, such flexibility is unsatisfactory without geometrical  design. Besides, the surface of polymer is generally slippery,  which hampers the adherence of materials.  \n\n# 2.2. Paper Substrate  \n\nPaper substrate is another commonly used substrate for the  fabrication of wearable PDs due to its adequate availability, low  cost, mechanical flexibility, and bio compatibility.  The fundamental design principles of paper substrate based PDs are  partially similar to that of polymer substrate based PDs. Works  related to paper substrate based wearable PDs shared some similarities in the efforts on exploring nano materials and organic  materials with polymer substrate based PDs, by taking advantage  of the intrinsic flexibility of these materials or structures.  \n\nHowever, there is a better adhesion between paper and materials due to the porous structure of paper. Thus, some PDs  taking advantage of the hygroscopic it y have been proposed.  In addition, the bend ability of paper being better than that of  paper leads to structural designs such as origami. Moreover,  paper substrate is extremely favorable for the construction of  environment-friendly and disposable devices.  \n\nTaking advantage of the hygroscopic it y and porous structure  of paper,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   were synthesized as the photo active  material on cellulose paper pre saturated with seed solution  via hydrothermal growth as shown in  Figure    3 a. Recently, a  paper substrate based ultraviolet (UV) PD using a photoelectrochromic ink has been presented by Zou et al.  This work  made full use of the moisture absorption property of paper by  adopting a photo electro chromic ink as the photo active material to indicate the type (UV-A, UV-B, or UV-C) and intensity  of the ultraviolet light. Ph os p homo ly b dic acid (PMA), which is  light yellow (almost colorless) with the absorption peak at about   $310\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   on its pristine stage and turns heteropoly blue when  it is reduced under UV illumination with changed absorption  edge, was selected as the photo active material with lactic acid  (LA) as the   $\\mathrm{e}^{-}$   donor. The invisible aqueous solution containing  PMA and LA was drawn on paper substrate with transparency films as the coating filters as shown in Figure 3b. When  exposed to UV light, the color of smileys changed and the  color-changing degree depended on the dosage of UV light.  Thus, this paper substrate based UV PD not only was nakedeye observable but also could be tuned according to the specific need of individuals, for the UV light dosage absorbed  by photo active materials can be modulated by changing the  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/d2cf898db1e3f723636d784c93a26f008b6cdb3a4687147b172d6a25b096739a-1727123119.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   Paper substrate based photodetector s.

Furthermore, the  absorption s of the active material for UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C  were discrepant, which helped to differentiate the illuminated  light. This distinguishing capacity was highly favorable for discerning three types of UV lights which hold remarkable difference in effect on human body.  \n\nStrategies such as applying origami to the paper substrate,  would greatly enhance the stretch ability and spatial recognition  of a PD. Fang et al. proposed a spatially discernible wearable PD  as shown in Figure 3c.    $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   and pencil trace were  used as the active material and electrodes, respectively. The as  prepared PD showed stable op to electronic properties even after  1000 bending cycles. Also inspired by origami technology, a  wearable PD that could be stretched up to   $1000\\%$   strain, twisted  up to   $360^{\\circ}$  , and bended up to   $\\pm30^{\\circ}$   while still maintaining  a decent detecting capacity was presented.  Carbon pastes  were first screen-printed onto a piece of paper followed by the  screen-printing of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowire ink. The whole system was  then folded into a Miura-origami structure with silver paste to  reinforce the foldlines as shown in Figure 3d.  \n\n# 2.3. Fiber Substrate Based PDs  \n\nFiber, as an intrinsically flexible and wearable structure, is a  promising candidate for developing wearable PDs. Several  eye-catching work of wearable PDs based on fiber substrates  has been reported recently where nickel wires, titanium wires,  Kevlar fibers, carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   fibers, etc.  were employed.  According to current fiber based PDs,  the most extensively used fibers for wearable PDs are metal  fibers (for it can serve as an electrode as well as the reactant  for photo­ active material synthesis) and polymer fibers (for it  can be reformed into any shape with little effort and serve as  encapsulation material).  Semiconductor fibers and CNT  fibers are also used as substrates for wearable PDs but relevant  studies are not as abundant as the former ones. On the basis of  bendable fibers, the close and robust interface between active  materials and fiber substrate is a primary requisite for wearable  PDs.  \n\nA typical fiber based PD has a twisting structure, with one  fiber electrode incorporated with photo active materials, and  entwined by the other fiber electrode, as demonstrated by the   $\\mathrm{p{\\cdot}C u Z n S/n{\\cdot}T i O_{2}}$   photodetector from Xu et al.  The Ti microfiber played three roles here. First, it worked as the substrate to  provide the device with strength and flexibility. Second, it functioned as the electrode with a high electrical conductivity. Third,  it served as the source for growth of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   nanotube arrays. A  transparent p-type conducting   $\\mathrm{{CuZnS}}$   film was then conformably deposited on   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   nanotube arrays to form a heterojunction. The other electrode, carbon nanotubes fiber, was twisted  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/ec332f045b0c720fad748e953a1d48caec4f7eea14711cc3376469e41149d512-1727123030.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   Fiber substrate based photodetector s.
