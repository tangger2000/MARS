Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The precursor solution was stirred for   $^\\mathrm{~4~h~}$   and then filtered  through  $0.45~\\upmu\\mathsf{m}$   syringe filter for later use. For HTL precursor solution,   $90~\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}$   Spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in   $\\mathsf{I m L}$   CB, doped with   $36~\\upmu L$   t-BP  and  $22\\,\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   acetonitrile solution of Li-TFSI   $(520~\\mathsf{m g\\;m L^{-1}})$  ).  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The   $2.5\\,\\times\\,2.5\\,\\textsf{c m}^{2}$   glass/FTO substrates were  first ultrasonically cleaned by ultra-pure water with glass cleaner for   $30\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  , and then twice with ultra-pure water for 30Â  min each time.  The cleaned FTO glass substrates were blown to dry with compressed  air and treated with UV-Ozone for   $15~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The diluted   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   colloidal  dispersion liquid was spin-coated onto FTO in the air, with a speed of  3000Â rpm for   $40~\\mathrm{s}$  . The   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   film was annealed at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30\\,\\,\\mathsf{m i n}$    and UV treated for 10Â  min after cooling down to room temperature.  Subsequently, the aqueous solution of PBGH was spin-coated on top  of the   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   film at 4000Â rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   and annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $10\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$    to evaporate the solvent. Then the substrates were transferred into  the glovebox for perovskite film fabrication. The perovskite precursor  solution was spun at 1000Â rpm for 10Â s, followed by 4000Â rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  ,  and diethyl ether was dropped at   $20~s$   after start. Afterward, the film  was annealed at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  , and pure   $\\alpha\\mathrm{\\Omega}$  -phase perovskite film  was obtained. Then   $50~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   Spiro-OMeTAD solution was coated on the  film and spun at 5000Â rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  . Finally,  $80~\\mathsf{n m}$   thick gold was vapor  deposited on the films.  \n\nCharacterization : SEM images were obtained by field-emission SEM  (HITACHI, SU-8020). AFM images were obtained on a Veeco NanoScope  IV. Water contact angles for   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and perovskite were measured using  a Data Physics OCA 20. The absorption and transmission spectra were  measured using a UVâvis NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda  950). XRD patterns were acquired by D/Max-3c diffract o meter (copper   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha,\\dot{\\mathsf{\\lambda}}=1.54\\ \\mathring{\\mathsf{A}},$  , 40Â  kV). PL (excitation at   $510\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m}$  ) were tested with a  FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd), and TRPL spectra  were obtained by a PicoQuant FluoQuant 300. XPS were performed by a  photoelectron spectrometer (E SCALA B 250 Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific).  FTIR spectra were obtained by BRUKER-VERTEX 70.   $^{13}{\\sf C}$   NMR was tested  with Ascend TM 400.  $J^{-V}$  curves were tested by  I - V  test system SANEIELECTRIC-XOP-50S1. The EQE spectra was obtained using a QTest  Station 2000ADI system (Crowntech Inc.). EIS was performed on a  Zahner Electrochemical Workstation.  \n\nStatistics Analysis : All statistical analysis were performed by using  Origin 2021, and all the data kept two significant digits after the  decimal points by the rounding-off method. The data obtained from  SEM, AFM, UVâvis, PL, TRPL, Transmission, contact angles, XPS,  UPS, NMR,  $J^{-V}$  and EQE are the original data without normalized.  The other data were obtained by transferring corresponding original  data according to the calculation formula. Linear fittings were applied  to MottâGurney plot (FigureÂ  2b), currentâvoltage curves (FiguresÂ  2a   $V_{\\mathrm{{osc}}}$   versus light intensity plots (Figure  $^{48,}$  ) and MottâSchottky  plots (FigureÂ  4f). Bi-exponential decay function was applied to TRPL  decays to infer the carrier extraction/recombination dynamics. The  statistical distribution data of PCE,  J sc,  V oc, and FF were got from 40  devices each.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nM.W. and Y.D. contributed equally to this work.
