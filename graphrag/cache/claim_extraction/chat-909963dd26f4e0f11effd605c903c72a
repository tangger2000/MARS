More importantly, the light-weight,  low cost and flexibility of perovskite (PVK)  endow it as a great candidate for the development of flexible perovskite solar cells  (f-PSCs),  which opens a niche market  for applications including wearable and  portable  electronics,  shaped  display  devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc.   Through the engineering of devices architectures, materials and inter facial layers,  PCE of the f-PSCs has exceeded   $23\\%$   to  date.  \n\nWith rapid development of photovoltaic technology, flexible perovskite solar  cells (f-PSCs) have attracted much attention for their light weight, high  flexibility and portability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE)  achieved so far is not yet comparable to that of rigid devices. This is mainly  due to the great challenge of depositing homogeneous and high-quality  perovskite films on flexible substrate. In this study, the pre-buried 3-amino prop ionic acid hydro iodide (3AAH) additives into the electron transport  layer (ETL) and modified the ETL/perovskite (PVK) interface by a bottom-up  strategy. 3AAH treatment induced a templated perovskite grain growth and  improved the quality of the ETL. By this, the residual stresses generated in  PVK during the annealing-cooling process are released and converted into  micro-compressive stresses. As a result, the defect density of f-PSCs with  pre-buried 3AAH is reduced and the photovoltaic performance is greatly  improved, reaching an exceptional PCE of  $\\mathbf{23.36\\%}$  . This strategy provides a  new idea to bridge the gap between flexible and rigid devices.  \n\nCurrently, most advanced f-PSCs are  based on n-i-p structure by using   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    as the electron transport layer (ETL), due  to its outstanding electron mobility, high  optical transmittance, low processing temperature and matched energy level alignment with those of the PVKs.

The lower toughness and   $\\mathsf{G}_{\\mathsf{C}}$   values of PVK contribute to the accumulation of residual  stresses.

This is extremely detrimental to the photovoltaic  performance and long-term stability of PSCs.

Last but  not least, it would be quite challenge to realize a good mechanical flexibility of the f-PSCs by utilizing the rigid inorganic   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    as ETL, which easily generates cracks under bending tests.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nOrganic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one  of the current hot topics in photovoltaic research, which are  mainly due to their low fabrication cost, solution-process ability  and excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE). The PCE of  PSCs has rapidly surged from the initial   $3.8\\%$   to   $25.8\\%$   over  the past decade, showing great potential toward commercial iz a  \n\nToward the end of developing highly efficient ad flexible  f-PSCs, significant attempts have been devoted to address the  above issues. For instance, Zuo et al. introduced buffer layers  such as polystyrene and self-assembled molecules (SAMs) to the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$   interface, which has been demonstrated to alleviate  the tensile stress of PVK films and improve device stability.   To passivate   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   defects and obtain better ETL/PVK interfacial properties, Zheng et  al. used the volatile organic salt   $\\mathrm{HCDONH_{4}}$   to modify the ETL.  Due to the interaction  between   $\\mathrm{HCOO^{-}}$   and  $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  , the additive evaporated at high temperature promoted the growth of PVK grains and reduced the  defects on the ETL surface.  \n\nIn this work, we pre-buried 3-Amino prop ionic Acid Hydroiodide (3AAH) as an organic additive in   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  . The ETL/PVK  interface was modified by a bottom-up strategy to assist the  growth of PVK grains and improve the quality of the ETL layer  at the meantime. This strategy effectively released the residual  stresses in PVK during the annealing-cooling process and  transformed them into micro-compressive stresses, which enabled the PVK to crystallize into a thermodynamic ally favorable  state. Additionally, the pre-buried 3AAH greatly reduces the  defects at the ETL/PVK interface and the bulk defects of PVK.  As a result, we obtain an outstanding PCE of   $23.36\\%$   for f-PSCs,  with open circuit voltage   $(\\mathrm{V_{OC}})$   of 1.187 V, short-circuit current  density   $\\left(\\mathrm{J}_{S C}\\right)$   of   $24.45\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , fill factor (FF) of   $80.47\\%$  . And  after 4000 cycles of bending (  $\\mathtt{R}=5$   mm),  $84\\%$   of the initial PCE  is still maintained. Our work reduces the gap between flexible  PSCs and rigid devices and provides a new idea to improve the  performance of f-PSCs.  \n\n# 2. Results and Discussion  \n\nAs shown in  Figure    1 a, 3-Amino prop ionic Acid Hydroiodide (3AAH) is used as a pre-buried additive in   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    electron transfer layer (ETL), and the device structure   $\\mathrm{ITO/ETL/FAPbI}_{3}/3$  Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag of the f-PSCs has also  been demonstrated. The optical transmittance spectra of PEN/ ITO, PEN/  $\\mathrm{ITO+S n O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{PEN/ITO+S n O_{2}+3A A H}$   substrates  are illustrated in Figure 1b. It is obvious that the transmittance  of   $\\mathrm{PEN/ITO+S n O_{2}+3A A H}$   is enhanced in the visible range,  which might be attributed to the refined crystallization of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  .  The high transmittance enables more visible photon absorbed  by the PVK film, which expects to improve the short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$   of the f-PSCs. The crystal phases and microstructures of pristine and w/3AAH   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   films are studied in  Figure S1 (Supporting Information). It is observed that incorporating 3AAH into  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   does not cause the obvious peak shift  nor change the crystal phase. The micro structure of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   is  characterized by high-resolution transmission electronic microscope (HRTEM). From the results in Figure  S1c (Supporting  Information), the pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   shows a mixture of (110) and  (101) crystal planes corresponding to 3.38 and   $2.67\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   lattice  spacing, respectively, while,   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  presents a high\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
