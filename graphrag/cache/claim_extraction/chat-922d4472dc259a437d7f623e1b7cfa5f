Stability Enhancement by Ligand Design  \n\nLigands stabilize the QD surface to reduce fragile dangling bonds  and functional ize the QDs for various applications.  Ligands  can bind to the QD surface via a variety of chemical anchor  groups, as shown in  Figure    4 . L-type ligands have a lone electron pair that coordinates to metals and semiconductor surfaces.  Alkyl phosphines   $\\left(\\mathrm{R}_{3}\\mathrm{P}\\right)$  , alkyl phosphine oxides   $(\\mathrm{R}_{3}\\mathrm{PO})$  , and alkylamines   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{2})$   are representative L-type ligands. X-type ligands  have a negative ion, and require one electron from the surface of  the metal of a semi-conductor QD to form a two-electron covalent bond. Alkyl carboxylic acids (RCOOH), alkyl thiols (RSH),  and alkyl phosphonic acids   $\\left(\\mathrm{RPC}_{3}\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\right)$   are representative X-type  ligands. L-type ligands are easily desorbed by purification in the  case of CdSe or InP QDs, but X-type ligands are not desorbed  because of their strong covalent bonds with the QD surface.  \n\nCreating strong binding with ligands and creating steric hindrance are effective ways to enhance the stability of QDs, as summarized in Table 2. Strong binding between the anchor groups  and QDs enhances the photo stability and thermal stability of  the QDs.  Alkylthiol ligands result in better thermal stability than carboxylic acid ligands. For example, CdSe/ZnS QDs  capped with do de cane thi ol maintained   $60\\%$   of their initial PL  intensity under a   $70–170\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   thermal control system for   $12\\textrm{h}$  ,  while the analogous QDs with oleic acid (OA) maintained only   $34.8\\%$   of their PL intensity.

QDs with the z witter ionic ligands fully maintained their quantum yield in ambient condition after   $28\\,\\mathrm{~d~}$  ,  while QDs with OA ligands maintained only   $25\\%$   of their initial  quantum yield. The introduction of steric hindrance by ligands  has been reported to drastically enhance the stability of perovskite QDs. Tri $\\cdot n$  -oct yl phosphine, trin -oct yl phosphine oxide, tetrade cy lp hos phonic acid (TDPA), and 2,2-im in odi benz oic acid have  been used to enhance the stability of perovskite QDs against air  and water.  For example,  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   perovskite QDs with TDPA  ligands maintained   $75\\%$   of their initial PL intensity under water  after   $5\\mathrm{~h~}$  , while bare   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs maintained only   $7\\%$   of their  PL intensity after an hour.  However, strong thiol ligands do  not help to enhance the stability of perovskite QDs, because the  thiol anchor groups destroy the crystal lin it y of the QDs due to the  great binding force with lead halide.  Thus, the PL intensity  of perovskite QDs is drastically decreased by thiol ligands.  \n\n# 3.3. Stability Enhancement by Over coating of QDs  \n\nOver coating enhances QD stability by protecting the QDs from  air, moisture, heat, and high energy light, as summarized in  Table 3, but the over coating should be tailored to avoid quantum  yield reduction and wavelength change.  Inorganic over coating  to enhance photo stability, acid stability, and thermal stability  has been achieved using air-stable inorganic salts, such as   ${\\mathrm{BaSO}}_{4}$  , and KCl, or metal–organic complexes.  Over coating  by inorganic salts is reported to cause the redshift of the emission wavelength due to aggregation. Metal–organic complexes  do not cause this redshift, and can also enhance the quantum  yield. For example, coating with   $\\mathrm{Ti(i{\\cdot}P r O)_{4}}$   slightly enhanced the  quantum yield of   $\\mathrm{InP/ZnSeS/ZnS}$   QDs from   $80\\%$   to   $83\\%$  . The   $\\mathrm{Ti(i{\\cdot}P r O)_{4}}$  -complexed   $\\mathrm{InP/ZnSeS/ZnS}$   QDs maintained   $75\\%$   of their initial PL intensity after  $24{\\mathrm{~h~}}$   of   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$   UV irradiation without any redshift, while the bare   $\\mathrm{InP/ZnSeS/ZnS}$   QDs  maintained only  $30\\%$   of their PL intensity under the same conditions. The   $\\mathrm{Ti(i{\\cdot}P r O)_{4}}$  -complexed   $\\mathrm{InP/ZnSeS/ZnS}$   QDs also  maintained  $93\\%$   of their PL intensity after thermal treatment at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for  $4\\,\\mathrm{{h}}$  , while the  $\\mathrm{InP/ZnSeS/ZnS}$   QDs only maintained   $55\\%$   of their PL intensity under these conditions.  \n\nOxide over coating is an excellent way to protect QDs from  water and oxygen, but careful control is required not to lose  quantum yield and stability simultaneously.  For example,   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   over coating enhanced the quantum yield of   $\\mathrm{InP/Zns}$  QDs from   $48\\%$   to   $59\\%$  .  The   $\\mathrm{InP/Zns}$   QDs with an   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  over coating maintained   $86\\%$   of their initial quantum yield   $(59\\%\\to51\\%)$  ) after being exposed to   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}\\,\\mathrm{\\UV}$   irradiation  for   $100\\textrm{h}$  , while the quantum yield of the bare   $\\mathrm{InP/Zns}$   QDs  decreased drastically   $(48\\%\\to9\\%)$  ). Enhancement of the photostability of perovskite QDs by oxide over coating has also been  demonstrated.  A   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}/\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   coating was formed on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  using disec -but oxy alum in oxy trie th oxys i lane.
