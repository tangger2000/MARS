The content focuses on the synthesis and characterization of PBSCF powder and its performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The entities mentioned in the text are related to materials science, such as PBSCF powder, oxygen vacancies, and electrochemical reduction, but these do not match the entity specification provided.<|>The OER performance of PBSCF powder was also found to be strongly improved after electrochemical reduction (-0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl). As shown in the polarization curve (Figure 5d), the potential at 10 mA cm-2 decreased by 88, 90, 104, and 103 mV after electrochemical reduction for 200 s (P-V-200s), 10 min (P-V-10m), 20 min (P-V-20 min), and 30 min (P-V-30 min), respectively. The Tafel slopes changed from 92 mV dec-1 for the pristine PBSCF powder to 75, 74, 70, and 71 mV dec-1 for the ones subjected to 200 s, 10, 20, and 30 min electrochemical reduction (Figure S13b, Supporting Information), respectively. The Rct showed clear decrease after electrochemical reduction, with the smallest value for P-V-20 min.<|>The effects of bias applied during electrochemical reduction on the OER activities were also compared. As shown in Figure S16a,b in the Supporting Information, OER activities were compared for PBSCF films subjected to the electrochemical reduction at a voltage of -0.4, -0.6, and -0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl,) for 20 min. The PBSCF powder bias treatment at -0.6 V showed the lowest over potential at 10 mA cm-2 and smallest Rct. All the electrochemical tests indicate that the PBSCF powder subjected to 20 min electrochemical reduction under -0.6 V showed the highest performance, suggesting its optimal oxygen deficiency for facilitating the OER to occur.<|>Consistent with the results we obtained for thin film, the oxygen vacancies were found to distribute differently in the PBSCF powder subjected to thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction. The lattice parameter of PBSCF expanded significantly after generating oxygen vacancies by thermal annealing (Figure 5c), but did not show noticeable changes after electrochemical reduction (Figure 5f). These results indicated that the oxygen vacancies in thermally annealed PBSCF powder were distributed through the bulk of the powder, while the oxygen vacancies generated by electrochemical reduction is likely to be located at the surface region. As a result, the electrochemical reduction was capable of introducing higher density of oxygen vacancies on the surface while maintaining the bulk crystal structure. This can be the reason why we could observe an optimal oxygen vacancy content in electrochemically reduced PBSCF. The thermally annealed ones were already decomposed before reaching the optimal oxygen deficiency.<|>To evaluate the stability of PBSCF powder, chrono potentiometry was carried out for 10 h at 10 mA cm-2. There was little observable change for P-pristine, P-H-6h, and P-V-20 min in the potential after chrono potentiometry test for 10 h, whereas the potential for IrO2 showed obvious increase from the original 1.67 to 1.75 V after 5 h test (Figure 5g). These results suggest that both the pristine PBSCF powder and the treated ones have high stability under the OER condition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement showed that both thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction induced negligible changes in the microstructure of the PBSCF powders (Figure 5h and Figure S17a–f, Supporting Information).<|>For the PBSCF NT with diameters of ≈200 nm, we carried out similar treatment to introduce oxygen vacancies and evaluate the changes in OER performance as we did for PBSCF powder.<|>The OER activity of PBSCF NTs was found to degrade after thermal annealing in H2 atmosphere. As shown in the polarization curves of OER on the PBSCF NTs (Figure 6a), the potential at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 increased from 1.60 V for the pristine samples to 1.62, 1.63, and 1.63 V (vs RHE) for the ones subjected to 2 h (NT-H-2h), 4 h (NT-H-4h), and 6 h (NT-H-6h) thermal annealing, respectively. The Tafel slopes were also increased from 70 mV dec-1 for the pristine samples to 71, 75, and 78 mV dec-1 for the NT-H-2h, the NT-H4h, and the NT-H-6h, respectively.<|>In contrast to the degraded performance for the thermally annealed PBSCF NTs, the ones subjected to electrochemical reduction showed significantly improved OER activity. The potential at 10 mA cm-2 decreased from 1.60 V for the pristine samples to 1.58, 1.57, and 1.56 V (vs RHE) for the ones subjected to 2 h (NT-V-2h), 4 h (NT-V-4h), and 6 h (NT-V-6h) electrochemical reduction, respectively.

There was little  observable change for P-pristine, P-H-6h, and P-V-20  min in  the potential after chrono potenti o metric test for   $10\\textrm{h}$  , whereas  the potential for   $\\mathrm{{lrO}_{2}}$   showed obvious increase from the original 1.67 to   $1.75\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   after   $^{5\\mathrm{~h~}}$   test (Figure  5g). These results  suggest that both the pristine PBSCF powder and the treated  ones have high stability under the OER condition. Scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) measurement showed that both  thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction induced  negligible changes in the micro structure of the PBSCF powders  (Figure 5h and Figure S17a–f, Supporting Information).  \n\nFor the PBSCF NT with diameters of   ${\\approx}200$    nm, we carried out similar treatment to introduce oxygen vacancies and  evaluate the changes in OER performance as we did for PBSCF  powder.  \n\nThe OER activity of PBSCF NTs was found to degrade  after thermal annealing in   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   atmosphere. As shown in the  polarization curves of OER on the PBSCF NTs ( Figure   6 a), the  potential at the current density of   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   increased from   $1.60\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   for the pristine samples to 1.62, 1.63, and   $1.63\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$  (vs  RHE) for the ones subjected to   $2\\textup{h}$   (NT-H-2h), 4 h (NT-H-4h),  and 6 h (NT-H-6h) thermal annealing, respectively. The Tafel  slopes were also increased from   $70\\ensuremath{~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1}}$   for the pristine  samples to 71, 75, and   $78~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1}$   for the NT-H-2h, the NT-H4h, and the NT-H-6h, respectively.  \n\nIn contrast to the degraded performance for the thermally  annealed PBSCF NTs, the ones subjected to electrochemical  reduction showed significantly\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
