Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

As a thermal-stable layer, the 2D perovskite capping layer can effectively block the iodide ion diffusion from the  3D perovskite film to the HTM and electrode.  With thicker  2D perovskite capping layers   $(8\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$   PEAI), the 2D-3D PSCs  demonstrated even better thermal stability, maintaining nearly   $90\\%$   of the original PCE after   $100\\textrm{h}$   at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . When aging at  an elevated temperature of   $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the 2D-3D PSCs based on  the thin and thick 2D perovskite capping layers still can retain  around 60 and  $70\\%$   of the original PCEs, respectively. This relatively deteriorated thermal stability at higher temperature can  be ascribed to the low glass transition temperature   $(\\leq85\\ \\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  of Spiro-OMeTAD with additives.  We anticipated that the  incorporation of robust inorganic HTMs such as  $\\mathrm{CuSCN}$   would  further improve the thermal stability of 2D-3D PSCs.  \n\n# 3. Conclusions  \n\nIn summary, we report a facile strategy to simultaneously  improve the stability and efficiency of 2D-3D PSCs by introducing a rationally designed 2D   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$   capping layer on top  of the 3D perovskite film. Such capping layer induces larger  Fermi-level splitting and reduces non radiative recombination loss in 2D-3D PSCs, leading to a higher   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and thus an  enhanced PCE. The downward shift of quasi-Fermi level calculated in KPFM results is consistent with the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement  observed in the  $J{\\cdot}V$   measurement. The optimized energy band  alignment and suppressed non radiative recombination with the  incorporation of 2D perovskite capping layer are further verified by the TRPL decay measurements. Moreover, these 2D-3D  stacking layered PSCs showed significantly improved long-term  stability and the majority (nearly   $90\\%$  ) of their original high  efficiency can be retained after exposure in a humid environment for   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$  . Our findings provide an effective strategy to  reduce the voltage losses and address the main hindrance to  the practical application of perovskite devices, which is also  applicable to other perovskite-based op to electronic devices  beyond photovoltaics.  \n\n# 4.
