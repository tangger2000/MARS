Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In clear contrast, the pristine PSCs with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   exhibits  PCE of   $21.46\\%$   with   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of 1.169 V,   $J_{S C}$   of   $23.48\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and  FF of   $78.18\\%$  . In Figure  5b, the integrated current densities  of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for pristine  and pre-buried 3AAH   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   based devices are determined to  be 23.43 and   $23.94\\mathrm{{\\mA}}\\mathrm{{\\cm}}^{-2}$  , respectively, in good agreement  with the   $J{-}V$  measurements. Figure 5c shows the forward and  reverse scan   $J{-}V$   curves of champion f-PSCs with pre-buried  3AAH additives, and the corresponding parameters are given  in Table S3 (Supporting Information). According to the equation   $\\mathrm{HI=(PCE_{FS}\\ \\cdot P C E_{R S})/P C E_{F S}}$  , PSC based on 3AAH ${\\cdot}\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nO}_{2}$    shows a negligible hysteresis index (HI) of   $0.81\\%$  , which is far  lower than that of the original PSC   $(3.08\\%)$  . Figure 5d shows  the steady-state PCE output tracking of the devices for   $200\\ \\mathrm{s}$  .  The pristine PSCs and   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   based f-PSCs show steadystate PCE of   $19.79\\%$   and   $21.79\\%$  , respectively, confirming the  accuracy of the photo current measurements and reliability  of the efficiency. Further, the evolution of normalized PCE  under steady-state and continuous simulated solar illumination   $(100\\mathrm{\\mW\\,cm}^{-2})$  ) is statistically analyzed, and the results are  shown in Figure S13 (Supporting Information). After   $90\\textup{h}$  , the  device based on 3AAH ${\\cdot}\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nO}_{2}$   still maintains the initial PCE of   $92\\%$  . Figure 5e gives the statistical analysis of the f-PSCs performance with 30 devices tested for each condition. The f-PSCs  with pre-buried 3AAH shows a narrower PCE distribution than  that of the control device, demonstrating good reproducibility.  \n\nWe further investigate the mechanical flexibility of f-PSCs  under bending stresses at a bending radius of   $5\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}$  . From  Figure 5f, the devices show outstanding durability upon 3AAH  treatment, maintaining   $84\\%$   of the initial PCE after 4000  bending cycles. Contrast ingly, the pristine device shows only   $30\\%$   of the initial PCE. This could be attributed to the superior  flexibility afforded by the 2D phases, as well as the ameliorated  inter facial characteristic at the ETL/PVK interface. The longterm stability of the devices is also tested, 20 un encapsulated  devices are stored at room temperature   $(25\\ \\mathrm{}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   and   $30\\,\\pm\\,5\\%$    relative humidity (RH). From Figure 5g, the f-PSCs treated with  3AAH show a remarkably improved stability by maintaining   $92\\%$   of the initial PCE after 30 days, which should be attributed to the effect of micro-compressive stress and fewer defects  induced by the 2D phases.  \n\nThe dependence of   $\\mathrm{V_{OC}}$  and   $\\mathrm{J_{SC}}$   of f-PSCs on light intensity \n\n  $\\mathrm{(P_{light})}$   are evaluated in Figure   $^{5\\mathrm{h,i}}$  . According to the equation: \n\n  $\\tilde{V_{\\mathrm{OC}}}\\propto\\langle n k T/q\\rangle$   ln   $(P_{\\mathrm{light}})$  , where   $k$   is Boltzmann constant,   $T$  is  absolute temperature,   $q$   is elementary charge, deviations of the  slope from the unit   $k T/q$   indicate the presence of trap-assisted  recombination in the PSCs.  The slopes of f-PSCs without and  with pre-buried 3AAH additives are determined to be 1.52 and   $1.35\\;k T/q$  , respectively, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination of PSCs is significantly reduced after 3AAH treatment.  In addition, the slope values   $\\alpha$  for the devices without and  with pre-buried 3AAH additives can be calculated from Equation:   $\\alpha\\!=\\!\\ln\\,(J_{S C})/$   ln   $\\left(P_{\\mathrm{light}}\\right)$   as 0.981 and 0.998, respectively. The  increase in   $\\alpha$   indicates less single-molecule recombination in  devices with pre-buried 3AAH. The   $\\alpha$  value of the device based  on   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   is closer to 1 than that based on the pristine   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , which indicates that the charge carriers in the device are  collected by the corresponding electrodes.  \n\nThe charge mobility and trap density within the PSCs  are analyzed using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC)  model based on the ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag structure  of electron-only device (Figure  5j).
