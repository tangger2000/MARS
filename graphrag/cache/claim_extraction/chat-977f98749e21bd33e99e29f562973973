Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

By spin-coating a ph en ethyl ammonium iodide  (PEAI) solution upon the 3D perovskite film, an in situ grown  2D perovskite   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$   layer was formed by the following  reaction of PEAI with excess   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  .  The thicknesses of the  2D perovskite capping layers can be manipulated by varying  the concentration of PEAI solution (1, 4, and   $8\\,\\,\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}\\,\\,\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$   in  iso prop an ol). Unless stated otherwise, all the characterization  results were based on the 2D-3D perovskite films fabricated by   $1~\\mathrm{mg~mL^{-1}}$   PEAI solution. As shown in Figure 1b, the X-ray  diffraction (XRD) pattern of the 3D perovskite films shows the  typical peaks for   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\mathrm{\\mathrm{-}F A P b I}_{3}$   (black perovskite phase) and a pronounced peak at   $12.7^{\\circ}$   indicates the presence of excess   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   in  the crystalline 3D perovskite films.  The crystal structure of  the obtained pristine 2D perovskite films was also investigated  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/65aa7fde51e26993a4e702a51628281f3d518d69fbc913a34cffe4f72211e12b-1723827026.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   a) Schematic illustrations of the crystal structure of 2D-3D perovskite films and the device architecture, b) XRD patterns of the 3D, 2D, and  2D-3D perovskite films, c) calculated UV–vis spectra of the 3D and 2D-3D perovskite films; Top-view SEM image of d) the 3D perovskite film and  e) the 2D-3D perovskite film (the scale bar is  $1~{\\upmu m})$  ).  \n\nand the peaks at   $10.9^{\\circ}$  ,   $16.4^{\\circ}$  ,   $21.8^{\\circ}$  ,   $27.3^{\\circ}$  , and   $32.9^{\\circ}$   can be  assigned to the scattering from (004), (006), (008), (0010),  and (0012) crystal plane of the layered perovskite   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$  ,  respectively.  In the XRD pattern of the 2D-3D perovskite  films, all the featured peaks can be indexed to 3D and 2D  perovskite, respectively, indicating the well-preserved crystallinity in these perovskite stacking layers. The   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peak in the  2D-3D perovskite sample almost disappeared because of the  PEAI post-treatment. To further confirm the presence of   $\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}$  functional groups on the surface, we performed the Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR) spectrum measurement for various  perovskite films (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). The  peaks at 1712, 3267, and   $3400~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   can be assigned to   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{~C=N~}}$  and   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   stretching vibrations from   $\\mathrm{HC(NH_{2})}{=}\\mathrm{NH_{2}}^{+}$     $\\mathrm{(FA^{+})}$  cation, respectively, while the extra peak at   $1567\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   observed  in the 2D-3D sample indicates the aromatic   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=C}}$   stretching  vibration from   $\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}$   cation in 2D perovskite.  \n\nThe optical energy band gaps of 3D and 2D-3D perovskite  films were calculated by applying the Kubelka–Munk method  in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption measurement  (Figure 1c).  The absorption band edges of the as-prepared  3D and 2D-3D perovskite films were calculated to be   $1.6\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  indicating the efficient light absorption from these crystalline  perovskite films. The additional band edge of   $2.3\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   observed  in the 2D-3D perovskite film can be ascribed to the 2D perovskite capping layer.  As indicated in Figure S2b (Supporting  Information), both perovskite films showed emission peaks at   $\\approx\\!762\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   in the photo luminescence (PL) spectra under  $450~\\mathrm{nm}$  light source excitation. Compared to the 3D perovskite film, the  2D-3D perovskite film exhibited an enhanced steady-state emission PL, which was due to the suppressed non radiative recombination loss by 2D perovskite layer.  The morphology change  before and after PEAI treatment was then investigated by SEM.  The pristine 3D perovskite film shown in Figure 1d is compact  and pinhole-free with an average grain size of   ${\\approx}300\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , while  the pure 2D perovskite film is ultra smooth with a larger grain  size of   ${\\approx}1~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   (Figure S3, Supporting Information). After PEAI  treatment, the exposed surfaces of 3D perovskite crystals are  fully covered by the in situ grown 2D perovskite materials as  shown in the top-view SEM image of 2D-3D perovskite films,  serving as a self-encapsulating layer to block the moisture invasion (Figure 1e).  \n\nTo further verify the formation of the 2D perovskite layer, the  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were  carried out on 3D, 2D, and 2D-3D perovskite films. In the C1s  XPS spectrum of 3D perovskite films, the presence of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}/M A^{+}}$  cations can be confirmed by the detected C  C (284.8 eV) and   $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{C=N}$     $(286.5\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   bonds ( Figure   2 a).  For the emerged   $\\mathrm{C=O}$  bond (288.1 eV), we speculate these oxidized carbon species may  come from the decomposition of the 3D perovskite film induced  by the absorption of water or oxygen when exposing to the  ambient condition.  The featured bonds of C  N (400.3 eV)  and  $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{C=N}$     $(402.0\\;\\mathrm{eV})$  ) from the   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   cation can be observed in the  N1s spectrum of 3D perovskite films (Figure 2b). In the C1s  XPS spectrum of the pristine 2D perovskite films, the emerged  peak at a binding energy of   ${\\approx}292.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   can be ascribed to the   $\\pi{-}\\pi$  bonding from the phenyl functional group in the   $\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}$  cation (Figure 2c). Only one peak for   $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{C=N}$     $(402.0\\ \\mathrm{eV})$  ) can be  found in the N1s spectrum of the 2D per\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
