For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized.

TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The as-prepared perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the pristine and modiﬁed   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ﬁlm at 4000 rpm for  $30~\\mathsf{s}.$  , and  $80~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of CB antisolvent was dripped on the perovskite ﬁlm at   $\\updownarrow5\\ s$   before ending the program. The wet perovskite ﬁlms were annealed at   $130~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $30\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$  . The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving   $17.5\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of Li-TFSI solution   $(520~\\mathsf{m g\\;m L^{-1}}$    Li-TFSI in acetonitrile),  $72.3~\\mathrm{mg}$   of Spiro-OMeTAD and  $28.8\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of  t BP in   $1000\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   CB. Subsequently, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on perovskite ﬁlms at 4000 rpm for  $30~\\mathrm{s}$   to prepare hole transport layer. Finally, a   $100\\;\\mathsf{n m\\,A g}$   counter electrode was thermally evaporated on the surface of the Spiro-OMeTAD ﬁlms under a vacuum of  $3\\times\\dot{\\mid}0^{-4}$    Pa by using a shadow mask. For the devices used for the stability test, an  $80\\;\\mathsf{n m\\,A u}$   counter electrode was thermally evaporated.  \n\nCharacterization : UV–vis absorption measurement was performed using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and grazing incidence X-ray diﬀraction (GIXRD) patterns were obtained on a P\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
