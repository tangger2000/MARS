This indicates the timeframe of the research and the availability of the findings to the scientific community.<|>The community has resorted to eliminating trap states on the perovskite surface using organic molecules, or increasing the grain size in poly crystalline films via inter facial engineering. However, these do not address the fundamentally inherent issues associated with GBs within bulk   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$     $(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\;=\\;\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3})$   films. Desorption of  MA is known to occur during thermal annealing due to the low  thermal stability of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   crystals, which causes the formation  of vacancies (under-coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atoms) and   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{I}$   antisite  defects where an iodine atom occupies the   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   site and forms a  trimer with neighboring iodine atoms, as well as decomposition  of the crystal at its GBs.  Based on previous theoretical  modeling and experimental studies, the under-coordinated Pb  atoms and   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{I}$   antisite defects at GBs are the main sources  of the trap states.  Meanwhile, the presence of disordered  MAI at GBs would facilitate permeation of moisture along GBs  which again accelerates trap state formation.  The relatively  deep trap states resulting from the MA loss are expected to form  significant potential wells at GBs for charge carriers and thus  lead to serious trapping, charge accumulation, and recombination.  In this context, GB engineering within the bulk film  can be an effective strategy to passivate defects and improve  the overall device performance, which has been successfully  demonstrated by introducing inert molecules or polymers  which can form hydrogen bonding with perovskite, including  alkyl ph os phonic acid   $\\omega$  -ammonium chlorides,  poly(methyl  meth a cry late),  poly(ethylene glycol),  and poly(vinylpyrro­ lidone).  Recently, the semiconducting molecule fullerene  has proven its merits by eliminating trap states at GBs within  the perovskite film, due to the formation of fullerene-halide  radicals, which eliminates Pb–I antisite defects.  However,  there  is a lack of design rules for identifying even more efficient semiconducting pas siva tors for stable high-performance  devices, likely due to the still poorly understood crystallization  mechanism of the perovskite and the molecular pass iv ation  mechanism. Moreover, pass iv ation of under-coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  defects within the bulk of the film using semiconducting mole­ cules has not been reported yet and is important to explore as  it promises to further improve the op to electronic properties of  poly crystalline perovskite films.  In this work, we introduced semiconducting molecules with  Lewis acid or base functional groups into the sol–gel   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  film, promoting uniform decoration of GBs within the bulk film.  The molecules trigger heterogeneous nucleation and growth of  the crystalline solvate   $(\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{DMSO})$  ) during solution-casting  explored using in situ synchrotron-based grazing incident X-ray  scattering. These crystalline solvates provide frameworks for  the growth of compact films free of significant gaps. The molecules holistic ally passivate under-coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   vacancies  through the formation of Lewis adducts or   $\\mathrm{Pb}{}_{\\mathrm{-I}}$   antisite defects  through the formation of halide-fullerene radical. Importantly,  these semiconducting molecules can better passivate trap states  and provide more efficient intergrain carrier transport when  their energetic levels closely match with the band structure of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  . Poly crystalline thin films thus exhibit significantly  improved op to electronic properties, including enhanced charge  separation at the perovskite–molecule interface, enhanced  charge extraction, reduced trap densities, enhanced hole/ electron mobilities, reduced recombination of charge carriers,  and reduced contact resistance at the perovskite/electrode interfaces. We translate these benefits into significant enhancements  of the PCE as well as improved environmental and thermal  stability of solar cells. The benz odi thi oph ene (BDT) unit based  DR3TBDTT passivated   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   devices reach a PCE of   $19.3\\%$  in planar   $\\mathrm{n{-}i{-}p}$   devices and the bare cells without any encapsulation degrade only   ${\\approx}13\\%$   after   $40\\,\\mathrm{~d~}$  of exposure in   $50\\%$  relative humidity at room temperature, and   ${\\approx}10\\%$   after   $24{\\mathrm{~h~}}$   at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   under controlled environment.

The large number of trap states nevertheless induces charge carrier recombination  and will limit further increase of the PCE  in thin-film solar cells unless they can  be further reduced.  Recent studies  using Kelvin probe force microscopy and  conductive atomic force microscopy show  different electrical potentials between  GBs and bulk crystals  with much faster  ion migration in the former.  Furthermore, the theoretical studies indicate that  chemical composition at GBs terminated  by either the iodide or the ammonium  ion could remarkably influence the optoelectronic properties of film.  Thus,  lowering the charge recombination via  reducing defects states in the perovskite  poly crystalline thin film is crucial for continued progress in device performance.  \n\nThe trap states at grain boundaries (GBs) within poly crystalline perovskite  films deteriorate their op to electronic properties, making GB engineering  particularly important for stable high-performance op to electronic devices. It is  demonstrated that trap states within bulk films can be effectively passivated  by semiconducting molecules with Lewis acid or base functional groups. The  perovskite crystallization kinetics are studied using in situ synchrotron-based  grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to explore the film formation mechanism.  A model of the pass iv ation mechanism is proposed to understand how the  molecules simultaneously passivate the  $\\mathsf{P b}\\!-\\!\\mathsf{I}$   antisite defects and vacancies  created by under-coordinated  $\\sf P b$   atoms. In addition, it also explains how the  energy offset between the semiconducting molecules and the perovskite influences trap states and intergrain carrier transport. The superior op to electronic  properties are attained by optimizing the molecular pass iv ation treatments.  These benefits are translated into significant enhancements of the power conversion efficiencies to  $\\mathbf{19.3\\%},$  , as well as improved environmental and thermal  stability of solar cells. The passivated devices without encapsulation degrade  only by  $\\approx\\!13\\%$   after  $\\bf{40\\,d}$   of exposure in   $50\\%$   relative humidity at room temperature, and only  $\\approx\\!10\\%$   after   $\\mathbf{24}\\,\\mathsf{h}$   at  $\\mathtt{80\\,^{\\circ}C}$   in controlled environment.  \n\nThe community has resorted to eliminating trap states on the perovskite surface  using organic molecules,  or increasing  the grain size in poly crystalline films via  \n\nHybrid organic–inorganic perovskite semiconductors have  attracted intense research interest in the last few years due to  their excellent properties such as high absorption coefficient,   long exciton diffusion length,  and tunable direct bandgap,   making it the leading contender for photovoltaic applications.  Tremendous effort from multiple research groups has propelled  the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite  solar cells to the current world record of   $22.7\\%$  .  However, the  large number of defects at grain boundaries (GBs) within the  poly crystalline perovskite films are unavoidable because of  lowtemperature solution-based preparation processes which are far  from thermodynamic equilibrium. In fact, the defect density  of poly crystalline films is several orders of magnitude higher  \n\ninter facial engineering.
