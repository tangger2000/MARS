Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The SNO nanosheets  were prepared by shaking the TBAOH-containing solution under  room temperature for 10 days, then washed three times with distilled  water and collected by cent ri fuga tion. Before any characterization and  measurement, (TBA)SNO sheets were dispersed on substrates and then  kept under UV exposure to burn out residual  ${\\mathsf{T}}{\\mathsf{B}}{\\mathsf{A}}^{+}$  .  \n\nCharacterization of SNO Samples : The size and morphology of  exfoliated SNO nanosheets were investigated by field-emission SEM  (Zeiss Sigma). The AFM measurement was conducted on a Bruker  Dimension Edge atomic force microscope. High-resolution morphology  and structure of SNO nanosheets were characterized by TEM (JOEL JEM2100F). A Bruker D8-A25 diffract o meter was used for the crystal structure  analysis of powder samples using Cu   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  radiation   $(\\lambda=1.5405\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~})$  ),  while GIXRD was performed for SNO nanosheets on a Rigaku  Smartlab9 diffract o meter. The XPS test was carried out using a PHI  5300 ESCA system   $(\\mathsf{M g},\\ ]4\\ \\mathsf{k V},\\,250\\ \\mathsf{W})$  ). UV–vis spectra were obtained  by measuring dispersed SNO nanosheets on quartz substrate using a  UV–vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900H). The room-temperature  PL and TRPL emission spectra were obtained on an Edinburgh FS5  spec tro flu oro meter. Temperature-dependent PL emission spectra were  measured by a LabRAM HR800 spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon).  \n\nPhotoelectric Measurements : The SNO-based PDs on  $\\mathsf{S i}/\\mathsf{S i O}_{2}$   substrate  were fabricated by photolithography, electron beam deposition of  metal contacts (  $\\mathsf{T S5/50\\ n m\\ C r/A u})$  , and subsequent lift-off process. The  photolithography was conducted on a Heidelberg  $\\upmu\\mathsf{P G}$   501 direct writer  system. After lift-off, fabricated devices were annealed at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  in Ar  atmosphere for  $2~\\mathsf{h}$  . For the construction of flexible SNO PDs, a shadow  mask was used for patterning of   $\\mathsf{C r/A u}$   contacts. All the electric and  photoelectric measurements were conducted using a semiconductor  characterization system (Keithley 4200, USA) and a four-probe station. A  450 W Xenon lamp equipped with a monochromator was utilized as the  light source whose power density was measured with a NOVA II power  meter (OPHIR Photonics). For pulse response characterization, a digital  oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 5140B) and a   $355\\ \\mathsf{n m\\ N d}{\\mathsf{:Y A G}}$   pulsed  laser system with a pulse duration of 3–5 ns were used. Temperaturedependent transport properties were measured using a closed-cycle  helium compressor-cooled cryostat (HC-4E1, Sumitomo).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors appreciate Dr. Weixin Ouyang, Jian Cai, Hong Zhu, and  Yajie Yan for their kind support to this work.
