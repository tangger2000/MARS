Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The  enlarged image is the illustration of  $Z\\mathsf{n{-}B r}$   bond on the surface of QDs after partially substituting the OTAc and DDAB for presenting the comparison  of   $\\mathsf{P b\\mathrm{-}B r}$   by the OIHL pass iv ation. b) FTIR spectra of QDs. c) Statistical   $\\mathsf{O}/\\mathsf{P b}$   and d) statistical   ${\\mathsf{N}}/{\\mathsf{P}}{\\mathsf{b}}$   atomic ratios of calculated from XPS data.  e) High-resolution XPS spectra of QDs. f) Pb 4f XPS spectra of QDs. The spectra were calibrated using C 1s peak. g) Statistical  $\\mathsf{B r/P b}$   atomic ratios of QDs.  \n\nHowever, the XRD spectra were completely coincident for the  QDs before and after the pass iv ation process (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Second, the PL was expected to exhibit a  blueshift when the Zn ion appeared in the crystal lattice,  yet  the PL peak was each located at   $515\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , consistent with that of  primal QDs (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Thus,   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$    appeared as ligands on the QD surface after partially replacing  the long organic ligands. We presumed that the relatively short  treatment time along with the smaller bond dissociation energy  of   $\\mathrm{Zn{-}B r}$     $(138\\,\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}})$  ) compared to   $\\mathrm{Pb\\mathrm{-Br}\\ \\,(314\\k J\\ m o l^{-1})}$    explained  why   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$   molecules did not incorporate into the  perovskite lattice.  \n\nand DDAB, in which OTAc was on the QD surface through the  bonding of   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   with   $\\mathrm{COO^{-}}$  , and DDAB ligands existed on the  surface through the interaction of   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   and tetra-ammonium.  The introduced inorganic pass iv ation is conducted by adding  metal bromide   $(\\mathrm{MBr}_{x})$   to the QD crude solution. Thus, OTAc  and DDAB could be partially replaced with   $\\mathrm{MBr}_{x},$   meaning that  the QDs have fewer and shorter ligands on the surface, which  was expected to enhance the PL and electrical transportation  properties.  \n\nTaking   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$   as an example, the QDs after being passivated  via the OIHL process showed fewer long organic ligands first  confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. QD  films revealed that the characteristic   $_{\\mathrm{C-H}}$   stretching modes   $(2700{-}3000\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-1})$  ) were severely weakened after adding the  inorganic ligands (Figure 1b), displaying long organic ligands  partially replaced by   $Z\\mathrm{nBr}_{2}$  . After pass iv ation, the O content  indicated by the XPS results (Figure 1c) declined drastically  from 3.4 (QDs) to 1.3   $(\\mathrm{QDs}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2})$   by the O and   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atom ratio.  Findings also demonstrated that most OTAc was replaced by   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$  , because the O element only existed in the OTAc. Thus,  a clear reduction in the O content indicated that the organic  ligand OTAc had been largely replaced. Similarly, the  $_\\mathrm{N}$   content  from the DDAB was also reduced (Figure 1d), confirming the  DDAB had also been replaced by   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$  . However, the degree  of substitution was relatively small compared to the drastic  reduction in O content. These results indicated the remaining  OTAc and DDAB were bonded on the QD’s surface after the  OIHL pass iv ation process.  \n\nWe further performed XPS analysis to unveil the organic– inorganic ligands on the QD surface. First, the Pb 4f XPS  spectra shifted toward a higher binding energy (BE) of   $0.2~\\mathrm{eV}$    for QDs-OIHL in reference to QDs (Figure 1f; Figure S3, Supporting Information). Pb atoms in the QDs were assumed to  exist in two chemical environments (e.g., higher and lower  BE regions for   $\\mathrm{Pb{-Br}}$   and Pb  octanoate, respectively) based  on the QD model proposed by De Roo et  al.  The higher  BE shift of the Pb 4f spectrum in QDs-OIHL manifested an  increase in   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}B r}$  species compared to QDs as demonstrated  by peak fitting. Consequently, the Br content increased after  being passivated as measured by quantitative XPS analysis  (Figure 1g). The QDs showed a marginally cation-rich composition   $(\\mathrm{Cs};\\mathrm{Pb};\\mathrm{Br}\\ =\\ 1.0;1.01;2.94)$  . For passivated QDs,  however, the composition became slightly bromide-rich   $\\mathrm{(Cs;Pb;Br=1.0;1.03;3.45}$  ). Thus, we hypothesized that   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$    was bonded on the QDs by the   $\\mathrm{Br\\mathrm{-}Z n\\mathrm{-}B r}$   bonds as illustrated  in Figure 1. Based on the above analysis, the QDs were passivated by organic–inorganic hybrid ligands.  \n\nThe inorganic ligands on the surface of QDs were confirmed  by XPS results, which were observed by appearance of   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   element on the QDs (Figure 1e). We speculated   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$   as a surface  ligand based on the following reasons. First, the X-ray diffraction  (XRD) peak was expected to shift toward higher degrees when  the Zn ion was incorporated into the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   crystal lattice.  \n\nThe micro structure of the primal and OIHL-passivated QDs  was analyzed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM)  as shown in  Figure   2 a,b. Both samples were cube shape with  \n\nan average size of   $8\\pm1.5\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , and the mono­ clinic-phase perovskite was confirmed by  XRD (Figure S1, Supporting Information).  Meanwhile, the absorbance and PL peaks of  the QDs and OIHL-passivated QDs exhibited almost no changes (Figure S2, Supporting Information). These results indicate  that the QDs passivated by OIHL demon­ strated nearly the same morphology as  primal QDs. Although the long organic  ligands were partially replaced by   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$  ,  the remaining organic ligands created QDs  with excellent ink dispersion (Figure 2c).  Thus, high-quality QD films can be obtained  by spin-coating their QD ink. Atomic force  microscopy (AFM) images (Figure 2d,e)  of the QD films showed dense, uniform,  crack-free morphology and a smooth surface  (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The  root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values  are 2.7 and  $3.3\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   for primal- and OIHL-passivated QD films, respectively. A negligible  increase in roughness after   $\\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$   incorporation indicates that OIHL pass iv ation would  not destroy the flatness of the QD films.
