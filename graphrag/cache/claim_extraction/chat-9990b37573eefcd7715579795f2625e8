Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The surface potential is found to be light-wavelengthdependent.  As displayed in Figure 4b, the surface potential  steadily increases from 134.84, 199.24, 264.22 to   $325.13\\,\\mathrm{\\mV}$  when the wavelength of light illumination located at 660, 520,  450, and  $365\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , respectively. It is worth noting that the Bruker  Dimension Icon AFM which is used for the KPFM measurement is equipped with  $670\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   laser. Therefore, slight shiftment  might be generated in the measured potential. In general, the  increase of surface potential is stemmed from the aggregation  of holes or loss of electrons.  As mentioned before, light illumination on the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs film can trigger generation of  photo carriers. The photo generated holes can easily escape from  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   to pentacene through a bending of energy band  and thus leaving behind photoinduced electrons in the conduction band of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   which induces an abrupt increase of  surface potential.  \n\nTo further confirm the hypothesis, the trapping capacity of  electrons and holes was evaluated separately.  Two   $1\\,\\times\\,1\\,\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$  areas of the perovskite film were scanned at   $+6$   and   $-6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   to  inject holes and electrons along the horizontal direction  (Figure 4d). The dynamic variation process of the charge transport was recorded with a time-accelerated mode, and several  snapshots of the surface potential are shown in Figure 4e. The  bright region indicates the electron-trapping state, and the dark  region corresponds to the hole-trapping state.  The contrast  change of the hole injected area was completely different  from the electron injected area, with a quicker vanish speed,  indicating a fast drift speed of the injected holes through the  perovskite layer. Compared with the initial state after the charge  injection in the upper panel of Figure 4e, the surface potential  only exhibited  ${\\approx}30\\%$   variation after   $3\\mathrm{~h~}$   for the electron injected  area, while   ${\\approx}74\\%$   reduction is estimated for the  hole injected  area.  The deeply trapped electrons give evidence to the lightinduced synapse properties of the device and the persistence  of the photonic memory.  Consequently, KPFM results  obtained from charge trapping operations strongly support our  hypothesis that the photonic synapse behavior of our device  originates from the electron trapping ability of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    QDs layer.  \n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs-based photonic memory and its implementation of synaptic  functions. By employing the type II he t ero structure of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs and pentacene which is capable of restricting the photogenerated electrons, the photonic memory device exhibits lightinduced charge trapping and electrical-mediated charge release  characteristics, allowing optical programming operation and  electrical erasing operation at device level.  In addition, SRDP,  STP, and LTP modulated by the optical way were elucidated to  emulate the synaptic connection rule in the human brain. The  photonic potenti ation and electrical habituation were successfully emulated.  KPFM is used to visualize the redistribution  charge induced by the photonic stimulation. These results shift  the paradigm in photonic synapse as serving in terms of performance and understanding, which remain challenging in this  community.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe  authors  acknowledge  the  grants  from  Natural  Science  Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61601305 and 61604097), the  Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen  (Grant  Nos.  JCYJ20170302145229928,  JCYJ20170302151653768,  JCYJ20170818143618288,  KQJSCX20170727100433270,  and  KQJSCX20170327150812967),  Guangdong  Provincial  Department  of Science and Technology (Grant Nos. 2018 B 030306028 and  2017 A 010103026), the Department of Education of Guangdong Province  (Grant Nos. 2015 K Q NC X 141 and 2016 KTS CX 120), NTUT-SZU Joint  Research Program (Grant No. 2018007), and the Natural Science  Foundation of SZU.  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ncharge trapping, flash memory, perovskite, photonic synapse, quantum  dots  \n\nReceived: May 5, 2018 Revised: June 21, 2018 Published online:  \n\n[1]\t S. Mani pat run i, D. E. Nikonov, I. A. Young,  Nat. Phys.   2018 ,  14 , 338.\n\n [2]\t C. Liu, X. Yan, X. Song, S. Ding, D. W. Zhang, P. Zhou,  Nat. Nano- technol.   2018 ,  13 , 404.\n\n [3]\t\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
