Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

It further demonstrates that the  pre-buried 3AAH has positive effect on the crystallographic orientation of PVK.  \n\nTo study the mechanical properties of PVK films with/ without pre-buried 3AAH in   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  , Peak Force Quantitative  Nano mechanical Mapping (PFQNM) is carried out.  From  Figure  3d, the averaged Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT)  \n\nmodulus of 3AAH $\\mathrm{\\cdotSnO_{2}/P V K}$   film is determined to be   $2.89\\,\\mathrm{\\GPa}$  , lower than that of pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$     $(4.56\\,\\mathrm{\\DeltaGPa})$  ,  predicting a higher mechanical flexibility of 3AAH $.\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$    film. It might be due to the 2D phases formed in   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  ,  which affords improved bend ability to the hybrid 2D/3D films.  \n\nTo understand the effect of different ETLs on the exciton  dynamics of the PVK films, femtosecond transient absorption  spectroscopy (TAS) tests are performed using a   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   pump  laser to excite the films.  Figure   4 a,b show the 2D pseudo-color  plots of the TA spectra of the PVK films on different ETLs.  For both samples, the presence of the negative   $(\\Delta\\mathsf{A}\\!\\!<\\!\\!0)$   photo bleaching (PB) peak at the band edge position   $(805\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   is  observed. This is due to carrier state-filling at the band edge  resulting in the ground-state bleaching (GSB).  Compared  to pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$  , 3AAH $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2/}$  /PVK exhibits a smaller PB  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/eca1e20b68d3321ad2514851305af68be8bf6c96a8a7e23fb4c9bd1e44a32a09-1727105352.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   TA mapping of a) pristine  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/\\mathsf{P V K}$   and b)  $3\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{H}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{S}\\mathsf{n O}_{2}/\\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{K}$  , TA spectra at different delay times of the c) pristine   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/\\mathsf{P V K}$   and d) 3AAH $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/\\mathsf{P V K}$   under front excitation, Steady-state PL spectra of e) pristine   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/\\mathsf{P V K}$   and f) 3AAH $\\cdot\\mathsf{S n O}_{2I}$  /PVK films.  \n\npeak FWHM of  $61.6\\;\\mathrm{meV}.$   The decrease in FWHM indicates the  suppression of the number of background carriers. Due to Coulomb blocking effect, unpaired carriers will reduce the band  gap oscillation. Furthermore, a double exponential decay function   $\\mathrm{y}=\\mathrm{y}_{0}+\\mathrm{A}_{1}\\,\\exp[{\\cdot}(\\mathrm{x}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{x}_{0})/\\tau_{1}]+\\mathrm{A}_{2}\\,\\exp[{\\cdot}(\\mathrm{x}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{x}_{0})/\\tau_{2}]$   is used to fit  the exciton lifetime of the TA spectra,  the decay character istics are shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), and the  relevant parameters are summarized in Table  S1 (Supporting  Information). The fast process   $(\\tau_{1})$   can be assigned to the hot  polaron cooling process.  By fitting, the hot carrier cooling  rate of 3AAH $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$   is obviously slowed down, with   $\\tau_{1}$    elongating from 82.43 to 207 .23 ps, which can effectively reduce  the energy loss. The long lifetime   $(\\tau_{2})$   can be attributed to  band edge exciton recombination.  3AAH $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$   shows  a longer   $\\tau_{2}$     $(1783.73~\\mathrm{ps})$  , indicating that the density of surface  defect states in the PVK film is reduced and the non radiative  recombination loss is suppressed. Smaller FWHM and longer   $\\tau$  are beneficial to improve the performance of PSCs.  \n\nTo have an in-depth understanding of 3AAH doping in ETL  on affecting the trap states both within the bulk PVK and at  the interface, photo luminescence (PL) measurement is performed.  The PL spectra of ETL/PVK films have been tested  with   $475\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   incident light excited from the bottom side and  top side, respectively. As shown in Figure  4e, the PL peak of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P V K}$   measured from both sides shows similar intensity, indicating that the two surfaces have similar qualities. In  contrast, for   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{PVK}$  , the PL signal from bottom is  much stronger than that from the top, which implies that the  non radiative recombination of PVK bottom interface is obviously suppressed. And the PL peak experiences a remarkable  blue-shifted from  $794\\,\\mathrm{nm}$     $(\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{PVK})}}$   to   $789\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   (3AAH  $\\cdot\\mathrm{5nO_{2}/}$  PVK), indicating reduced in-gap trap states in the PVK film  with 2D phase pass iv ation.  \n\nTo evaluate the effect of pre-buried 3AAH on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, the f-PSCs with device structure  of PEN/ITO/ETL/Perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag are fabricated  and tested under simulated 1 sun illumination at an intensity of   $100\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}(A M\\1.5}$   spectrum). In addition to 3AAH,  4AAH and 5AAH with different carbon chain length are incorporated into   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   for comparison. The molecular structures of  3AAH, 4AAH and 5AAH are shown in Figure S9 (Supporting  Information). Through concentration optimization (Figure S10  and Table  S2, Supporting Information),   $J{-}V$  characteristics of  the champion f-PSCs using different additives are studied in  Figure   5 a, and the corresponding parameters are summarized  in  Table    1 . It is found that   $J_{S C}$  shows an obvious decreased  trend with increasing the carbon chain, which should be due to  the larger charge transfer resistance through the longer carbon  chain. The PSC device with pre-buried 3AAH additive in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  achieves the highest photovoltaic performance with a record  PCE of   $23.36\\%$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of 1.187 V,  $J_{S C}$   of   $24.45\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and FF of   $80.47\\%$  . In clear contrast, the pristine PSCs with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   exhibits  PCE of   $21.46\\%$   with   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of 1.169 V,   $J_{S C}$   of   $23.48\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and  FF of   $78.18\\%$  .
