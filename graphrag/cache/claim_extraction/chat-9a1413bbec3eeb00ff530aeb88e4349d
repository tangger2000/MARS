Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Inset of panel b): stabilized power output  (SPO) from various devices. The SPO data were collected at a constant voltage (0.71 and   $0.79~\\mathrm{V}$   for  $\\mathsf{C l8-C s P b l}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{C8}/\\mathsf{C1}\\,\\mathrm{8}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b}\\vert_{3}$  -based devices,  respectively) during continuous illumination (1 sun).  \n\namount of  $\\mathsf{C l2-C s P b l}_{3}$   was dispersed in hexane and remained stable for  several days.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : A compact  $\\cdot\\dag{\\bf i}{\\bf O}_{2}$     $(\\mathsf{c}\\!-\\!\\mathsf{T i O}_{2})$   layer with   $50\\ \\mathrm{~\\textmu~}\\mathtt{n m}$  thickness was deposited on precleaned FTO substrates   $(]2\\,\\,\\,{\\Omega}\\,\\,\\,{\\mathfrak{s q}}^{-1})$  using a solution of  ${\\sf T i C I}_{4}$   in deionized water   $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\M})$   at  $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\sf{T h}$  . The \n\n  $\\mathsf{c}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  -coated substrates were annealed at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $\\sf{T h}$  . The as-prepared \n\n  $\\mathsf{C8}/\\mathsf{C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b}|_{3}$   QDs (dispersed in octane) were kept in darkness at   $4\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $48~\\mathsf{h}$   before use. Aged QDs with   $\\mathsf{\\Gamma}_{\\approx70\\ m g\\ m L^{-1}}$   concentration  were spin-coated on the   $\\mathsf{c}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  -coated substrates at 1000 rpm for   $\\;10\\textsf{s}$  ,  followed by spinning at 2000  rpm for   $20~s$  . The spin-coating process  was repeated two to four times to produce a   $200{-}300~\\mathsf{n m}$   thick film of  QDs. Thereafter, a saturated MeOAc-spiro-OMeTAD solution (doped  with Li-TFSI and 4- tert -but yl pyr i dine) was used as the hole transport  material;  this was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for  $30~\\mathrm{s}$  . Finally, an  ${\\approx}80\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  thick Au film was deposited as an electrode by evaporation.  \n\nCharacterization : The crystal structures and micro structures of the   $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{3}$   QDs were examined using XRD with   $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K o}$  radiation (Bruker  D8 Advance powder X-ray diffract o meter) and TEM (JEM-3100, JEOL,  Japan). The optical properties of the   $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{3}$   QDs were recorded  with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary60, Agilent) during excitation  with a   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   laser (RF-5301  PC, Shimadzu, Japan). The PLQY was  examined with a Hamamatsu C11347-12 Quantaurus-QY fluorescence  spectrometer. The TRPL lifetime was collected with a fluorescence  spectrometer (FLS 980) while using a   $507\\ \\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   laser for excitation  (EPL-510, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.). All the samples were stored  in sealed flasks under dark conditions in air at room temperature with  a humidity of   $45–55\\%$   to examine their st abilities. The photo current  density–voltage   $(J-V)$   curves of the as-fabricated solar cells were  recorded with a Keithley 2400 semiconductor characterization  system (Keithley Instruments, USA) during illumination with a solar  simulator (Newport 91160, 300 W xenon lamp, USA), which employed  a mono crystalline silicon cell system (Oriel, USA) as a reference to  calibrate the output light intensity. The SPO data were measured at a  constant voltage corresponding to the voltage at the highest PCE value  in the   $J^{-V}$  curve (0.71 and   $0.79~\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
