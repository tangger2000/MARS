Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Apparently, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor film exhibited  stronger PL in entire area than the GOS scintilla tor film so it  is expected that the new PNCs will have better emission under  irradiation of X-ray than the conventional GOS scintilla tor.  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor was synthesized by solution  chemistry  and its transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  image was shown in Figure 1d. This indicates that the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  PNCs are cubic or bar shape, an average size of   $9\\,\\pm\\,1.5\\,\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  ,  and mono dispersed. The inset is a magnified TEM image of  single PNC confirming that it has a cubic crystalline structure  exposing   $\\{100\\}$   facet. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in  Figure 1e exhibited the peak at   $14.38^{\\circ}$  ,   $20.58^{\\circ}$  ,   $29.92^{\\circ}$  ,   $33.56^{\\circ}$  , \n\n  $37.18^{\\circ}$  , and   $43.22^{\\circ}$   corresponded to (100), (110), (200), (210), \n\n (211), and (220) crystal planes of cubic crystal structure.  \n\nTo compare the emission (scintillation) properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  PNCs and GOS scintilla tor, we checked static PL and dynamic  PL as shown in Figure 1f,g. The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor  film exhibited a strong single PL peak at  ${\\approx}550\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , whereas the  GOS scintilla tor film had multiple PL peaks between 370 and   $630\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   wavelength (maximum at   $544\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) due to multiple  down-conversion by Tb-doping states. To compare the time  resolution of both scintilla tors, we measured the time-resolved  PL (TRPL) spectra as shown in Figure 1g because it is very  important to reduce X-ray radiation dose/poisoning to patients  as small as possible. The   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor had much  faster decay than the conventional GOS scintilla tor. From fitting with bi-exponential function, we can obtain that the PNCs  scintilla tor has an average PL lifetime   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}})$   of 2.87 ns (  $(48.24\\%$  of 0.46 ns and   $51.76\\%$   of 5.28 ns lifetime) and the GOS one  has   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}}$   of 15.99 ns   $(25.48\\%$   of 5.94 ns and   $74.52\\%$   of 26.03 ns  lifetime). This implies that the new PNCs scintilla tor can reduce  the X-ray radiation dose to patients significantly compared with  conventional GOS one. Also, we compared the response times  of both scintilla tors by using a mechanical chopper under illumination of   $285~\\mathrm{nm}~\\mathrm{UV}$   as shown in Figure 1h. The response  time of mechanical chopper (Si-PD),   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs, and GOS  scintilla tor was   ${\\approx}20\\$  , 200, 1200 ns, respectively, which is well  matched with the TRPL results.  \n\nTo compare the performance of both scintilla tors with  respect to X-ray, we used two kinds of X-ray generators. One  is a continuous X-ray generator assembled by tungsten source  (Apogee 5500 series-part #93 501, Oxford instruments), which  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/3c2b36d02a6a7eb1a799161c7bdbe919e24f7e7413a7354eb2c3e3741efce2d4-1727118144.jpg)  \nFigure 2.  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and conventional GOS scintilla tors for X-ray imaging. a) X-ray absorption and X-ray absorption  efficiency of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and conventional GOS scintilla tors, b) light output power density and conversion efficiency of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and conventional GOS scintilla tors, c) analog-to-digital converted values of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and GOS scintilla tor based X-ray detectors with X-ray dose rate, and  d) MTF of pristine Si-PD,   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and conventional GOS scintilla tors based   $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray detector.  \n\nis operating in the range of   $10{-}50\\,\\mathrm{~kV~}$   and max anode current of   $1~\\mathrm{mA}$  . The dose rate range could be varied from 30 to   $550~\\upmu\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   by adjusting anode current and its value could  be measured with multifunction meter (Magicmax Rad, Daol).   $\\mathrm{\\langleGy_{air}=}$   the absorption of 1 J of X-rays radiation energy per   $\\mathrm{kg}$  of matter in atmosphere.) The other is commercialized X-ray  generator for dental clinic (orthoceph-oc-100, In strum eta rium  Dental). To measure the X-ray absorption of the two scintillators, we placed the scintilla tor on a multifunction meter and  measured the X-ray dose values. The absorbed amount of  the scintilla tor was calculated by using the measured dose  value without the scintilla tor as shown in  Figure   2 a. Although  the mass attenuation value of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   was slightly lower than  the GOS at   $50~\\mathrm{kVp}$   (as shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information),  the X-ray absorptivity of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintillator was higher than the GOS scintilla tor at   $50\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{kVp}}$   tube  voltage because the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   scintilla tor   $(1.62\\ \\mathrm{mm})$   is thicker  than GOS scintilla tor   $.0.25\\,\\mathrm{\\mm})$  ), as shown in Figure S3 in  the Supporting Information. It should be noted that thinner   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   scintilla tor film with similar X-ray absorptivity with the  GOS film also can be made by adjusting concentration of PNCs  in PMMA matrix. Accordingly, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor  exhibited the higher X-ray absorption efficiency than GOS scintillator.
