Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Na-ion conduct iv i ties, on the order of   $10^{-6}\\;\\mathrm{S}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , have  also been reported for this material class.  These ionic mobility  values are rather high, especially when compared to many of  the existing solid-state electrolytes (FigureÂ  2b), and therefore,  HEOs might show promise for use in all-solid-state battery  cells.  From a series of controlled experiments, it has been  deduced that alkali ions   $\\mathrm{(Li^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  ) likely move through the  \n\noxygen vacancies that are created in the R-HEO lattice upon  their incorporation.  These ionic conduct iv i ties are also much  larger than the electronic one   $\\scriptstyle(\\approx10^{-9}\\mathrm{~S~}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  , opening up the  possibility to use R-HEOs as pure ionic conductors, as the  leakage current will be negligible.  \n\nThe aforementioned results on the Li-ion conductivity of  R-HEOs motivated subsequent studies regarding their performance in Li-ion battery cells.  It can be seen that the R-HEO  shows promising long-term cycling stability (over 900 cycles),  with specific capacities  ${>}650~\\mathrm{mArh}~\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$   and Coulombic efficiencies   ${\\tt>}99.5\\%$   at a specific current of   $200\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{g}^{-1}$   (FigureÂ 2c)   despite the use of micrometer-sized particles. Moreover, Qiu  etÂ al. reported an increase in specific capacity to   ${>}900\\ \\mathrm{mArh\\g^{-1}}$  for more than 300 cycles (FigureÂ 2d) when using R-HEO with  nanometer-sized particles.  R-HEO with micrometer-sized particles revealed a rate capability behavior with complete capacity  recovery, even after cycling at high specific currents.  Qiu etÂ al.  showed that decreasing the particle size clearly improves the rate  performance (FigureÂ 2e); the cells delivered large specific capacities of about   $490\\ \\mathrm{mArh\\g^{-1}}$   at a specific current of   $3000\\ \\mathrm{mA\\g^{-1}}$  ,  with capacity recovery to  ${\\approx}1000\\;\\mathrm{mArh\\,g}^{-1}$   at   $100\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\:\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$  .  These  results demonstrate that even higher specific capacities can be  achieved upon further optimization in terms of particle size,  electrolyte, binder, etc. The voltage profiles of R-HEO are indicative of a conversion type reaction, with virtually linear voltage  decay over the entire potential range after the first cycle.  \n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, an entropy-mediated  phase-stabilization effect is known for R-HEOs.  A profound effect of entropy on the electrochemical characteristics  of R-HEO has been observed, too.  By extracting one of the  present cations from the R-HEO the entropy decreases from   $1.61\\,\\mathrm{~R~}$   to   $1.39\\,\\mathrm{~R~}$  , as explained in SectionÂ 2.3., and the electrochemical characteristics are significantly altered ( Figure Â   3 ).  Evidently, the R-HEO exhibits much improved capacity retention over the first 100 cycles compared to the R-MEO(-X)  compounds, thus indicating that the transition to medium  entropy compounds results in significant performance decay  (FigureÂ 3a). This finding leads us to the conclusion that entropy  stabilization possibly plays an important role in achieving  a stable conversion reaction mechanism.  The Coulombic  efficiencies corroborate this interpretation by showing the  highest values for R-HEO.  A complete cell failure within  approximately ten cycles is observed for R-MEO(-Co), indicating  the importance of Co in the system (FigureÂ 3a). The significance  of certain elements, like Co and Mg, to achieve stable cycling  performance has also been observed by Qiu etÂ al.  The extraction of constituent cations leads to completely different effects  on the electrochemical behavior. For example, a much lower lithiation potential is found when Cu is removed from the R-HEO  (FigureÂ 3b), while a two-step oxidation with del it hi ation is seen  when   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   is absent.  Such element specific behavior may help  to design or tailor electrode materials to specific user needs.  \n\nThe stable cycling behavior of R-HEO observed for both  micrometer- and nanometer-sized particles is in fact interesting. During the course of the initial lithiation, the XRD  reflections of R-HEO vanished ( Figure Â  4 a), thus indicating an  X-ray amorphous structure after the first half-cycle. However,  no other reflections (from secondary phases) or reappearance of  the initial reflections, even after subsequent del it hi ation, were  observed. This behavior is typical of conversion electrode materials and can be explained by formation of very small and highly  defective crystal lites, whose sizes are often below the coherence  length of X-rays. Using SAED, a rock-salt structure was clearly  identified, even at the fully lithiated state, where only   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   and  corresponding metals should be present (FigureÂ  4a). Upon  subsequent del it hi ation the rock-salt structure could still be  observed.  The corresponding STEMâEDX elemental distribution maps demonstrate the homogeneity (no element segrega- tion) of R-HEO after one complete cycle (FigureÂ  4b). This in  turn demonstrates the possibility of preserving a stable R-HEO  host matrix during the entire conversion process, facilitating  reintegration of metal cations in the del it hi ation cycle.   Additionally, SAED rings after the first lithiation indicate the  presence of   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  , thereby supporting the assumption of a conversion-based reaction during cycling operation (FigureÂ  4c).  The host rock-salt structure of R-HEO can still be identified  after ten cycles from the SAED pattern shown in FigureÂ 4d. The  as-synthesized R-HEO (FigureÂ 1e) shows a well-defined lattice,  while a defective structure is evident after ten cycles (indicated  by red circles in FigureÂ 4e). Consequently, an entropy-stabilized  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/9d6cf43db334bad0a09e0183de81592f576d393134ced2d6f1ae11f1c9ad0b3e-1727122603.jpg)  \nFigure 3. â a) Specific capacity over 100 cycles and b) the first lithiation profiles of different compounds. a,b) Reproduced under the terms of the CC-BY  4.0 license (http://creative commons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

In the case  reported by Qiu etÂ al., similar observations were made.  The  SAED pattern in the inset of FigureÂ 4f shows that the R-HEO  undergoes crystal lin it y deterioration upon cycling, but small  crystalline domains can still be identified after 300 cycles.  \n\nThe formation of secondary phases (metal or metal oxides) was  not observed in both studies. The presence of a âstableâ host  lattice (probably inactive MgO) and sluggish diffusion effects  were assumed by Qiu etÂ al. to be the reasons for the structural  integrity and the stable cycling performance.  Hence, both  studies independently point toward a very similar reaction  mechanism, where some of the constituent\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
