Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

To grow an additional 2D perovskite layer,   $100~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$    of PEAI solution dissolved in iso prop an ol with different concentrations  (1, 4, and   $8\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$  ) were further spin-coated on the as-prepared 3D  perovskite substrates at   $5000\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for   $30\\,\\mathrm{~s~}$  , and annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$    for   $10\\ m i n$  . Subsequently,   $70~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   of Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spincoated on the perovskite layers at 4000 rpm for   $20~\\mathrm{s}$  . Finally, the devices  were completed by depositing   $80\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   of gold electrodes using thermal  evaporation.  \n\nCharacterizations and Measurements : XRD data were obtained from  a Bruker Advanced X-ray diffract o meter (  $.40~\\mathrm{kV}$   and   $30~\\mathsf{m A},$  ) with  $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K o}$  radiation. UV–vis absorption spectra of deposited films were measured  by a spectrophotometer (V-650, Jasco). The functional groups of the  films were characterized by an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet 5700  FTIR) with an ATR accessory. The chemical composition of films was  measured by XPS (Kratos Ultra) with Al   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  radiation source, and all the  binding energies were calibrated by using C 1s   $(284.8\\,\\mathsf{e V})$   as a reference.  The surface and cross-section morphology of deposited films were  recorded using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM,  JEOL 7001). PL spectra and time-resolved fluorescence emission  spectra were measured at room temperature on a fluorescence  spectrophotometer (FLSP-900, Edinburgh Instruments). The steadystate PL emissions were measured at   $450\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   light source excitation  using mono chroma ti zed Xe lamp, while the time-resolved PL decays  were carried out with a   $377\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   pulsed diode laser excitation source.  The 3D topographic images, surface roughness, and CPD of deposited  films were characterized by an AFM (Asylum Research MFP-3D) with  a Pt-coated conductive cantilever probe for KPFM technique. The   $J^{-V}$    curves were measured with a source meter (Keithley 2420) using a  solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class AAA, 94063A) at   $100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$    illumination   $(\\mathsf{A M}\\,\\mathrm{~\\r~{~l~}~}.5\\,\\mathsf{~G})$   equipped with a calibrated silicon reference   $J-V$  curves  were measured in reverse scan (from 1.2 to   $-0.1$   V) or forward scan  (from  $-0.1$   to 1.2 V) modes at a scan speed of   $100\\ \\mathsf{m V\\ s^{-1}}$  . The active  area of devices was defined by a metal shadow mask of  $0.165\\ {\\mathsf{c m}}^{2}$  . The  incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured  using a 300 W xenon light source (Newport, 66902) with an Oriel  Cornerstone monochromator and a multimeter in DC mode. A  standard Si reference cell was used for calibration before the IPCE  measurements.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe financial support from the Australian Research Council Discovery  Projects (ARC DPs), Future Fellowship (FT), and UQ Development  Fellowship programs are highly appreciated.
