Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The resulting  precipitates were centrifuged and washed using DI water and ethanol  several times, and then dried for   $24~\\mathsf{h}$   at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   in a vacuum oven. The  collected powders were milled and heat-treated in   $750~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\mathsf{T}2\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathsf{h}$  . The  sample having equimolar transition metal sulfates is designated as  L5M. The concentration of each transition metal sulfate was doubled  to obtain samples L5M2Ni, L5M2Co, L5M2Fe, L5M2Mn, and L5M2Cr,  where 2 M  (  $\\mathsf{\\Delta}M=\\mathsf{N i}$  , Co, Fe, Mn, and Co) depicts the metal whose sulfate  concentration was doubled. Single perovskite oxides including,   $\\mathsf{L a C r O}_{3}$     $\\mathsf{L a M n O}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathsf{L a F e O}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathsf{L a C o O}_{3}$  , and   ${\\mathsf{L}}{\\mathsf{a}}{\\mathsf{N}}{\\mathsf{i}}{\\mathsf{O}}_{3}$   were synthesized using the same  protocol for comparison.  \n\nCrystalline structure was examined using XRD (Bruker D8  Discover). Morphology was examined using SEM (JEOL 6701F) and  TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F). Micro structure was studied using HRTEM  and SAED analyses. Dark field STEM coupled with energy-dispersive  X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used for elements mapping. Chemical  composition was examined using ICP-MS (ICP-MS, Thermo-Element  XR). XPS (Versa Probe PHI 5000) was used for analyzing the surface  chemistry.  \n\nElectrochemical properties were evaluated using a Metrohm Autolab  instrument in a 3-electrode cell at room temperature. Ni foam was  use as the supported substrate. Before use, Ni foam was cleaned with   $3\\textsf{M}\\mathsf{H C I}$   to remove the oxidized layer, and then washed several times with  ethanol and DI water, and dried in a vacuum oven. The working electrode  was prepared by first mixing   $5~\\mathsf{m g}$   of active material,   $340~\\upmu\\mathrm{I}~\\mathsf{D}1$   water,   $150~\\upmu$   ethanol, and   $40~\\upmu|$  nafion. The mixture was subsequently sonicated  for at least   $\\sf{l}~\\sf{h}$   in order to obtain homogeneous slurry. After that,   $250~\\upmu\\mathrm{I}$  of the resulting slurry was drop casted onto a nickel foam substrate  uniformly, covering an area of  $\\mathsf{I c m}\\times\\mathsf{I c m}$  , and then dried in the vacuum  oven for  $\\sf{T h}$  . An electrode using commercial   $\\mathsf{R u O}_{2}$   was also prepared for  comparison. LSV was carried out at a scanning rate of   $5\\ \\mathsf{m V}\\ \\mathsf{s}^{-1}$   with  a reference electrode of   $\\mathsf{A g}/\\mathsf{A g C I}$   and a counter electrode of platinum.  The potential was converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE),  that is,   $E_{\\mathsf{R H E}}=E_{\\mathsf{A g/A g C I}}+0.059^{\\ast}\\mathsf{p H}+0.1976$   (V). Tafel slope was derived  from the LSV curve in the kinetic controlled region. To measure the  $C_{\\sf d I}$  for estimating the ECSA, CV was performed at various scan rates of 20,  40, 60, 80, 100, and   $120\\ m\\lor\\mathsf{s}^{-1}$   with a non-Faradic window of 1.012 to  1.092 V versus RHE. The   $C_{\\sf d I}$   was determined from the slope of the linear  curve of  $\\Delta{J}$     $(J_{a}-J_{\\mathsf{c}})/2$   at 1.052 V versus the scan rates. ECSA was then  calculated as follows:  $\\mathsf{E C S A}=C_{\\mathsf{d i}}/C_{s}$  , where  $C_{s}$   is the specific capacitance   $(0.04\\ m\\mathsf{F}\\ c m^{-2})$  ).  EIS analysis was performed with a frequency range  from   $10^{5}$   to   $0.05~\\mathsf{H}z$   at an AC amplitude of   $5\\ \\mathsf{m V}.$   Electrochemical data  were corrected with   $95\\%$   IR compensation. The stability was examined  using chrono potenti ome try at a constant current density of   $10\\mathrm{\\mA\\c m}^{-2}$  for  $50~\\mathsf{h}$  . The TOF was calculated at the over potential of   $400~\\mathsf{m V}$  as the  follow equation:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{T O F}\\,{=}\\,\\frac{j A}{4\\mathsf{F}n}\n$$\n \b  \n\nwhere,   $j$   is current density   $(\\textsf{A}\\textsf{c m}^{-2})$  ),  A  is the geometric area of the  electrode   $(\\mathsf{I}\\times\\mathsf{I}\\ c m^{2})$  , F is Faraday constant   $(96485\\textsf{s A m o l}^{-1})$  ), and  $n$   is  the number of moles of the metal in the electrode  \n\nDFT Calculation : Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed  with the Vienna Ab-initio simulation software package (VASP). The  generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof  was used to explain the exchange-correlation energy. A 520  eV plane  wave cutoff and a   $2\\times1\\times1$   gamma-centered Monkhorst–Pack k-point  grid were used for the calculations. Each supercell contains 150 atoms  and has a vacuum of   $15\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   in the   $+\\mathsf{c}$  direction to avoid interaction  between the slabs. The structural composition is shown in Table S1,  Supporting Information. The free energies of intermediates, including   $^{*}\\bigcirc$   and   $^{\\ast}O O H$  , were calculated relative to   $\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$   and   $\\mathsf{H}_{2}$  , using the  following equations:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta G_{*0}=G_{*0}+G_{\\mathsf{H}_{2}}-G_{*}-G_{\\mathsf{H}_{2}0}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathsf{G}_{\\ast\\mathsf{O}\\mathsf{O}\\mathsf{H}}=\\mathsf{G}_{\\ast\\mathsf{O}\\mathsf{O}\\mathsf{H}}+\\frac{3}{2}\\mathsf{G}_{\\mathsf{H}_{2}}-\\mathsf{G}_{\\ast}-2\\mathsf{G}_{\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $^*$   is an active site on the surface of the catalyst,   $^{*}\\bigcirc$   and   $^{\\ast}{\\sf O O H}$  are intermediates adsorbed on the active sites.
