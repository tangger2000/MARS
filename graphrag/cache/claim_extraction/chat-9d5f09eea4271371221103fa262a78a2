Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The ability of DMF to fully dissolve these components is essential for the subsequent controlled crystallization process when this solution is mixed with a poor solvent.

The as-cleaned substrates were treated by UV–ozone for 10 min. Then,  different concentrations of indium nitrate pentahydrate were spin-coated  onto the ITO substrates at 8000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   then annealed at   $\\ 780\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $40~\\mathsf{m i n}$   in ambient air. After that, the annealed substrates were cleaned  by UV–ozone for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . Then,   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   solution was spin-coated onto  the substrates at 4000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   and annealed at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $20~\\mathsf{m i n}$  .   $\\mathsf{I}.3\\textsf{M}\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}$   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   at the speed of  1500 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   and annealed at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 5 min. When the   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   film  was cooled down to room temperature, a mixture solution of organic  salt (FAI:MAI:MACl  $\\l=60{:}6{:}6\\l$  ) was spin-coated onto the   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   film at a  speed of 1600 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   followed by annealing at   $\\ 150\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 20 min  in ambient air (about   $40\\%$   humidity).

Finally,   $80~\\mathsf{n m}$   of Au top electrode was thermally  evaporated under vacuum with a shadow mask. The area of the cells was   $0.12\\ {\\sf c m}^{2}$  ; when measuring, a   $0.0887~\\mathsf{c m}^{2}$   mask was used to define the  accurate aperture area for the cells.  \n\nDevice Characterizations : SEM (FEI NanoSEM650) was used to  characterize the morphology of the   $|\\mathsf{n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  , and perovskite films  and also the cross-sectional image of the fully device. The XRD patterns  of the perovskite films were performed by Mini Flex 600 (Rigaku  D/MAX-2500, Japan). The EQE spectra were conducted in air without  encapsulate by the Enli Tec (Taiwan) measurement system. The current– voltage characteristics of the devices were measured by a Keithley 2400  Source meter under AM 1.5G illumination with a xenon-lamp-based solar  simulator (Enli. Tec., Taiwan). The intensity of the light was calibrated  with a KG-5 filter Si photodiode. And the cells were measured with a  metal mask   $(0.0887\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{2})$   to reduce the influence of the scattered light.  The measuring condition was forward scan   $(0{-}1.2\\,\\lor,$   scan rate  $20\\:\\mathsf{m V\\:S^{-1}}$  ,  delay time   $20\\ \\mathsf{m s}.$  ) and reverse scan   $\\scriptstyle{(1.2-0\\ \\vee,}$   scan rate   $20\\,\\mathrm{\\mV\\,\\sf{s}^{-1}}$  ,  delay time   $20\\;\\mathrm{\\mums},$  ). The best PSCs were sent to an PV calibration  laboratory (Quality supervision and Testing Center of Chemical and  Physical Power Sources of Information Industry, China) for certification.  The AFM images were characterized by atomic force microscopy  (NanoNavi-SPA400, Japan). The PL and TRPL spectra were carried  out via a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS980, Edinburgh  Instruments, UK).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the supports from National  Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No.  2018 Y FB 1500103), the National Natural Science Foundation of China  (Grant No. 61674084), the Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for  Discipline Innovation of Higher Education of China (Grant No. B16027),  Tianjin Science and Technology Project (Grant No. 18 ZX J MT G 00220),  and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,  Nankai University (Grant Nos. 63191736 and ZB19500204).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ncarrier transfer, electron-transport layer, energy alignment engineering,  perovskite solar cells  \n\nReceived: September 4, 2019 Revised: December 4, 2019 Published online:  \n\n[3]\t a) Q.  Jiang, Y.  Zhao, X.  Zhang, X.  Yang, Y.  Chen, Z.  Chu, Q.  Ye,  X.  Li, Z.  Yin, J.  You,  Nat.
