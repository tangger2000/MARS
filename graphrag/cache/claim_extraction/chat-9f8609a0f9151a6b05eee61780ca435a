For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized.

Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The possible reason for these discrepancies in crystal orientation is that the   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene  nanosheets with   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   groups serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites during the crystallization process of perovskite  films.

The crystallinity of these perovskite films is further characterized by the  X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Figure   $^{4\\mathrm{g})}$  ). The main  peaks located at 13.88, 19.73, 31.49, and  $40.22^{\\circ}$   are correspond to  the (101), (110), (113), and (220) planes of the   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  film.  It is clear that the   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   film grown on the   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene substrate exhibits stronger peak intensities,  which further confirms the better crystal lin it y compared with  \n\nthat grown on the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene substrate. Similarly, the  orientation growth of perovskite films grown on   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$    MXene substrate and doped with  $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets  are observed. The highly oriented growth of perovskite film is  beneficial to improve the charge transfer efficiency and reduce  energy loss in the bulk film.  The absorbance spectra of perovskite films grown on different substrates and doped with   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{-}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   MXene nanosheets are shown in Figure  4h. The  perovskite film grown on the   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene substrate  exhibits slightly higher absorbance in the wavelength range  from 550 to   $750\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  .

The defect states seriously affect the  performance of PVSCs because they will capture photo-generated carriers and cause severe energy loss. The space chargelimited current curves of electron-only devices   $\\mathrm{(ITO/Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT_{x}/}$  Perovskite/PCBM/Ag) are measured to illustrate the trap density of perovskite films deposited on various substrates  (Figure 4i). The trap density of perovskite films can be calculated by using   $V_{_{T F L}}\\!=\\!\\frac{\\displaystyle q N_{_{t r a p}}L^{2}}{\\displaystyle2\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon}$  , where   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is the onset voltage of  the trap-filled limit (TFL) region, which is positively correlated  to the trap density   $(N_{\\mathrm{trap}})$  ,   $q$   is the elemental charge,   $L$   is the  thickness of perovskite films,   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity and   $\\varepsilon$   is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite.  The  measured   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   of   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   films deposited on   $\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{-}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$    MXene and   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene substrates are 0.28 and   $0.20\\,\\mathrm{~V.}$  .  The corresponding   $N_{\\mathrm{trap}}$   of these   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   films are calculated to be   $4.86~\\times\\dot{~}10^{15}$   and   $3.47~\\times~10^{15}~\\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$  . For the   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   film doped with   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets  grown on the  $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene substrate, the   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is  $0.16~\\mathrm{V}$   and  the corresponding   $N_{\\mathrm{trap}}$   is calculated as  $2.78\\times10^{15}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . It can  be seen that the   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets with   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$    groups can reduce the trap density of perovskite film. The lower  trap density of perovskite film is decisive in reducing   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$    caused by trap states-induced non radiative recombination and  improving the device performance.  The   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene  nanosheets additive in the perovskite film may serve as recombination centers because they can easily capture electrons from  the perovskite.
