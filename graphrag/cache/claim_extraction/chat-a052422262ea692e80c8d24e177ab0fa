Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The substrates were treated by ultraviolet-ozone for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$    before use. Poly-TPD was dissolved in chl oro benzene at a concentration  of   $6~\\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$  . Poly-TPD was spin-coated on ITO at 1000 rpm for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$  ,  followed by thermal annealing at   $\\ 150\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $20~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The poly-TPD layer  was treated by   ${\\sf O}_{2}$   plasma for  $6\\textsf{s}$   to improve wetting. The spin-coating  rate for perovskite was   $3000\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$  , and   $100~\\upmu L$  toluene was dropped on  the spinning substrate at  $5\\ s$  . All perovskite films were dried at  $90~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\mathsf{T0}\\,\\mathsf{r n i n}$   to fully dry the film and ensure the full reaction of the precursors.  TPBi, LiF, and Al layers were sequentially evaporated on top of the  perovskite film with thicknesses of 40, 1.2, and  $100\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  , respectively. The  device area was  $0.04\\;{\\sf c m}^{2}$  .  \n\nDevice Characterization : All PeLED device characterizations were  carried out at room temperature in a nitrogen-filled glovebox using  a homemade motorized goniometer setup consisting of a Keithley  2400 source meter unit, a calibrated Si photodiode (FDS-100-CAL,  Thorlabs), a pico ammeter (4140B, Agilent), and a calibrated fiber optic  spectrophotometer (UVN-SR, StellarNet Inc.).  \n\nCharacterization : SEM measurements were conducted with a fieldemission SEM (FEI Nova 230). XRD measurements were performed  with an  $\\mathsf{X}^{\\prime}$   Pert Pro MPD (Philips) diffract o meter in the Bragg-Brentano  parallel beam geometry, and a conventional Cu target X-ray tube.  Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy spectra were collected on  Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi. A He I ultraviolet radiation source  (21.22 eV) was used. The XPS measurements were conducted with  Thermo Scientific Escalab  $250\\times\\mathrm{i}$   by using a mono chroma ti zed Al source   $(h\\nu~=~\\rceil486.6$   eV). FTIR measurements were conducted by using  absorption infrared spectrometer (VERTX). All samples were prepared by  mixing with KBr powder. Absorption spectra were measured on a Perkin  Elmer Lambda 950 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. The steady-state PL and  PLQY data were measured using a Horiba Fluorolog-3 system with Petite  Integrating Sphere. The excitation wavelength was   $430\\,\\mathsf{n m}$  . The excitation  power density in the power-dependent PLQY characterization was tuned  by varying the neutral density filter and slit width. TRPL was taken using  a Horiba photon-counting input module. The samples were excited  by a pulsed laser diode (NanoLED-Horiba) with a center wavelength  of   $369\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$  , an excitation intensity of   $0.6\\,\\textrm{\\textmu}{\\mathbb{m}}\\mathbb{W}\\textrm{\\textmu}{\\mathsf{c m}}^{-2}$  , and a repetition  rate that was less than the reciprocal of the measurement range.  \n\nThey were sufficiently fit with bi-exponentials:  decay ( )  $\\left(t\\right){=}\\sum_{n{=1}}^{2}B_{n}e^{-t/T_{n}}$  ,   $T_{\\mathrm{average}}=\\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{2}B_{\\mathrm{n}}T_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2}}{\\sum_{n=1}^{2}B_{\\mathrm{n}}T_{\\mathrm{n}}}$  , where  $B_{\\mathfrak{n}}$   are normalized coefficients and   $T_{\\mathfrak{n}}$  are time  \n\n# constants.  \n\nDFT Calculation : All first-principles calculations were performed  with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). Electron– nuclei interactions were described by the projector-augmented wave  pseudo potentials.  The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation  functional was investigated in all calculations.  The Kohn–Sham  wave functions were expanded in plane waves up to 400 eV. A K-point  mesh of   $3\\times3\\times1$   for   $2\\times2\\times\\mathsf{I}$   slab supercell of (001) surface was  used. The slab models were built with a vacuum region more than   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$  in the   $Z$  -direction in conjunction with the dipole correction to  avoid the fictitious interaction with its periodic images. The convergence  threshold of energy in the self-consistent step was set as   $\\mathsf{T O^{-5}}$   eV with  a Gaussian smearing of 0.01 eV   $\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{-1}$  . Moreover, the force threshold  of geometry optimation is   $0.02\\;\\mathrm{\\sf~eV~}\\;\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{-1}$   for each dimension of all  atoms in supercell. The DOS was calculated by employing Heyb– Scuseria–Ernzehof functional. To simplify the calculation of complex   $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.33}\\mathsf{C s}_{0.67}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{I}_{0.7}\\mathsf{B r}_{0.3})_{3}$   alloy, employed was a four-layer   $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.4}\\mathsf{C s}_{0.6}\\mathsf{P b}|_{3}$   $2\\times2\\times1$   slab to simulate the dual pass iv ation effect of FPMATFA. The  formation energy of defects, such as halide anion dangling bonds and  under coordinated lead was defined as:   $E_{\\mathsf{f}}=E_{\\mathsf{A}}+\\,E_{\\mathsf{B}}-\\,E_{\\mathsf{p}}$  ristine surface . And  the formation energy of defect passivated by C (FPMA cations or TFA  anions) was defined as:   $E_{\\mathsf{f}}=\\,E_{\\mathsf{A}}\\,+\\,E_{\\mathsf{C}}\\,-\\,E_{\\mathsf{p}}$  assivated surface . Where   $E_{\\mathsf{A}}$   and  E pristine surface  are the total energy of the surface with and without defect,  respectively, and   $E_{\\mathsf{p a s s i v a t e d\\;s u r f a c e}}$   is the total energy of the surface after  pass iv ation.   $E_{8}$   is the chemical potential of the corresponding ion   $(\\mathsf{F A}^{+}$   for halide anion dangling bonds and  $|^{-}$   for under coordinated lead)  and  $E_{\\mathsf{C}}$   is the chemical potential of the pas siva ting ion   $(\\mathsf{F P M A^{+}}$   for halide  anion dangling bonds and  $\\mathsf{T F A^{-}}$   for under coordinated lead).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nZ.F. and W.C. contributed equally to this work.
