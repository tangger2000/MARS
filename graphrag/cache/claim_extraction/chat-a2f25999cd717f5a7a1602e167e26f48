Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Here, we review these factors that  cause instability of MHP materials. We categorize  the instability in PeLEDs into two types; i.e., instability of: (i) the MHP  materials and (ii) the constituent layers and interfaces in PeLED  devices. Then, we critically review recent studies that have tried  to improve the stability of MHP materials and PeLEDs. Based  on advances made in these studies, we present insight toward  future research directions and an outlook of PeLEDs for practical applications.  \n\n# 2. Origins of the Low Stability of PeLEDs  \n\n# 2.1. Intrinsic Instability of MHP Materials  \n\nMany MHP materials undergo significant changes in structural and op to electronic properties under phase transitions,  thermal stress, air exposure, and illumination; some previous  review papers have reported these instabilities of MHPs. However, such reviews have mainly focused on applications of  MHPs in solar cells. In this section, we review previous reports  about the intrinsic instability of MHPs, with a focus on how  this instability affects the luminescence properties of MHPs.  Also, we review instability of MHP NPs in the solution and  film states.  \n\n# 2.1.1. Influence of the Crystal Structure on Stability  \n\nMHPs can generally have three crystal structures: cubic,  tetragonal, and ortho rhombi c, which can be transformed  into each other reversibly by temperature change or chemical  exchange of halide anions. The cubic perovskite structure is  highly symmetric and thermodynamic ally more stable than  the tetragonal and ortho rhombi c perovskite structures because  of the lowest formation energy among three structures. The structure of MHPs can be determined by calculating the  tolerance factor  \n\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{f}}={\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{A}}+R_{\\mathrm{X}}}{{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{B}}+R_{\\mathrm{X}}\\right)}}\n$$  \n\nand the octahedral factor  \n\n$$\no_{\\mathrm{c}}={\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{B}}}{R_{\\mathrm{X}}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $R_{\\mathrm{{A}}},\\ R_{\\mathrm{{B}}}$  , and   $R_{X}$   are the effective radii of the A, B,  and   $\\mathrm{X}$   ions, respectively.  MHPs have cubic structure   $(P m3m)$   when   $0.813\\protect\\leq t_{\\mathrm{f}}\\protect\\leq1.107$   and   $0.442\\leq o_{\\mathsf{c}}\\leq0.895$  ;  other­ wise it has a tetragonal   $(I4/m c m)$   or ortho rhombi c   $(P n a2_{1})$   structure. Therefore, it is very important to control  the radii of the constituent ions to make a stable cubic perovskite structure. Considering the effective radii of halogen  anions (  $\\cdot\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$  : 167 pm;   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$  : 182 pm; I − : 206 pm),   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   have cubic structure and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
