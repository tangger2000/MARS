TRPL  and PL have been frequently applied to evaluate the quality  of the perovskite films, but the measured lifetime does not  correspond to the charge recombination lifetime in the device  under open-circuit conditions.

The  devices were soaked under AM 1.5G simulated illumination,  and attenuated laser pulses (  $337\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , 4 ns) were applied to cause  a small disturbance to open-circuited devices, which triggered  a small transient photovoltaic signal. As seen in Figure 5b, the  TPV transient lifetime of the device with DPSI pass iv ation was  increased from 330 ns for the device without DPSI to 536 ns for  the device DPSI pass iv ation.
