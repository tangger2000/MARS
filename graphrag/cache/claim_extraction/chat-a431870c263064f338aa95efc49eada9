Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

To understand the excellent rate capability of the   $S/\\mathrm{CNT}/$  PrNP cathode, CV was conducted at a scan rate of   $0.05\\ \\mathrm{mV}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  .  Two cathodic peaks were observed at   $2.2–2.4$   and   $2.0{-}2.1\\;\\mathrm{~V~}$    (Figure S7, Supporting Information), representing the stepwise  reduction of S to LiPSs and further to   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$  , respectively.   The slightly shifted peak in the high voltage toward left in the  PrNP cell was attributed to a lower content of CNT in   $S/\\mathrm{CNT}/$  PrNP composite compared with the routine   $S/\\mathrm{CNT}$   electrode.  Owing to the anchoring LiPS and promoting the LiPS conversion in the subsequent reductions, the PrNP cell demonstrated  sharper cathodic peaks than a routine cell. Interestingly, the  anodic process in a PrNP cell displayed two unambiguous  peaks while the routine cell represented a broad peak that  almost merged two anodic peaks, indicating the sluggish oxidation kinetics of insulating   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   compounds in PrNP-free cells.  \n\nTo reveal the role of the   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   promoter on the actual Li–S  batteries, the electrochemical performance was collected on  cells with the   $S/C N T/P r N P$   composite cathode. The   $S/C N T/$   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   electrode with   $70\\%$   S and   $10\\%$   PrNP delivered a discharge capacity of   $986~\\mathrm{mA}$   h   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   at   $0.2{\\mathrm{~C~}}$  . Further increasing  current density to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and   $4.0\\,\\mathrm{~C~}$   maintained reversible capacities of 853, 796, 753, and   $351~\\mathrm{mA}$   h  $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$  , respectively  ( Figure   4 a). When abruptly switching current density from  4 to   $0.2{\\mathrm{~C~}}$  again, the discharge capacity of   $854\\mathrm{\\mA\\hag}\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$   was  resumed. However, the   $\\mathrm{CNT}/S$   cathode with   $70\\%$   S exhibited a  \n\nThe inter facial affinity to LiPSs is the key to retard LiPS  \n\nshuttle and thus give rise to a stable Li–S cell in long life cycles.

The  discharge capacity of the cell with   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   displayed an initial capacity of   $793\\mathrm{\\mA}$  h   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   at   $0.5\\,\\mathrm{~C~}$  .

The occurrence of soluble LiPS in the first plateau is closely related  to the LiPS shuttle, while the formation of  solid   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   in the second plateau brings up the  cell resistance. The gradual capacity loss in  an Li–S cell intimately correlates to the evolution of these two  plateaus, which emphasize the analysis of high plateau capacity   $(Q_{\\mathrm{H}})$   and low plateau capacity  $(Q_{\\mathrm{{L}}})$  .  The   $S/C N T/\\mathrm{Pr}\\mathrm{NP}$   cathode  exhibited a mild   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}\\log{}$   in the long cycle tests, attaining  $84.8\\%$  and   $77.1\\%$   of the initial   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}$   in 200 and 400 cycles, respectively (Figure   $\\mathrm{S9a}$  , Supporting Information). However, the  routine   $\\mathrm{S/C}$   cathode displayed a marked   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}$   drop in the first  50 cycles and only maintained  $52.8\\%$   after 200 cycles. The similar capacity tendency can be identified in   $Q_{\\mathrm{{L}}}$   of two types of  cathodes (Figure S9b, Supporting Information). In general, the   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}$   determines the   $Q_{\\mathrm{{L}}}$   to some extent since the weak LiPS  bonding energy on the conductive scaffold inevitably causes the  rapid   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}$   loss upon cycling, which subsequently worsens electrolyte, impedes   $\\mathrm{Li^{+}}$   diffusion, and builds up barriers for   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$  precipitation.  The   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   addition in the S cathode is capable  of regulating the LiPS diffusion,   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   nucleation, and propagation, and eventually influences the overall capacity of a cell.  \n\nTo understand the kinetic characteristics of a   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   cell,  electrochemical impedance spectra were performed in the  1st and 50th cycles (Figure S10a, Supporting Information).  The intercept in the high-frequency regions was a measure of  the bulk electrolyte resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$   in a cell and the semicircle  in the high–medium-frequency region represented charge  transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$  , which reflected the electrode/electrolyte inter facial resistance. In the first cycle, the cell with the   $S/C/\\mathrm{Pr}\\mathrm{NP}$   cathode exhibited an almost equal   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$     $(20.2\\ \\Omega)$   to  the routine cell   $(22.4\\ \\Omega)$  , indicating the comparable inter facial  resistance at the initial state. After the extended 50 cycling, a  noticeable augment of   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$     $(41.6~\\Omega)$   can be identified in a routine cell while the PrNP cell achieved a similar value   $(20.9\\ \\Omega)$\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
