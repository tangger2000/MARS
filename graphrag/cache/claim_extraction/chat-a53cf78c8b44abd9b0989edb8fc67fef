Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

It  is apparent that the transmittance decreases with increase of  the ITO layer thickness, while the conductivity is significantly  increased as expected. Accordingly, the F-PSCs based on various ITO thicknesses were fabricated, and their current densityâ€“voltage   $(J-V)$   characteristics and key parameters are shown  in Figure S5b and Table S2 (Supporting Information). It can be  seen that the device with   $90\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick ITO gives the highest   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   due to the good transmittance, while the FF is the smallest  because of the largest sheet resistance   $(92~\\Omega)$  . When the ITO  thickness is increased to   $180\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   evidently decreased  owing to the inferior transmittance. Finally, in order to keep a  good balance between high optical transmittance and low sheet  resistance to obtain optimized result,   $160\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick ITO was  \n\ncoated on PET substrates to fabricated the F-PSCs. The PCE  reaches to   $16.64\\%$   with  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $21.46\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.092, and  FF of 0.710. In addition, when   $\\mathrm{MgF}_{2}$   was used to reduce optical  reflection (Figure S6a, Supporting Information), the PCE is further increased to   $17.03\\%$   (Figure S6b, Supporting Information). The DS volume ratio with solvent was further optimized on  the basis of the above results. For the test, the F-PSCs with different DS concentrations were investigated to clarify the influence of the DS on the performance of the F-PSCs. Figure S7  (Supporting Information) shows the  $J{-}V$  curves of the flexible  devices, with key  $J{-}V$  parameters summarized in Table S3 (Supporting Information). It is clear that the PCE initially increases  when the DS volume ratio is increased from   $0\\%$   to   $10\\%$  . It  reaches the maximum at   $10\\%$  . It then decreases with the DS  volume ratio. Apparently, when the DS volume ratio is smaller  than   $10\\%$  , it is too low to cause significant effect because of  the weak interaction with   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   cation, yielding low FF and therefore poor PCE. However, when the volume ratio is over   $10\\%$  the excessive DS would cause higher   $R_{s}$   and smaller shunt  resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{sh}})$   (Table S3, Supporting Information), resulting  in reduced FF.  Consequently, we adopted   $10\\%$   DS to modify  the perovskite films and fabricate high performance F-PSCs.  Figure 2b shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the completed device, it is clear that the perovskite crystal grains grow  large enough to go through the film thickness, consistent with  the top-view SEM results (Figure 1c). Figure 2c shows the  $J{-}V$  curves of F-PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$   under AM   $1.5G$   illumination with   $100\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}}$   at both reverse and forward scan directions, with key  $J{-}V$   parameters listed in  Table   1 The flexible device without DS additive under reverse scan directions exhibits the PCE of   $17.03\\%$   with   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\,=\\,21.97~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}=1.090{\\mathrm{~V}},$   and   $\\mathrm{FF}=0.711$  . Interestingly, when the DS additive was used under the same conditions, the   ${\\cal J}_{\\mathrm{sc}},\\ {\\cal V}_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   and FF  increase to   $22.48\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  ,   $1.103\\;\\mathrm{~V~},$  , and 0.742, respectively,  yielding a PCE as high as   $18.40\\%$  , the highest reported so far  for F-PSCs. The significantly larger   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF are attributed  to good crystal lin it y and large grain size, resulting in effective  charge transport and less carrier recombination at grain boundaries.  We fabricated   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$   solar cells on both flexible and rigid substrates using identical condition, including  the spin-coating procedure, annealing temperature and time,  etc. The XRD patterns reveal that the   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}â€“\\mathrm{DS}}$   deposited  on glass/ITO/  ${\\mathrm{Yb}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}_{5}$   substrate displays lower intensity of (110)  peak with wider full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.22  than that of   $\\mathrm{PET/ITO/Nb_{2}O_{5}/M A P b I_{3}-D S}$  with the narrow  FWHM of 0.19 at the same location, as shown in Figure S8a  (Supporting Information), indicating that the MAPbI 3 â€“DS  exhibits inferior crystalline quality when deposited on the rigid  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/e85c9155c02e5fdc240abdc2a66428ce8a02b2e474363117c4c2c59a441042fc-1727118085.jpg)  \nFigure 2. â€‚ a) Illustration of the F-PSC structure. b) Cross-sectional SEM image of a completed flexible device with the   $\\mathsf{M A P b}|_{3}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{D S}$   absorber. c)  $J^{-V}$    curves of F-PSCs under both reverse and forward scan directions using   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   and MAPbI 3 â€“DS as the absorber layer. d) Stable current density and  PCE of the F-PSCs based on   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$  â€“DS measured when the device was biased at 0.84 and  $0.88\\;\\lor,$   respectively. e) The PCEs of flexible  device based on   $\\mathsf{M A P b}|_{3}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{D S}$   at different bending curvature radii after 5000 flexing cycles.  \n\nTable 1.  $\\mathsf{k e y}J\\mathrm{-}V$   parameters of the F-PSCs. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/25172e7dbf8e58b2377cb42d1cfe1633d970b5490800f4eee08493962fbead22-1727118068.jpg)  \na) The active area of the cell is  $0.052\\;{\\sf c m}^{2}$   for F-PSCs.  \n\nsubstrate using the same condition.

In order to form high film quality on rigid substrates, the deposition conditions need further optimization,  as demonstrated in the previous work.  It is well-known that  the performance of perovskite solar cells strongly depends on  the crystalline quality of the perovskite absorber layer, which is  closely related to the annealing process, including temperature  and annealing time. It is apparent that the glass substrate needs  more time   $(\\approx\\!7\\,\\mathrm{min})$  ) than that of PET   $({\\approx}3\\ \\mathrm{min})$  ) to reach   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ,  as shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). Therefore, in  order to improve the crystalline quality of the perovskite layer\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
