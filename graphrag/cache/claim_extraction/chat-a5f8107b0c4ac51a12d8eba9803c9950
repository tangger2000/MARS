Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Upon the application of   $2.82\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE, grey bismuth metal powder was  grown on the Pt electrode (Figure S1a, Supporting Information), while transparent BPFs with brown color were successfully deposited on the FTO substrates (Figure S1b, Supporting  Information). The as-prepared BPFs are amorphous, since no  obvious peaks can be detected in the X-ray diffraction (XRD)  patterns in addition to the FTO signals (Figure S1c, Supporting Information). After calcination at   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for   $2\\textrm{h}$  , the  amorphous BPFs were converted to crystalline bismuth oxide  films composed of   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2.33}$     $\\mathrm{\\Delta]CPDS~No.~00-027-0051}$  ) and   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   $(\\mathrm{JCPDS~No.~00}{\\cdot}027{\\cdot}0050)$  , as shown in Figure S1d (Supporting  Information). To further confirm the chemical states and composition of the BPFs, electrode position of the BPFs for   $1.5\\textrm{h}$  before (BPF-1.5h) and after calcination (BPF-1.5h-C) were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown  in Figure S2a (Supporting Information), both samples exhibit  the same binding energy at   ${\\approx}164.2$   (Bi   $4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2})$   and   $158.9\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{~\\mathrm{eV}}}$  (Bi   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2})$  , indicating the main chemical state of bismuth is \n\n  $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   in both samples.  The binding energy values of O 1s at \n\n 529.6, 531.1, and   $532.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   are observed in the BPF-1.5h and  BPF-1.5h-C films (Figure S2b, Supporting Information), corresponding to   $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$   species in the lattice   $(\\mathrm{O_{L})}$  , hydroxyl groups  bonded to the metal cations in the oxygen deficient region   $(\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}})$  and chem is or bed or dissociated oxygen species from the water  molecules   $(\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{C}})$  .  In particular, the relative intensity of the   $\\mathrm{O_{V}}$  peak is increased after calcination, suggesting the formation of  oxygen vacancies, which conforms to the main crystal structure  of   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2.33}$   observed from XRD (Figure S1d, Supporting Information). In addition, both samples show similar C 1s spectra  attributed to the adventitious carbon species,  suggesting  that no carbon is bonded into the lattice during the electrodeposition process. Although the release of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   from the  electrolysis of acetic acid is likely to take place at such a high  external potential during the electrode position process,  the  formation of bismuth carbonate compounds (e.g.,   $(\\mathrm{SiO})_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}$   or   $\\mathrm{(SiO)}_{4}\\mathrm{(OH)}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}\\mathrm{)}$  ) is not favorable due to the strong acidic environment   $(\\mathrm{pH}\\,=\\,0.44)$  . Therefore, BPFs achieved after electrodeposition are amorphous bismuth oxide.  \n\nThe morph o logie s of the as-prepared BPFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in  Figure S3a (Supporting Information), the FTO substrate is  partly covered by bismuth oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with an  average size of  ${\\approx}50$   nm when the electrode position time is  $0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$  .  The FTO crystals can be clearly observed. When the electrodeposition time is increased to   $^{1\\mathrm{~h~}}$  , the average size of the  NPs is increased to about   $100~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  , which is uniformly grown  on the FTO substrates and no FTO crystals can be observed  (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). The particle size is further increased with longer electrode position time (Figure S3c,d,  Supporting Information).  \n\nAfter calcination with vanadyl acetyl ace to nate and the subsequent removal of the excessive   $\\mathrm{V}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{5}$  , the corresponding transparent yellow films can be achieved ( Figure   1 a). XRD confirms  that the films have been totally converted into   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$  . Along  with the FTO peaks, only monoclinic   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   peaks (JCPDS  No. 00-014-0688) can be observed (Figure 1b), indicating that  no impurities are formed in the BVO-0.5h, BVO-1h, BVO-1.5h,  and BVO-2h films. Interestingly, a relatively strong peak located  at  $28.9^{\\circ}$   can be observed, which is attributed to the {121} facets,  indicating that the   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   films are preferentially grown along  the   $\\{121\\}$   direction.  SEM images show that the   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   films  are composed of adjoining grains ranging from 200 to   $500~\\mathrm{nm}$    (Figure 1c–f). For the BVO-0.5h sample, the BVO crystals can  only partially cover the FTO substrate and the exposed FTO  crystals can be observed (Figure 1c). The BVO layer can be  hardly identified in the cross-sectional SEM image (inset in  Figure 1c). In contrast, the FTO substrate is fully covered by  the BVO crystals and some obvious pores can be observed  between the grains in the BVO-1h film (Figure 1d). The film  thickness is around   $120~\\mathrm{nm}$   (inset in Figure 1d). While for the  BVO-1.5h and BVO-2h films, the BVO crystals connect together  and no obvious pores can be observed (Figure 1e,f). The film  thicknesses are around 250 and   $370\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , respectively (insets in  Figure 1e,f).  \n\nTo investigate the front and back illumination charge  separation efficiencies of the obtained   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   films, the PEC  performance was measured in a typical three-electrode cell  (Pt as the counter electrode and  $\\mathrm{Ag/AgCl}$   as the reference electrode) using a borate buffer in the presence of  $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{3}$   as a hole  scavenger under AM   $1.5~\\mathrm{G}$   illumination. All the applied potentials versus  $\\mathrm{Ag/AgCl}$   have been converted to the corresponding  potentials versus RHE. Owing to the low activation energy  and fast kinetics for the oxidation of   ${\\mathrm{SO}}_{3}{}^{2-}$  species,  all  the photo generated holes reaching the photo electrode/electrolyte interface would be consumed immediately and the effect  of surface charge recombination can be completely excluded.  As shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), all samples  exhibit better photo current densities under back illumination  than under front illumination, which is attributed to the better  hole transport property than the electron transport property in  the undoped   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   films.  In particular, the BVO-1.5h film  exhibits an optimized photo current density of   $5.38\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$    at   $1.23~\\mathrm{V}$   versus RHE under back illumination. To make better  use of the light, another identical BVO-1.5h film was located  behind the BVO-1.5h film to form dual   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photo anodes  (denoted as 2-BVO-1.5h), as shown in Figure S5 (Supporting  Information). As expected, the photo current density can  be further increased to   $6.22\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}^{-2}}$\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
