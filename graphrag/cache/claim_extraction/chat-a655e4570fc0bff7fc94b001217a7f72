Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

As shown  in Figure 4f, a planar PSC with an active area   $(1.0\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   shows  a PCE of   $19.05\\%$     $(18.74\\%)$   measured under reverse (forward)  voltage scan direction. In this case, a phenyl-C61-butyric acid  methyl ester (PCBM) inter facial layer was introduced to fabricate high-performance, hysteresis-free, and large-area PSC  device.  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESLs are also suitable for fabricating  efficient PSCs using other perovskite absorbers, e.g., \n\n  $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  . To reduce hysteresis, PCBM was introduced at \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ESL/perovskite interface to form a   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P C B M}$   bilayer \n\n (Figure S19, Supporting Information). The best-performing  PSC with a   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   active layer achieved a high PCE of   $20.26\\%$     $(19.62\\%)$   measured under reverse (forward) voltage  scan (Figure S15b, Supporting Information). A high SPO of   $19.73\\%$   was obtained (Figure S15c, Supporting Information).  The PSCs using  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESLs without PCBM inter facial layer  exhibited a poorer PCE of   $19.41\\%$     $(17.62\\%)$   measured under  reverse (forward) voltage scan and a SPO of   $18.46\\%$  . The averaged PCEs of both types of devices were extracted from 40 separate cells for each type (Figure S15d, Supporting Information).  The averaged PCEs for the cells with and without PCBM interfacial layer are   $19.21\\pm0.65\\%$   and   $18.40\\pm0.58\\%$  , respectively.  \n\nPSCs are characterized to understand the correlation  between device performance and carrier concentration of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   QD ESLs.  Figure   5 a shows the average series and  shunt resistance (  $R_{s}$   and   $R_{\\mathrm{sh}})$   of the PSCs using   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   QD  ESLs annealed at different temperature. As the temperature  increase, the   $R_{s}$   (  $(R_{\\mathrm{sh}})$   first decreases (increases), reaches a  minimum (maximum) value at the temperature of   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , and  then increases (decreases). For good solar cells, the   $R_{s}$   should  be as small as possible, while the   $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$   should be as large as  possible. Both   $R_{s}$   and   $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$   depend on the carrier concentration  of ESLs. The   $R_{s}$   (  $.R_{\\mathrm{sh}})$   would be too large (small) if the carrier  concentration is too low or too high. The results reveal an  optimal carrier concentration of around   $10^{15}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . Such a carrier density cannot be easily obtained without film break down  for   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   NC ESLs.  \n\nTo further investigate the charge transport dynamic process and interface electronic properties employing   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   QD  and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   NC ESLs, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  measurements. Figure 5b shows TRPL profiles measured from  perovskite absorbers deposited on FTO,   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   QD, and NC  ESL substrates. The TRPL results showed obvious bi-exponential decay behavior. It is seen that the perovskite deposited on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESLs shows the shortest carrier lifetime, indicating  the fastest charge transfer. The perovskite film deposited on  FTO substrate exhibits a mean lifetime of 14.724 ns, while the  per ovsk ites deposited on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD and NC ESLs exhibit mean  carrier lifetimes of, 1.411 and 6.357 ns, respectively (Table S5,  Supporting Information). The EIS measurements show that  the recombination rate is lower at the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESL/perovskite  interface than at   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   NC ESL/perovskite interface films.   Figure 5c shows the Nyquist plots of the devices employing   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   NC ESLs. The semicircles in the low and  high frequency are assigned to be the recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$   and the transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{tr}})$  , respectively. The larger   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   and smaller   $R_{\\mathrm{tr}}$   of the device with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESL demonstrated more efficient charge extraction and suppressed charge  recombination at interface, resulting in improved device performance, which is consistent with our  $J{-}V$  data in Figure 4 and  Figure S8 in the Supporting Information.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/8d8bf0c16b23d7fb4a7b4a5cf1913c0eb8c5784e4c7b12c6577aaaf37da1252f-1723832941.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $J^{-V}$   curves of the best-performing device based on   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   QD ESL measured in different voltage scan  directions. b) The SPO of the device at a constant bias voltage of   $0.95\\;\\lor.$   c) The EQE result for the device. d)  $J^{-V}$   curves of the device measured with  different step delay times. e) The  J – V  curve of the best-performing device based on   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   QDs-coated ITO/PEN substrate.

During the light soaking stability  test, the temperature of the tested device gradually increased to  approximately   $50~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  .

Figure   6 a shows   $J{-}V$   curves measured at a   $20\\ \\mathrm{min}$   interval in an ambient condition (humidity  ${\\approx}40\\%$  ). It is worth noting that our PSCs using   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESLs exhibit good photo stability (detailed results  are shown in Table S6 in the Supporting Information).   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   is  known to exhibit a strong photo catalytic activity for oxidizing  organic materials, resulting in photo catalytic degradation of the  hybrid perovskite under UV illumination.  Several attempts  have been made to address UV-induced stability issue.  We  also expose our PSCs using   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   QD ESLs to UV radiation.  Encouragingly, no obvious degradation of device performance  can be founded after   $2\\textrm{h}$   UV radiation, which may primarily  owing to its very low absorption to UV light photons duo to  its wide band gap energy   $(3.8~\\mathrm{eV}\\approx315~\\mathrm{nm}$  ) of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  QD layer  (Figure 6b).
