Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

It should be worth noting that the capability of more exciton harvesting and fast exciton separation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}\\,\\mathrm{QCs}$   can potentially induce the facile coupled electronic  and photonic memory devices. Figure 3b shows the resp on siv it y  of photonic RRAM with respect to incident light irradiance in  which the device is under the illumination with a wavelength  of   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . During the SET process, turn-on voltage steadily  decreases from 2.6, 2.3, 1.7, 1.4 to   $1.1\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , while the on-current  of devices varies from   $2.32\\,\\times\\,10^{-5}$  ,   $5.68\\times10^{-5}$  ,   $4.92\\,\\times\\,10^{-5}$  ,   $5.29\\times10^{-5}$   to  $4.58\\times10^{-5}$   A with the increased illumination intensities from 0, 0.041, 0.069, 0.129 to  $0.153\\;\\mathrm{mW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The obvious  decrease in SET/RESET voltages and increase in HRS currents  are obtained with the increased irradiance. It can be seen that  the current density of the device in HRS state could be converted  from  $10^{-5}$   to   $10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at  $0.5~\\mathrm{V}$   (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Light illumination of   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~}\\mathrm{{cm}}^{-2}$   for 365, 430, 520,  and   $620\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   is applied on the RRAM (Figure S6, Supporting  Information). Except the negligible sensitivity to   $620\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   light,  the results confirm detective spectral response of the device  ranging from 365 to   $520\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . The photo response of device in  HRS state is shown in Figure 3c. The off-current increases to   ${\\approx}10^{-10}$   A under light exposure, while decays to   $10^{-12}$   A immediately when the light is turned off. Retention ability of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    QD-based photonic RRAM under dark condition and light illumination is shown in Figure 3d and Figure 3g, respectively. The  ON/OFF current ratio can be well maintained for more than   $4\\times$   $10^{5}$   s under dark condition and light illumination.  \n\nAnalysis of distribution of ON/OFF currents and switching  voltages are presented to address the reproducibility issue  by measuring   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based photonic RRAM with and  without light illumination. Figure 3e and Figure 3h show  the statistical current distribution of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based  photonic RRAM under dark condition and light illumination,  respectively. The average current values for ON and OFF states  are measured to be   $1.4\\times10^{-5}$   and   $2.9\\times10^{-10}$   A under dark condition, while the values for the light illumination are measured  to be   $4.5\\times10^{-5}$   and   $5.6\\times10^{-10}$   A.

The average SET voltage is shifted  from   $2.6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   (without light) to   $1.0\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   (with light illumination),  while the corresponding RESET voltage is drifted from   $-2.7$  to   $-1.8\\ \\mathrm{V}.$   These data reveal a great control over consistency of  cycle to cycle and device to device, which is the main concern  for the state-of-the-art electronic data storage device.  \n\nConsequently, light and electric field, as the input signals, can  effectively change the resisitive states of the device.  In the logic  operation exhibited in Figure 3a (inputs A and B are the light and  electric field, and output C is the detective current level), we define  the light on state and the light off state as the signal   $^{\\alpha}1^{\\flat}$   and “  $\"0\"$    for input A, the positive electric field and negative electric electrical  field as the signal “1” and   $\"0\"$   for input B, high current level and  low current level as the signal   $\"1\"$   and   $\"0\"$   for output C. The output  C would be   $\"0\"$   only if both of the inputs are   $^{u}0$  .” Otherwise, the  output would always be “1”. This logic operations implemented  our RRAM device can be applied as an   $\\leftrightsquigarrow$   logic gate.  \n\nTo explore the underlying resistive switching mechanism,  experimental studies have been carried out to verify synergies  of electrochemical metal liz ation and valance change in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    QD-based RRAM.  I–V  characteristics of RRAM devices fabricated with inert top electrode materials—gold (Au)—in comparison with Ag electrode are shown in  Figure   4 a. It is clear that  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  -based RRAM with different top electrode materials exhibits typical resistive switching effect. However, the  SET voltage of the ITO/PMMA/CsPbBr 3 /PMMA/Ag structured  memory device is   $2.4~\\mathrm{V},$   which is smaller when compared with  SET voltage of the Au-top-electrode-based RRAM (4.5 V).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/cae0524460728accf29a64c70130fd4d856c2fb58d029dc2db36adaa4aa5c703-1727117036.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
