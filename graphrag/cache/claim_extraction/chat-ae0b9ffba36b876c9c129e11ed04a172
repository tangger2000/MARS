Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

For example, Liu  and co-workers recently reported an ethylene-diamine-­ tetra-acetic-acid  (EDTA)-complexed   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    with  suitable  energy levels, for which the electron mobility was improved  from   $9.92\\ \\times\\ 10^{-4}\\ \\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$   for unmodified   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   to   $2.27\\times10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  ; this modified  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   was used to fabricate  a PSC with a high open-circuit voltage and a champion PCE  of   $21.60\\%$   with negligible hysteresis.  Ren et  al. fabricated a  low-temperature,  solution-processed,  effectively  Nb-doped   $(\\mathrm{Nb}{:}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2})$  ) ETL, for which the PCE increased up to   $17.57\\%$    from the original   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   value of   $15.13\\%$  .  Wei et al. dissolved  a water-soluble polymer (e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG)) in a   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   colloidal aqueous solution and found that the PEG chains  restrained the aggregation of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nanoparticles with reduced  pinholes, resulting in a large nonuniform inter facial area and  enhancing the PCE for planar PSCs from   $16\\%$   (for the unmodified  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL) up to   $19.2\\%$  .  Carbon derivatives, such as carbon  nanotubes, fullerene, graphene, and graphene oxide, have already  been widely used as additives or inter layers in   $\\mathrm{PSCs}^{[12]}$   and have  been reported to improve the morphology and crystal lin it y of  perovskite crystal films and to provide an efficient charge-collection  channel and facilitate electron extraction. Thus, it is worthwhile  to explore the use of these carbon derivatives as additives for  modifying   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   to fabricate an improved ETL for PSCs.  \n\nIn this work, carboxylic acid- and hydroxyl-rich red-carbon  quantum dots (RCQs) were used to fabricate a doped ${\\cdot}\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nO}_{2}$    composite ETL   $\\mathrm{(SDO_{2}{\\cdot}R C Q s)}$  , yielding a superior electron  mobility of   $1.73\\times10^{-2}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   (one of the highest reported  electron mobilities for   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based ETLs), in contrast to  the electron mobility of   $9.32\\,\\times\\,10^{-4}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   for the pristine   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL. Interestingly, the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   surface was found to  become more hydrophilic after the RCQ doping, indicating a  decrease in the Gibbs free energy of the surface, which favors  heterogeneous nucleation of perovskite and yields highquality perovskite films, as described above.  Synchrotronbased grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was used  to prove that the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   layer effectively promotes the  perovskite phase transition from the precursor mesophase to  the perovskite crystal structure. The crystalline-phase purity  of per ovsk ites grown on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   was also purer and more  uniform over the entire film than that of perovskite grown on  pristine   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . Finally, it is notable that the champion PCEs of  the planar PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs reach   $22.77\\%$  , in comparison to   $19.15\\%$   for the control PSCs based on pristine   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  .  The  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQ-based PSCs also showed significantly enhanced  device stability against humidity, preserving over   $95\\%$   of their  initial PCE after   $1000\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$   of exposure under   $40–60\\%$   humidity at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . All of these excellent achievements can be solely attributed to the novel  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RCQs ETL, which should encourage the  wide application of inexpensive carbon quantum dots in the  transporting layer for stable high-performance PSCs, as well as  in other perovskite-based op to electronic devices.  \n\nElectron mobility is clearly a key figure of merit for ETLs in  PSCs.  Figure   1 a shows the  $J{-}V$   characteristics of electron-only  devices with an ITO/Al/ETL/Al structure based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs \n\n (during the film preparation,   $1\\;\\mathrm{vol}\\%$   of RCQs was used in the \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   solution, i.e., the optimized concentration for producing  the highest PSC performance, as is described in the device fabrication section) and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETLs; the electron mobility of these  two ETLs can be calculated by using the space charge-limited  current (SCLC) model. The calculated electron mobility of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   was   $1.73\\times10^{-2}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , which is significantly  larger than those of pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$     $(9.32\\,\\times\\,10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{\\V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{\\s}^{-1})$    and   $\\mathrm{E{-}S n O_{2}}$     $(2.27\\times10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  ), as reported by Liu and  co-workers  To corroborate this finding, we fabricated devices  with a glass/ITO/ETL/Al structure to determine the difference  in conductivity between   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   films with and without RCQs.  The results in  Figure   2 b demonstrate a consistent and significant reduction in the conductivity of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$  . Thus, this  dramatic improvement in the electron mobility of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   can  effectively promote electron transfer in PSCs with reduced  charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface to enhance  performance and suppress hysteresis.
