Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In this case, the lowest energy hole should be  confined in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   core and the electron can delocalize  over the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   core and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell, which could facilitate the  charge transfer and decrease the PL QY. In addition, a faster  emission decay with   ${\\approx}2.1$   ns average lifetime of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   NCs compared with that of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs   $(14.8~\\mathrm{~ns})$   \n\n (Figure 5c and Table S1, Supporting Information) might suggest a rapid charge transfer from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs to the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$    shell. The optical data (absorption, PL, and PL lifetime) of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs are consistent with reported   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell  coated type II  $\\mathrm{CdSe/TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs.  However, it should  be noted that a trace amount of water during the calcination  process can react with the corners and edges of the nanocubes  as indicated by the rounded shape of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   within the  core/shell NCs.  These surface reactions could generate surface defect and contribute to the decreased PL intensity.  \n\nThe charge transport properties of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs  were further tested by photo electrochemical study. A smaller  semicircle arc and a greatly reduced recombination rate at  high frequencies for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs from electro chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (in the form of  Nyquist plots, Figure 5d) was observed, demonstrating that  the charge transfer resistance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs is significantly  decreased upon the formation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell  NCs.  This result was further confirmed by transient photocurrent responses which shows that the assembled   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs demonstrate an enhanced cathodic  photo current,  ${\\approx}2$   times larger, compared to the dried   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    NC powder in 0.1  m    $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{4}$   aqueous solution   $(\\mathrm{pH}=6.8\\$  , upon  irradiation by 405 LED light) at an applied potential of   $-0.1\\mathrm{~V~}$    versus NHE (Figure 5e). Meanwhile, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  core/ shell NCs maintained a relatively constant photo current within  the   $^{\\textrm{\\scriptsize8h}}$   test considering the contribution of the dark current  effect (Figure 5f), indicating excellent stability in real photoelectric test condition in water. To show the contribution of dark  current, we conducted a light on/off measurement after the  6 h photo current measurement. As shown in Figure 5f, there  is a small increase of dark current (shown in stars in Figure 5f)  compared to that of starting time of illumination, which contribute to the small increase of the total current density.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/3efc5a65bccd05a0950f0b3c1d25ba9c9b59f15fa20389121e99915275915e89-1723826845.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   NC powder and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   NCs after calcination at  $300~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $5\\,\\mathsf{h}$  ; b) Steadystate PL spectra of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   powder and  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}\\,\\mathsf{N C s};\\mathsf{c})$  ) Time-resolved PL spectra of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   powder and  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  NCs; d) Electrochemical  impedance spectra (Nyquist plot) of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   powder and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}\\;\\mathsf{N C}$  s, inset is the equivalent circuit model and  $Z^{\\prime}$   and   $-Z^{\\prime\\prime}$   are the virtual and  real impedances, respectively; e) Transient photo current responses to on-off illumination of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   powder and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   NCs electrodes at   $-0.1$   V versus NHE in neutral water (0.1  m    $\\mathsf{N a}_{2}\\mathsf{S O}_{4}$  ,   $\\mathsf{p H}=6.8,$  );  $\\mathsf{f})$   Controlled potential electrolysis of the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   NCs electrode in neutral water  within  $8~\\mathsf{h}$  .

Conclusions  \n\nIn summary, we have developed a facial method for the  coating of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs, which can serve as  an efficient protective layer for   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs. The resulting   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs are ultra stable and exhibit excellent water stability for more than 12 weeks with size, morphology, and crystal lin it y unchanged along with the added  protection against anion exchange and photo degradation. Furthermore, the encapsulating   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs into the electrical  conductive thin layer   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell allows for efficient photo­ induced charge transfer and enhanced photoelectric activity in  real water testing. This work would provide new opportunities  for the design and utilization of perovskite NCs as a visiblelight photo catalyst for solar energy conversion in aqueous  solution.  \n\n# 4.
