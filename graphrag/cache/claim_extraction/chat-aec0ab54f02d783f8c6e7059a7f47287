Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The ionic-liquid additive was synthesized by reacting   $\\mathsf{I0~m L}$   of   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{2}$   (  $40\\%$   in methanol, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Japan) and   $5~\\mathsf{m L}$   of acetic acid   $(99\\%$  , Aldrich) with   $50~\\mathsf{m L}$   of ethanol as solvent  in a   $250\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$   round-bottom flask at room temperature for   $^{\\mathrm{~2~h~}}$   with  stirring. The solvent as well as excess reactant was removed by vacuum  overnight, resulting in a colorless and viscous liquid. It was further dried  by solid desiccant (silica gel) and in vacuum oven for   $24\\,\\mathsf{h}$  .  \n\nDevice Fabrication : Devices were prepared on cleaned and patterned  FTO substrates. The NiO-based HELs were prepared by a spray pyrolysis  method:  a solution containing   $20\\,\\times\\,10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$   nickel acetyl ace to nate,   $3.75\\times10^{-3}$    m  magnesium acetate tetra hydrate, and   $1.25\\times10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$   lithium  acetate in acetonitrile/ethanol (with 95: 5 volume ratio) was sprayed on  clean FTO substrates (Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) at   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   using  air as a carrier gas. The NiO films were at subsequently annealed on a  hotplate in air at   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$  . The perovskite layer was deposited  by simple one step spin-coating method in a nitrogen filled glovebox.  The   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   precursor solution is comprised of   $1.2~\\mathrm{M}$   MAI and   $1.2~\\mathrm{~M~}$     ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   in super dehydrated DMF. The additives   $(\\approx]0–]5\\%$   MAAc,   $3{-}5\\%$    th io semi carb azide, molar ratio) were dissolved in DMF and added into  the perovskite solution just before spin-coating. The precursor solution  was spin-cast onto the substrate at 3000 rpm for   $2~\\mathsf{m i n}$  , followed by a  thermal annealing at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$  . The perovskite films for optical  and XRD measurements were prepared on clean glass slides with the  same procedure. The n-type contact layer   $(\\approx\\!80\\ \\mathsf{n m})$   was form by spincoating a PCBM solution   $(20\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$   in chl oro benzene) at 1000 rpm  for  $30~\\mathrm{s}$  . The subsequent deposition of very thin titanium oxide interlayer  was similar to the previous report.  Finally, a   $200\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   thick   $\\mathsf{A g}$   was  deposited under high vacuum   $\\left(<3\\times\\mathsf{10^{-4}}\\ \\mathsf{P a}\\right)$  . The solar cell was sealed  by UV glue coating on a cavity glass which covered between the front  FTO glass and the active films.  \n\nCharacterization : The top-view SEM images were obtained by using  a JSM–6500F field-emission scanning electron microscope. The crosssectional SEM was taken by SU8220 (Hitachi High-Technologies  Corporation), and EDS mapping images were measured from XFlash   $5060F Q$   (Bruker AXS). The cross-sectional observation samples were  prepared by IM4000 Ion Milling System (Hitachi High-Technologies  Corporation). The XRD was measured on Rigaku RINT-2500 powder  X-ray diffract o meter using   ${\\mathsf{C u}}\\ {\\mathsf{K}}_{\\upalpha}$  radiation. The UV–vis spectra were  measured on a Shimadzu UV/vis 3600 spectrophotometer. The  static photo luminescence spectra were measured by Edinburgh PLS  920 (Edinburgh Co. Ltd.). The time-resolved photo luminescence decay  was measured by Horiba Fluorolog-3 Time Correlated Single Photon  Counting system with excitation wavelength at   $460\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m}$  . The timeintegrated photo luminescence spectra of the samples were collected  with a miniature spectrometer   $({\\sf U S B}2000\\ +\\ {\\sf U V}.$  –vis, Ocean Optics).  For the excitation power-dependent measurement, the samples were  excited at   $540~\\mathsf{n m}$   (150 fs,  $80~{\\sf M H z})$  ) by excited at  $540~\\mathsf{n m}$   pulses from a  Chemeleon Compact OPO system. The excitation fluence on the sample  was in the range from 10 nJ   $\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   to   $2~\\upmu\\mathrm{J~cm}^{-2}$   per pulse. The densities  of the surface traps and bulk traps of each film were estimated by  analyzing the dependence of the TIPL on the pump fluence according to  literature.  The current–voltage characteristics were measured using a  solar simulator with standard air mass 1.5 sunlight (  $100\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  , WXS155S-10: Wacom Denso Co., Japan) under ambient conditions. The  $J^{-V}$  curves were measured by forward   $(-0.2$   to  $1.2\\,\\lor$   forward bias) or reverse  (1.2 to  $-0.2\\;\\lor$  ) scans. The step voltage was fixed at   $10\\ \\mathsf{m V}$  and the delay  time was set at   $100\\ \\mathsf{m s}$  .  $J^{-V}$  curves for all devices were measured by  masking the cells with a metal mask. Monochromatic IPCE spectra were  measured with a monochromatic incident light of  $\\rceil\\times\\rceil0^{\\rceil6}$   photons  $\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  in director current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki). The light intensity  of the solar simulator was calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell  provided by PV Measurements Inc. The stable photo current and power  output were measured by an electrochemical station (Solartron 1287).  The light-soaking stability was tested on a solar-cell light resistance test  system (Model BIR - 50, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., LTD) equipped with a Class  AAA solar simulator;   ${<\\!420\\,\\textrm{\\textmu}\\!\\mathrm{U}\\!\\mathrm{V}}$   light was cut off with an optical  filter, and a Keithley 2401 Source Meter for automatically recording the   $J^{-V}$  curves. The thermal stability was tested in an electronic constant  temperature/humidity chamber (THR030FA, Advantec Co., Ltd.) with  controlled humidity at  ${<}20\\%$   and temperature at  $85~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.W., F.X., and H.C. contributed equally to this work.
