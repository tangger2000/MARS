Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

It is well known that the trap  density levels are continuously filled in the trap-filled limited  region and all the traps are filled until trap-filled limit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$   as bias increases. The trap density can be calculated  using an equation of   $n_{\\mathrm{t}}=(2\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}})/(e L^{2})$  , where   $\\varepsilon$  is the dielectric constants of perovskite,   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity,  e is the elementary charge, and   $L$   is the thickness of perovskite  film.   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is obtained by fitting the dark   $I{-}V$  curves. The  dielectric constant of the perovskite is calculated according to   $\\varepsilon=(C_{\\mathrm{g}}L)/(\\varepsilon_{0}A),^{[37]}$   where   $C_{\\mathrm{g}}$  is the geometrical capacitance of  perovskite layer,   $L$   is the thickness of the perovskite film, and  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/33fb34b9001c58e9341266addb065acbb603dbe8cb0956ea2f110ca0e8f7a21c-1723834540.jpg)  \nFigure 5.   Dark   $I{-}V$  curves of electron-only devices: a)  $\\mathsf{F T O}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/$  perovskite/PCBM/Ag and b)   $\\mathsf{F T O}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -IL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag.   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -IL stands for  the ImAcHCl modified   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  . c)  $V_{\\mathrm{{oc}}}$   versus light intensity plots of PSCs based on  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -IL. d) Nyquist plots of the PSCs based on   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2^{-}}|\\mathsf{L}$  , obtained with a bias of   $0.6~\\forall$   in the frequency range of 1 MHz to   $0.1\\ \\mathsf{H}z$   under 1 sun illumination. The equivalent circuit used for fitting is  illustrated in the inset. e) Charge transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$   and   $\\mathsf{f})$   recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$   as a function of applied voltage, extracted from the  Nyquist plots.  \n\nthe  $A$   is the active areas of the electron-only device.    $C_{\\mathrm{g}}$   is  obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of device   $\\mathrm{FTO}/\\$  perovskite/Au. After modification of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   with ImAcHCl, the  defect density of perovskite film is reduced from   $5.96\\times10^{15}$   to   $3.17\\times10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . In addition, from the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   versus light intensity measurement in Figure  5c, the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL device shows  much lower slope   $(1.51\\ k T/q)$   as compared to the control device \n\n  $\\left(1.98\\,\\,\\,k T/q\\right)$  . Since the deviation of the slope from unity   $k T/q$  (where  $k$   is the Boltzmann constant,   $T$  stands for the absolute  temperature and   $q$   represents the elementary charge) reflects  trap-assisted non radiative recombination (Shockley–Read– Hall (SRH)) in PSCs,  the lower value estimated for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}\\mathrm{{-}I L}}$   is indicative of reduced trap-assisted non radiative  recombination. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement has been extensively employed  to gain deep insight into inter facial charge transfer and rec ombination.  Nyquist plots of the devices with and  without ImAcHCl modification were measured under a bias of   $0.6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   in the frequency range of   $1\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$   to   $0.1\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$   under one  sun illumination at room temperature (Figure 5d). Two semicircles are clearly observed. It was reported that the semicircle  in the high-frequency region is closely related with the charge  transfer and transportation resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$   and the semicircle  in the low-frequency region is put down to recombination  resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$  .  As shown in Figure  S13 in the Supporting Information, series resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{s}})$   is slightly increased  after modification with ImAcHCl pas siva ting layer. Figure 5e,f  shows the   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$   and   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   as a function of applied voltages, where  the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -IL device exhibits reduced   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$   and increased   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   as  compared to those for the control device. This indicates that  electron extraction is improved and interface recombination is  reduced by the introduction of ImAcHCl on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  .  \n\nDevice stability is compared, where   $J{-}V$  curves are measured under the ambient condition with relative humidity  ranging between  $40\\%$   and   $60\\%$  . Considering the poor thermal  stability of spiro-MeOTAD-based PSCs,  we replace spiroMeOTAD with poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) especially for  investigating thermal stability. The un encapsulated devices  with or without ImAcHCl modification are heated at   $85\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  in the dark in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. As can be seen  in Figure S14 in the Supporting Information,   $90\\%$   of its initial PCE is maintained for the ImAcHCl-modified device  after   $40\\textrm{h}$   aging, while PCE is degraded by   $53\\%$   for the control device.  Figure    6  shows the moisture stability of devices   $(\\mathrm{FTO}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   or   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -IL/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au) stored  in the ambient condition in the dark at room temperature.  The un encapsulated device with ImAcHCl treatment retains   $94\\%$   of its initial PCE after 35 days, while the control device  maintains only   $79\\%$   of its initial PCE. Reduced interface  defects and thereby reduced interface non radiative recombination could be one of the main reasons for the improvement  of thermal and moisture endurance. The improved stability  by multi functional ImAcHCl linker is probably due to the  reduced interface defects.  \n\nChemical linker with desired functions was found to improve  photovoltaic performance, reduce current–voltage hysteresis,  and enhance stability in perovskite solar cell. ImAcHCl can provide a chemical bridge between   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and perovskite through  an ester bond with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   via an esterification reaction between  carboxylic acid in ImAcHCl and hydroxyl group in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/e30b87f3435eebaa9382a7ebe5df37d42b15c4e1c737fb0450dad4c43c296eaf-1723834534.jpg)  \nFigure 6.  $J_{\\mathsf{s c}},$   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$  , c) FF, and d) PCE of the un encapsulated PSCs with the unmodified  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and the ImAcHCl modified   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   $(\\mathsf{S n O}_{2^{\\cdot}}\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
