Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The light green, gray, and  purple spheres represent Cs, Pb, and I atoms, respectively.  \n\nthe dark  $I{-}V$   curves of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  –OTG3-based devices,  which include an Ohmic regime, a trap-filled limited regime  and a trap-free space charge limited current (SCLC) regime.  The trap density can be deduced from the onset voltage of the  trap-filled limit region (  $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$  , as depicted in Equation (1):  \n\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{trap}}=\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}{q l^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity,   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   is the relative dielectric  constant,   $q$   is the charge constant, and  l  is the thickness of the  perovskite film. It is found that the trap density significantly  decreases from   $2.02\\times10^{16}$   to   $8.75\\times10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   for the control  and passivated devices, which is in consistent with the XPS  analysis.  \n\nFigure  4c displays the steady-state photo luminescence (PL)  spectrum of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   perovskite films coated  on bare glass. The fact that the PL intensity of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$  was much higher and that the PL peaks were slightly blue  shifted (from 722 to   $719\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) indicated that pass iv ation of surface electronic trap states had occurred.  Furthermore, the fact  that PL quenching of the PCBM-coated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   film changed  very little after the pass iv ation process (Figure S11, Supporting  Information) implied that the surface-capping OTG3 molecules  did not affect the interface charge extraction efficiency of the  charge-transporting layer.

Three regions can be identified based on the slope   $(n)$   of the curve:   $n=1$   is the Ohmic region,  $n=2$   is the SCLC region  (child), and  $n>3$   is the trap-filled limited region (TFL). c) Steady-state photo luminescence spectrums and d) time-resolved PL decays for the  $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{3}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{O T G}3$   films.

The PL decay  curves were fitted with a double exponential equation, and the  parameters derived from the curves are summarized in Table S1  (Supporting Information). The results showed that the fast  decay lifetime   $(\\tau_{1})$   that accounts for bio molecular recombination of photo generated free carriers was not obviously changed,  but the slow decay lifetime   $(\\tau_{2})$   relative to the trap-assisted  recombination exhibited a much higher value (81.7 ns) for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   perovskite than for pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   (47.4  ns).  This enhanced PL lifetime suggests that there was less nonradiative recombination and a lower trap density in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3^{-}}$  OTG3 perovskite films.  \n\nTo further study the effect of surface organic terminal groups  on the photovoltaic performance of the device, we fabricated  perovskite solar cells with an inverted planar structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass/PTAA/  $\\mathsf{\\check{C}s P b I_{3}}$   perovskite  (without or with OTG molecules)/PCBM/BCP/Ag ( Figure    5 a).  Table S2 and Figure S12 (Supporting Information) list the statistic distribution of corresponding photovoltaic parameters   $(J_{\\mathrm{sc}},\\ \\ V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   FF, and PCE) of the devices with different molar  ratios of OTG3 to   $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$   in the precursor solution (12 devices  in a batch), and the characteristic   $J{-}V$  curves are plotted in  Figure S13 (Supporting Information). As the OTG3 molar ratio  was increased from   $0.1\\%$   to   $1\\%$  , the PCE first increased and  then decreased. The best cell efficiency occurred at a molar ratio  of   $0.2\\%$  . Figure  5b shows the   $J{-}V$  curves of the best devices  based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   perovskite. The control  devices gave a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.07\\mathrm{~V},$   a  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $15.85\\ \\mathrm{mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , a fill factor  (FF) of   $68.52\\%$  , and a PCE of   $11.62\\%$  . The performance of the  PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   was an enormous improvement  over the performance of the control device; the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   was   $1.12~\\mathrm{V},$  the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   was   $15.81\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , the FF was   $75.19\\%$  , and the PCE was   $13.32\\%$  . To increase the accuracy of photovoltaic measurement,  we perform the hysteresis analysis of PSCs based on different  scan directions (Figure S14, Supporting Information), both the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   devices show a negligible hysteresis  between forward and reverse scan. The cross-section SEM image  of the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device is shown in Figure S15  (Supporting Information). We attributed the enhancements  of the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and FF of the CsPbI 3 –OTG3 PSCs to the efficient  pass iv ation of surface electronic trap states caused by the  under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   defects, which effectively reduced the  energy loss due to non radiative recombination of the charge  carrier.  \n\nTo ensure the reliability of the performance of the device,  we measured the steady-state PCE for about 600 s under a constant bias of   $0.88~\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
