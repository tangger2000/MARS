Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In contrast,   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs show  much better stability and can maintain   ${\\approx}80\\%$   of the initial PL  intensity for 180 days, which indicates that the cubic structure  is very stable. Figure  3b shows the photographs of fresh and  180 days aged   ${C18}{\\cdot}{C}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   and  $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs, which provide direct evidence for the stability discrepancy between them.  Moreover, XRD was carried out to provide direct insight into  the phase changing of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   QDs, as shown in Figure 3c,d.  For  $\\mathsf{C18{\\cdot}C s P b I}_{3}$  QDs, the QD solution turns into yellow color after 60 days, which shows a completely ortho rhombi c phase  (Figure  3c). In contrast, the   $_{\\textrm{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}}$   QDs maintained  pure cubic phase after 180 days, which further confirms the  enhanced phase stability of   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs. In short, the  weak  $E_{\\mathrm{ads}}$   value for the C18 ligands causes them to be lost easily,  which might introduce new surface defects. As a result, the fast  PL decline and phase transition are unavoidable ( Figure   4 a). In  contrast, the presence of C8 ligands with stronger   $E_{\\mathrm{ads}}$   could  promote the long-term stability of surface ligands, which  results in fewer new surface defects, higher PLQY, and better   $\\alpha$  phase stabilization, as shown in Figure 4b.  \n\nLikewise, the roles of C8 and C18 ligands in synthesizing the  QDs were also studied. When only C8 was used as a ligand,  the  $\\mathrm{C8{-}C s P b I_{3}}$   product cannot dissolve in hexane and presented  as precipitate with dark red color. TEM images suggest that  the   $\\mathrm{C8{-}C s P b I_{3}}$   nano crystals have much larger size than that of   ${\\mathsf{C18}}{\\cdot}{\\mathsf{C s P b I}}_{3}$   or   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs (about   $50~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  ) and form a  layered structure ( Figure    5 a,b). Unexpectedly, these nanocrystals still retain their cubic structure (Figure  5c,d), i.e., the  structure remains cubic even though C8 can lead to a morphology change in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   nano crystals. More importantly,  the precipitate shows strong PL emission that persists for  approximately 60 days (Figure 5d insert). The lower stability of   $\\mathrm{C8{-}C s P b I_{3}}$   nano crystals than that of   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs can  be ascribed to the relative large crystal size and poor dispersibility of   $\\mathrm{C8{-}C s P b I_{3}}$   nano crystals, which might result in their  aggregation as time goes on. Protesescu et  al. suggested that  the size reduction is exceedingly important for stabilizing the  cubic phase of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  .  Therefore, the phase transition would  gradually take place with the size increasing of   $\\mathsf{C8}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$    nano crystals. In contrast,  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   QDs with uniform morphologies consisting of cubic shapes with average size of   $9.86\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    can be received when C8 and C18 were used as ligands, which  could keep the QDs from aggregation. Compared to C8, C18, or   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   nano crystals, one can see that C18 is necessary to successfully synthesize   $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs as it preserves  their morphology and promotes dispersion of QDs in common  solvents.  \n\nIn order to find out the relationship between the stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   QDs and the length of ligands, other ligands, e.g., acetic  acid/ethylamine (C2), butyric acid/butylamine (C4), caproic  acid/hexylamine (C6), capric acid/decylamine (C10), and dodecanoic acid/do dec yl amine (C12), were also used to synthesize  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/8eab557f0797bc9f4474654600d7ed9c65b3e0f64a84811999745279392fd622-1723828401.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   a) PL st abilities of different QDs. b) Photographs of the as-prepared QD samples and samples aged for 180 days.

First, several shorter-chain ligands, which  are C2, C4, and C6, were employed for the preparation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   QDs. However, none of them (no PL can be observed for  C2 based product) could result in stable samples in nonpolar  (such as hexane, octane, toluene, etc.) or polar solvent (such as  ethanol, methanol, acetone, etc.). We believe that the reason for  their poor st abilities should be attributed to the polarity of these  ligands, i.e., the ligands themselves would promote the phase  transition of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  . Therefore, the poor st abilities of   $\\mathrm{C}2/\\mathrm{C}4/$   $\\mathsf{C6-C s P b I}_{3}$   nano crystals should be contributed to the ligands  rather than the solvent. Subsequently, longer-chain ligands,  which are C8, C10, and C12, were employed for the preparation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   QDs. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowl- edge,   $\\mathrm{C8{-}C s P b I_{3}}$   nano crystals still cannot be well dispersed in  any kind of low-polar organic solvent (hexane, octane, toluene,  methyl acetate, ether, benz yl amine, ph en ethyl amine, benzoic acid, benzaminic acid, etc.), and will lose PL activity after  mixing with polar solvent (ethanol, methanol,  N , N -dimethyl formamide, water, acetonitrile, etc.). Interestingly, the   $\\mathrm{C8{-}C s P b I_{3}}$  nano crystals have dark red color and red PL that persist for  approximately 60 days. In contrast,   $C12{\\cdot}C\\mathrm{s}P\\mathrm{b}I_{3}$   nano crystals  have better solubility in hexane but lower stability. (We had also  used C10 as ligands to synthesize   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   QDs, unfortunately,  the product showed no PL activity (the reason is still unclear).)  These results indicate that the chain length have great influence on the stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   nano crystals. For C2, C4, C6, C8,  and C12, the polarities of these ligands will decrease with the  increasing of chain length. In addition, larger polarity means:  a) stronger adsorption energy between those ligands and Cs, Pb, \nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
