Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

All the samples were stored  in sealed flasks under dark conditions in air at room temperature with  a humidity of   $45–55\\%$   to examine their st abilities. The photo current  density–voltage   $(J-V)$   curves of the as-fabricated solar cells were  recorded with a Keithley 2400 semiconductor characterization  system (Keithley Instruments, USA) during illumination with a solar  simulator (Newport 91160, 300 W xenon lamp, USA), which employed  a mono crystalline silicon cell system (Oriel, USA) as a reference to  calibrate the output light intensity. The SPO data were measured at a  constant voltage corresponding to the voltage at the highest PCE value  in the   $J^{-V}$  curve (0.71 and   $0.79~\\lor$  respectively) during continuous illumination (1 sun). The EQE was  determined with Newport’s EQE Measurement Kit. A 300 W Xe lamp  with a monochromator was used to produce monochromatic light. EIS  spectra were gathered using an Auto lab PG STAT 320 N electrochemical  workstation at   $0.9\\;\\forall$   bias in darkness.  \n\nComputational Methods : The DFT calculations were performed using  the Dmol 3  4.4 program. The generalized gradient approximation with  the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional was employed for geometric  optimization. A grid with   $3\\,\\times\\,3\\,\\times\\,7$   k-points was used for Brillouinzone integration. In addition, the inner electrons of Cs, Pb, and I  atoms were kept frozen and substituted by effective core potentials;  this approximation was not applied to the other atoms during these  calculations. A Fermi smearing of 0.005 Hartree was used to accelerate  convergence, and the real-space cutoff was set to   $6.2\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  in order to  improve the computational performance. In addition, the tolerances  on energy, force, and displacement convergence were set to   $\\rceil\\times\\rceil0^{-5}$  Hartree,   $2\\times\\mathsf{I}0^{-3}$   Hartree  $\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{-1}$  , and   $5\\times10^{-3}\\,\\bar{\\mathsf{A}},$  , respectively.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation  of China (nos. 11674258, 51602305, 51702219), International Science  & Technology Cooperation Program of China (no. 2013 DFR 50710),  the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities   (no. 2017II22GX), the Nature Science Foundation of Guangdong  Province  (no.  2018A030313401),  the  Science  and  Technology  Innovation Commission of Shenzhen (nos.
