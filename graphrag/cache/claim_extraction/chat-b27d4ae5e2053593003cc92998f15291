Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It can clearly  be seen in these figure (see Figures S1â€“S3, Supporting Information for magnified images) that unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals are formed  on S-3 films. From the XRD patterns, an additional peak at   $12.5^{\\circ}$  was observed in S-3 films, which was assigned to the   $(0\\;0\\;l)$   plane  of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals.  All the other peaks originated from the  cubic perovskite structure (FigureÂ 1dâ€“f) .  This may suggest that  the white particles in FigureÂ 1c are  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals.  \n\nNext, we fabricated an initial batch of planar PSCs with S-1,  S-2, or S-3 films to investigate their performance. The schematic  PSC structure is shown in FigureÂ 1g. Detailed device fabrication methods are summarized in the experimental section. Cur- rent densityâ€“voltage   $(J-V)$   characteristics of PSCs with S-1, S-2,  or S-3 films are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information),  and solar cell parameters estimated from this figure are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). In this batch,  the S-2 devices had the highest PCE with the maximum value  of   $19.01\\%$  . However, the differences in PCE among the S-1, S-2,  or S-3 devices were smaller than the deviation, which means  that the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   concentrations in the precursor solutions had  little influence on the initial PCEs. PSCsâ€™ statistics is shown  in FigureÂ 1h, with the average PCEs being   $17.3\\%$  ,   $17.6\\%$  , and   $16.9\\%$   for S-1, S-2, and S-3 devices, respectively. After the initial  screening, we chose to make an additional batch using the S-2  solution because this S-2 solution provided the slightly higher  average efficiency. The   $J{-}V$   curves from the second batch of  S-2 PSCs are shown in FigureÂ 1i. The second batch was fabriÂ­ cated after additional optimization (see the Experimental  Section for the optimization details).

The inset  of FigureÂ 1i shows the statistics of these devices fabricated in  the same batch. All of the devices had PCEs above   $18.9\\%$   with  the average value   ${>}20\\%$  . The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the champion S-2 device is shown in Figure S5  (Supporting Information).  \n\nFigure Â   2 a shows the PCE evolution of PSCs, which were  fabricated in the first batch with the different concentrations  of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and operated under continuous illumination with a  light intensity of   $100\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}}$   (1 sun). The S-1 and S-2 PSCs  retained   $92\\%$   and   $99\\%$   of their initial PCEs after   $520\\textrm{h}$   of continuous illumination, respectively. On the contrary, the PCE of  the S-3 PSCs decreased to   $47\\%$   of its initial value. We believe  that this quick degradation of the S-3 PSCs was caused by the  presence of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals in the perovskite films. Detailed evolutions of   $J_{S C}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  , and FF are shown in Figure S6 (Supporting  Information).  \n\nTo further investigate the degradation associated with  unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , we performed morphological character iz ations on S-3 films and devices as shown in FigureÂ 2bâ€“d.
