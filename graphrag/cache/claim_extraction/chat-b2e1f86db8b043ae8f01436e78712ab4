Strategies to Increase the Diffusion Length  \n\nMixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide per ovsk ites have shorter carrier diffusion  lengths and lower absorption coefficients compared with the  lead halide per ovsk ites, which limit the performance of   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$  based PSCs. Recently, GuaSCN was used to lower the defect  density, which led to a long carrier lifetime beyond   $1~\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   and  increased the diffusion length to   $2.5~\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$  . With   $7\\%$   GuaSCN  addition, the densities of small grains and pinholes were substantially reduced, and grain boundaries became more compact (Figure  7b). The PCE improved from   $15.3\\%$   to   $18.4\\%$  (Figure 7b). The best PCE reached   $20.5\\%$   for reverse scans.
