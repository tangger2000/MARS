to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

However, the aged device with TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL  exhibits the weakest accumulation of iodine ions at the PCBM/ Ag interface compared to the aged devices without CBL and  with   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL, which contributes to the improved operational stability.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   is first developed as cathode buffer  layer (CBL) for high-performance inverted PVSCs. TBAB is  attached to   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   surface mainly through the electrostatic  interaction between the negative-charged surface of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  and the   $\\mathrm{TBA^{+}}$  . The partial charge of TBAB is transferred  from   $_\\mathrm{N}$   atom to Br atom and then to the   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  surface and  meanwhile the charge transfer brings about molecular dipole  moment in the   $_z$  -axis direction, so TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   shows a significantly reduced WF of   $3.9\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   and increased electrical conductivity compared to   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  . The TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  CBL can  enable optimization of energy level alignment and enhancement of charge extraction and moreover effectively inhibit the  migration of iodine ions from perovskite layer to   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   cathode,  which synergistic ally suppresses defect states and reduce  charge recombination. Therefore, the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device  shows a slightly increased PCE  .74%) compared to the control  device   $(16.25\\%)$  ), while the TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device exhibits a  dramatically improved PCE   $(21.65\\%)$   with significantly reduced  hysteresis behavior. Moreover, the optimal PCE of the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device also outperforms that of the BCP based  device   $(19.94\\%)$   in this work and other previously reported  devices based on   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbI}_{3}/\\mathrm{PCBM}$   with different CBLs. In addition, the TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device still retains   $88\\%$   and   $85\\%$  of the initial PCE after air exposure for   $100\\mathrm{~h~}$   and continuous  thermal annealing   $(85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   for  $100\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$  , respectively, exhibiting significantly better operational stability compared to the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  based device (separately retaining   $70\\%$   and   $50\\%$   of the initial  PCE) and the control device (separately retaining   $57\\%$   and   $18\\%$   of the initial PCE). The results indicate that TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  should be a very promising CBL for high-performance inverted  PVSCs and will inspire the further applications of quaternary  ammonium functional i zed MXenes in PVSCs.  \n\n# 4.

The suspension  was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to remove the excessive TBAB,  and then the TBAB $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{i}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  product was taken into ethanol   $(30\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu})$  and sonicated in ice bath for   $2~\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
