Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

More importantly, the carrier  diffusion length in  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   can be as large  as   $9.2\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   with extremely high charge  mobility   $(\\approx\\!4500\\ \\mathrm{\\cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{\\V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{\\s}^{-1})$  .  These  excellent  characteristics  indicate  that   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   is an ideal material for fabricating  high-performance photoelectric devices,  including solar cells.  \n\nCubic phase  $\\mathsf{c s P bI}_{3}$     $(\\alpha{\\tt C S P b l}_{3})$   perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have received  extensive attention due to their all-inorganic composition and suitable  band gap (1.73Â eV). However,   $\\pmb{\\alpha}\\pmb{\\cdot}\\pmb{\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{3}}$   QDs might convert to   $\\delta{\\tt C s P b l}_{3}$    (ortho rhombi c phase with indirect band gap of 2.82Â eV) due to easy loss of  surface ligands. In addition, commonly used long-chain ligands (oleic acid,  OA, and oleylamine, OLA) hinder efficient charge transport in op to electronic  devices. In order to relieve these drawbacks, OA, OLA, octanoic acid, and  octylamine are used as capping ligands for synthesizing high-quality  $\\pmb{\\alpha}\\pmb{\\cdot}\\pmb{\\mathsf{C s P b l}}_{3}$    QDs. The results indicate that these QDs exhibit excellent optical properties  and long-term stability compared to QDs capped only with OA and OLA.  Moreover, QDs with shorter ligands exhibit an enhanced charge transport  rate, which improves the power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices  from  $\\mathbf{7.76\\%}$   to   $\\pmb{11.87\\%}$  .  \n\nMeanwhile, compared to organicâinorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs),  in which the power conversion efficiency  (PCE) can reach up to   $23.6\\%$  ,  the PCE  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  -based PSCs is much lower   due to their phase transitions. For  instance, the A-site cation   $\\left(\\mathrm{Cs}^{+}\\right)$   in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$    is too small to keep lead iodide octahedral  in a 3D perovskite framework, resulting  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nin spontaneous phase transition into the ortho rhombi c phase   $(\\delta{\\mathrm{-}}{\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{PbI}}_{3}$  , indirect band gap of   $2.82\\;\\mathrm{\\eV}$  ) at room temperature.  This phase has much larger band gap and poor photoÂ­ physical properties. One promising method to address the  above issue is to synthesize   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   quantum dots (QDs), which  have higher surface-to-volume ratio and lower surface energy  than the corresponding stable phase.  The unique surface state and surface ligands on these QDs co-preserve the  phase stability of   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  . Nevertheless, oleic acid (OA) and  oleylamine (OLA) are commonly used as ligands, which are  highly dynamic and easily lost. This ligand loss could result in  a phase transformation to   $\\delta{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  .  Moreover, OA and OLA  are long-chain organic ligands (both contain 18 carbon atoms),  which are undesirable for fast charge transport and fabrication  of high-performance photovoltaic devices.  Therefore, surface ligand engineering is critical if phase stable   $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs  and efficient solar cells are to be obtained.  Till now, most of  the works are focusing on the substitution of one kind of ligand  (OA or OLA), how to replace both of them is still rare.  \n\nNowadays,  all-inorganic  per ovsk ites,  especially   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$     $\\mathrm{(X\\,=\\,Cl}$  , Br, or I), are receiving increased attention due to  their better stability in ambient environment compared to  organicâinorganic hybrid per ovsk ites (such as   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbX}_{3}$    or   $\\mathrm{(NH_{2})_{2}C H P b X_{3}}$  ).  Moreover, surface defects on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$    quantum dots (QDs) have negligible influence on their physical properties, thus minimizing the charge carrier trapping  caused by surface trap states.  Therefore, the photo lu minescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these materials can easily reach  up to   $90\\%$   with narrow emission bandwidth (ranging from  \n\nIn this contribution, we co-employed OA/OLA (C18) and  octanoic acid (OctAc)/octylamine (OctAm) (C8) as capping  ligands for synthesizing high-quality   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs. The results  suggest that C8/C18 co-capped   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$     $(\\mathrm{C8/C18{\\cdot}C s P b I_{3}})$  ) QDs  exhibit much better cubic phase stability   $(>\\!180$   days) compared  to C18 capped QDs (C18-CsPbI 3 ) in solution. In addition, the  PLQY of our   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs reached up to   $94\\%$  , which  was higher than the PLQY value from   $\\mathsf{C18{-}C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs   $(80\\%)$  .  Theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced stability and  PLQY could be due to stronger adsorption energy between the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   surface and C8 compared to that of C18.
