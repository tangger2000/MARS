Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In comparison, the devices based on  PEDOT:PSS exhibit a   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $15.2\\mathrm{\\mA^{-2}}$   and a lower   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.15\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   as well as a lower   $F F$   of   $68.5\\%$  , hence a lower PCE of   $12\\%$  . The   $0.11\\;\\mathrm{~V~}$   improvement in   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   from PEDOT:PSS to  TPE-S could be attributed to the lower-lying HOMO level of  TPE-S, while the reduction in leakage current and recombination could be responsible for improved  FF . Moreover, TPE-Sbased devices demonstrate good reproducibility and little hysteresis (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information shows the  statistical histogram and forward scan  $J{-}V$   curves).  \n\nThe external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the champion TPE-S-based and PEDOT:PSS-based cells are presented  in FigureÂ  2b in which the integrated   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   values match those  from the   $J{-}V$  measurement. We further investigated the time  dependence of the TPE-S-based devices by monitoring their  power output under the maximum power-point condition.

This low SPO value is potentially due to the photoinduced phase separation of PEDOT:PSS.  In high contrast, the TPE-S-based PVSCs maintain high SPO  with a loss of only   ${\\approx}7\\%$  , which is possibly due to the fewer  defect states inside film and the enhanced phase photostability. Furthermore, we also measured the photo stability of the  devices based on the two different HTMs under the simulated  sunlight for   $400\\mathrm{~h~}$   without encapsulation (FigureÂ 2d). Encouragingly, the TPE-S-based device retains   $82\\%$   of its initial PCE,  while the PEDOT:PSS-based devices show a   $46\\%$   PCE drop.  \n\nTo understand the performance difference caused by the  two different HTMs, we performed both steady-state-photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) experiments to  examine the charge transfer properties at the interface between  perovskite and HTM. As shown in  Figure Â  3 a,b, the PL of CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  film at   $636\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   is quenched effectively by both HTLs.  However, a more efficient PL quenching was observed for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film deposited on the TPE-S layer, indicating that the  TPE-S layer can more efficiently extract holes from the CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film. Moreover, the decline of the PL signal over time for  the TPE-S-based film is faster than the PEDOT:PSS-base film  in the TRPL experiment (FigureÂ 3b). The fitted PL lifetime for  the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film on quartz substrate is about 3.51Â ns,  whereas the PL lifetimes of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films on the PEDOT:PSS  and TPE-S decreased to 1.46 and 0.65Â  ns, respectively. The  more efficient steady-state PL quenching and the faster PL  decay of the perovskite film on TPE-S suggest that hole extraction by TPE-S is more efficient than PEDOT:PSS.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/5e32a426974c01d12fc53cd8aadf747a19a9d372c9106b71830d945a6bc7406b-1723835294.jpg)  \nFigure   4.â€‚  a,b) The contact angles of DMF on PEDOT:PSS (a) and TPE-S (b). c,d) Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of   $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$  film on PEDOT:PSS (c) and TPE-S (d). e) XRD result of   $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films with different HTMs.  \n\nTo understand the pass iv ation effect at the interface between  TPE-S and the perovskite, we performed X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS) experiments. FigureÂ  3c shows that   $\\operatorname{Pb}\\,4\\mathrm{f}$  peaks evidently shift toward lower binding energy compared to  the reference sample. In addition, Figure S8 (Supporting Information) shows that the N 1s peak of TPE-S shifts toward higher  binding energy, indicating that the electron density around   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   is increased and that around   $\\mathrm{N}^{-3}$   is decreased, which disclosed that the electron lone pairs on the N atom could interact  with   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   to form coordination bonds. More importantly,  strong  $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\cal{S}$   and Sâ€“I interactions could also be confirmed from  the observation of a clear shift toward higher binding energy  for   $\\textsl{S2p}$   peaks (FigureÂ 3d), which have been employed to passivate the interface trap states, thereby contributing to the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  enhancement and improving the device performance.  \n\nTo investigate the morphology of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film on the two  different HTM layers, X-ray characterization techniques such  as powder X-ray diffract o meter (XRD) and scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) were employed.

Dramatic difference is found in the SEM images of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films, showing that TPE-S can modulate the crystallinity of the perovskite and facilitate the formation of dense,  high-quality perovskite poly crystalline.
