Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

The insets present the histogram of  J–V  scan efficiencies  for 30 solar cells. The PCE was measured under   $100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   AM 1.5G illumination, which has been corrected by a calibrated Si solar cell. e) The  reverse-scan  J–V  curves of the  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   solar cells based on P3HT and frequently used spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers.

Thus, we derived the valence band maximum \n\n (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) values for \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   as   $-5.58$   and   $-3.76~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively. Similarly, the  highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies for P3HT were estimated to be   $-4.94\\$   and   $-3.04~\\mathrm{eV}.$   The band alignment demonstrates that P3HT acts as a hole-extraction/electron-blocking  layer between the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film and the anode (Figure 5c).  The optimal energy level alignment will provide a driving force  for the hole transfer and prevent electron from flowing in the  opposite direction.  \n\nThe best-performing   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cell completely fabricated and tested under ambient conditions exhibits a high  PCE of   $12.02\\%$   (Figure 5d). This is one of the highest efficiency among inorganic perovskite solar cells reported so  far (Figure S1, Table S1, Supporting Information). The   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  of the best-performing device is   $1.30\\,\\mathrm{~V},$   which is the highest  value among   $\\mathrm{{Cs}P b}(\\mathrm{{I}/B r})_{3}$   solar cells. A high   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}},$   as much as   $1.32\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   has also been achieved (Figure S7, Supporting Information), corresponding to an   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   of only   $0.50~\\mathrm{eV}$   (Figure 1),  demonstrating that the modification of interface with P3HT  facilitates the charge extraction and transportation. The   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  values of solar cells using annealed P3HT hole transport layers  (HTLs) are almost   $0.14\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   higher than that of devices using  spiro-OMeTAD-based HTLs, which further verifies the specific  modification function of P3HT (Figure 5e). This is consistent  with the smaller diode ideality factor   $(n)$   value of P3HT-based  solar cells (Figure S10, Supporting Information).  The photocurrents of our devices show a hysteresis under forward  and reverse scanning directions (Figure S11, Supporting  Information), as has been reported previously for some inorganic perovskite planar he t ero junction solar cells.  Further  \n\nmodification of the cathode/perovskite interface will reduce the  ionic defects in per ovsk ites and thus eliminate the hysteresis  phenomenon.  An average PCE of   $11.2\\%$  from 30 cells is  achieved (Figure 5d, inset). We present the external quantum  efficiency (EQE) between 300 and   $750~\\mathrm{nm}$   in Figure S9a (Supporting Information), and a bandgap of   $1.82~\\mathrm{eV}$   for the CsP $\\mathrm{bl}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film is determined from the EQE spectrum (Figure S9b,  Supporting Information). A stabilized PCE of   $9.50\\%$   and a stabilized short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\right)$   of   $9.60\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   are  achieved under the maximum power point output (Figure S12,  Supporting Information). In addition, the un encapsulated poly­ mer-modified devices exhibit great stability and retain around   $90\\%$   of their initial PCE after   $960\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$   of storage in a dry glovebox  (Figure 5f). Noting that the modest improvements of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and  fill factor (FF) may be attributed to the more sufficient oxidation of P3HT, leading to enhanced p-doping of P3HT and  thus the conductivity.  The photo stability under bias is also  studied, and the light-induced aggravated halide segregation  leads to decrease of the device efficiency (Figure S13, Supporting Information).  \n\nIn conclusion, in setting out to minimize the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   of inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells, we performed a systematic study on the  effects of modifying the interface between  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   absorber and  P3HT hole-acceptor. By pas siva ting the surface defects of CsP $\\mathrm{bl{_2Br}},$  , reducing the energy disorder of P3HT and increasing the  contact area between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and P3HT, we have significantly  reduced the trap states, and facilitated the charge extraction and  transportation, resulting in stable high-performance photovoltaic devices with high   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and low   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   per absorbed photon.  The important point is that our methods are simple and easy,  and even without modifying the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   absorber layer. This  work highlights the potential to achieve more efficient solar cells  through careful optimization of interfaces between each layer.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis of Colloidal   $C s P b I_{2}B r$   NCs : First,   $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{3}$   NCs and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$  NCs were synthesized using a reported procedure.  $0.75~\\mathrm{g}$   of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$  ,   $3\\ \\mathsf{m L}$   of OA, and   $75~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of 1-octadecene (ODE) were added to a   $250~\\mathsf{m L}$  three-necked round bottom flask.
