The introduction of Ti3C2Tx MXene resulted in a smaller over potential of 318 mV to achieve a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm-2, showing a considerable reduction in over potential of 88 mV compared to La0.9Sr0.1CoO3/NF without Ti3C2Tx MXene.<|>The LMN composite can act as a redox-active unit to provide reactions in electrochemical energy conversion. The LMN can be directly used as electrodes for bi functional catalytic reactions. The OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the stoichiometric La1-xSrxCrO3/NF (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) catalysts and the LMN in 1 M KOH were initially evaluated on a three-electrode configuration at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1. For comparison, similar measurements for bare Ni foam, Ti3C2Tx MXene and LSC1 were also performed. The capacitance-corrected cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, polarization curves obtained from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and corresponding Tafel plots were presented. The over potential (η) demanded to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2 is usually served as a reference to assess the effectiveness of electro catalysts to satisfy the requirement of solar-to-fuels conversion. Note that Ti3C2Tx MXene itself showed no redox feature and very poor activity toward OER in alkaline solution. Without the presence of Ti3C2Tx MXene, the La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 (LSC1)/ NF catalysts exhibited a lower over potential (406 mV) than La1-xSrxCrO3/NF (x=0, 0.3, and 0.5) at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 (Figure S7, Supporting Information). After being incorporated with a small amount of Ti3C2Tx MXene, the LMN only required a smaller over potential of 318 mV to achieve a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm-2, showing a considerable reduction in over potential of 88 mV (Figure 2 a; Figure S8, Supporting Information). The enhanced alkaline OER catalytic performance further confirmed that an appropriate addition of low valence ions and 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene was beneficial for the OER performance of La0.9Sr0.1CoO3/NF.<|>##", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1.

In brief, ultrathin   $\\mathrm{La}_{0.9}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.1}\\mathrm{CoO}_{3}$  (LSC1) nanosheet arrays were in situ vertically grown on an  NF via spontaneous electrostatic adsorption effect which provided an excellent electrical attraction to active sites and rapid  mass transfer. The crystal phase and structure of LMN were  confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). All the  diffraction peaks of the   $\\mathrm{La_{0.9}S r_{0.1}C o O_{3}/N i}$   (LSC1/NF) synthesized can be well indexed as the perovskite structure without  the appearance of any impurity phases (Figure  S1, Supporting Information).  Rietveld refinement of the XRD  pattern further revealed that the LMN possessed a hexagonal  phase with an   $\\mathrm{R}.3\\mathrm{m}$   space group (Figure 1b), which was also  directly visualized in parallelogram bright-field scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) image comprised of observable  heavier cations and lighter oxygen. Specifically, SEM images  of the   $\\mathrm{La_{0.9}S r_{0.1}C o O_{3}/T i_{3}C_{2}T_{x}}$   MXene/NF (LMN) composite  revealed distinctive porous nanosheets with pore sizes of several nanometers (Figure 1c,d). As a comparison, the LSC1/NF  annealed at   $600~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   possessed interconnected sheets with hexagonal shapes that were vertically sitting on the surfaces of the  NF (Figure S2, S3, Supporting Information). Whereas the use  of sole   $\\mathrm{La(NO}_{3})_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Sr}(\\mathrm{NO}_{3})_{3}$   or   ${\\mathrm{Co}}({\\mathrm{NO}}_{3})_{2}$   precursor only created  rough chunk surfaces on the NF without any nanosheets, the   $\\mathrm{LSC1/Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  MXene formed the irregular nanosheets after  the introduction of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   MXene (Figures  S4 and S5, Supporting Information). Additionally, the morphology of vertically  distributed catalyst nanosheets changed with the variation in   $\\mathrm{pH}$   of the precursor solution (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Furthermore, TEM images verified the porous structure  of nanosheets (Figure  1e), HRTEM images demonstrated two  different lattice fringes with inter planar distances of 0.27 and   $0.19\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , corresponding to the (110) and (024) crystal planes of  LSC1, respectively (Figure 1f). Elemental mapping validated the  homogeneous distribution of all elements (La, Sr, C, and Ti) in  the LMN (Figure  1g). Overall, the perovskite/  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  MXene  nanosheet array on Ni foam were fabricated successfully, and  the mild fabrication conditions ensured that the catalysts could  be easily prepared on a large scale.  \n\n# 2.2.
