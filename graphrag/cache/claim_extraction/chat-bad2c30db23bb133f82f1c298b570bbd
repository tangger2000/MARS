First, to extend the operational lifetime of PeLEDs, the suitability of strategies to remove the electricfield-induced ion migration should be increased. Although RP MHPs have been studied as a fundamental solution to improve both the EL efficiency and the device stability, the reported operational lifetimes of RP PeLEDs are just several hours, which is much shorter than that of OLEDs. This poor PeLED stability can be ascribed to a lack of understanding of the optimal RP phase; we must determine which chemical structure of large-sized OA is the best for achieving efficient exciton confinement, defect passivation, and prevention of ion migration while retaining moderate charge transport ability. For example, we must first identify the best chemical structure of large OA among aliphatic structures, aromatic structures, and their combinations, and determine the functional groups that can passivate defect sites most efficiently.<|>Study of the passivation of MHP grains is also imperative to improve device stability. To prevent ion migration in PeLEDs based on bulk polycrystalline MHP emission layers (which are formed by the coating of MHP precursor solutions), efficient ion-blocking materials must be developed. Because the MHP grain size in PeLEDs should be decreased to spatially confine charge carriers and thereby enhance radiative recombination, a concomitantly increased grain-boundary area (a main pathway for ion migration) should be passivated with ion-blocking materials. Ideally, these ion-blocking materials should perfectly surround the MHP grains and passivate all the defects at the surface of the MHP grains (or at the grain boundaries) without losing efficient charge injection into the MHP grains. For this purpose, the development of core–shell-type colloidal MHP NPs can also be an effective strategy. These ion-blocking materials or shell materials need not to be insulating; semiconducting materials might be a better choice to improve charge injection and transport in devices.<|>Inspired by the history of OLEDs, vacuum deposition of MHP layers may increase the operational stability of PeLEDs because vacuum deposition may form dense MHP layers. In OLEDs, vacuum deposition yields more dense organic layers with fewer trap states than solution processes do.<|>However, vacuum deposition of MAX is challenging due to a difficulty of the control of the deposition rate. Instead, the vacuum deposition rate of Cs-based MHPs can be controlled more easily due to their high evaporation temperature. Therefore, dual-source deposition of CsX and PbX2 and flash evaporation of CsPbX3 can be promising approaches to fabricate compact CsPbX3 emission layers in PeLEDs.<|>Furthermore, degradation of PeLEDs can be retarded by changing the operation conditions. The use of a pulsed-current-mode operation combined with negative pulses rather than DC-mode operation may improve the device stability of PeLEDs. The pulsed or alternating-current (AC)-mode operation in OLEDs or AC EL devices has been considered to increase the operational lifetime because frequent reversal of the applied voltage can prevent charge accumulation at interfaces in OLEDs, and dielectric layers in AC EL devices (which are absent in DC-driven OLEDs) can suppress side reactions between electrodes and emission layers and block ingress of moisture and oxygen. In PeLEDs or perovskite AC EL devices, the pulsed or AC-mode operation can be more effective to improve device stability than in OLEDs because AC-driven PeLEDs can avoid accumulation of migrated ions (which have escaped from the MHP lattice) at interfaces, and the dielectric layers in perovskite AC EL devices can also block ion migration.<|>For display applications of PeLEDs, red, green, and blue PeLEDs with high efficiency and stability must be realized. The color of PeLEDs can be simply tuned by substitution of halogen anions, but tuning the color with substitution of halogen anions may result in low efficiency of the PeLEDs, especially for blue PeLEDs based on Cl- anions. The low efficiency of blue PeLEDs based on Cl- anions (e.g., CEmax=0.14 cd A-1) is due to the low PLQE and to phase separation caused by migration of halide anions. We suggest that RP MHPs can substantially contribute to the realization of high-efficiency multicolored PeLEDs. In RP MHPs, exciton confinement causes an increase in the bandgap as m decreases, so the blueshift in the emission spectrum can be controlled by adjusting the amount of large OA. For example, CsPbBr3 mixed with 4-phenyl butyl ammonium bromide showed a PL emission peak at 475 nm which is blue shifted by ≈52 nm compared to the peak of 3D CsPbBr3 (527 nm). Therefore, the color of PeLEDs can be further precisely tuned in combination with halide anion substitution. Combined with other advantages such as increased exciton binding energy, reduced trap density, and the ability to prevent ion migration, the color tunability of RP MHPs provides the possibility of high-efficiency blue and sky-blue PeLEDs.<|>The industrialization of PeLEDs may be imminent. Although the operational stability of PeLEDs must still be further improved, we believe that the instability will be overcome eventually because the major degradation mechanisms are known. Furthermore, MHP NP emitters themselves might be commercialized much earlier than PeLEDs because the MHP NPs can be used in photoluminescent color filters with their remarkably high color purity for down conversion of an excitation light source. From this work here, researchers should gain insight into recent studies, and eventually contribute to the development of high-stability PeLEDs.<|>Acknowledgements<|>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (NRF-2016R1A3B1908431).<|>Conflict of Interest<|>The authors declare no conflict of interest.<|>Keywords<|>device lifetime, ion diffusion, long-term stability, next-generation emitters, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites<|>Received: August 13, 2017 Revised: October 14, 2017 Published online:<|>[1] H.
