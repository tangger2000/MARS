The improved crystallinity, passivated defects, and increased hydrophobic it y of the  DFPDA-treated perovskite are likely to be responsible for the  improved air stability.  \n\nFurthermore, the thermal and light st abilities of the hybrid  PSCs with and without DFPDA additive were also evaluated.  All the hybrid PSCs were annealed on a hot plate at   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  or  illuminated under one equivalent sun for different times. In  order to improve the thermal stability of the device, a small  quantity  of  poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)amine]  was added into Spiro-OMeTAD layer according to the literature.  As shown in Figure 7c,d. it is obvious that the hybrid  PSCs with DFPDA additive exhibit more stable performance  than the control devices.

These air, thermal, and light stability  testing results indicate that the hybrid PSCs with DFPDA  additive have better long term stability than the control device.  This can be attributed to the pass iv ation effect and hydrophobicity of DFPDA, which could effectively reduce the defect  density and water/oxygen adsorption, and stabilize the perovskite lattice.  \n\n# 3.

NMR was performed by using a JNM-ECZ400S/L1 with a frequency  of   $400~\\mathsf{M}\\mathsf{H}z$  , and deuterated DMSO was used as the solvent to dissolve  DFPDA and   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   with DFPDA. Contact angle measurements were  performed on an OCA20 instrument (Data-physics). Mass spectra  were obtained on a MAXIS LC-MS spectrometer. The AFM images were  acquired using a Veeco NanoScope IV with a silicon cantilever. XPS  analysis was performed using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB  250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The band structures of the perovskite  films were analyzed using UPS (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher).  Absorption spectra of perovskite films were characterized on a UV–vis  NIR spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics Instrument). PL (excitation at   $532\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathrm{m})$  ) spectra were investigated using an Edinburgh Instruments  Ltd. FLS980 spectrometer under   $510\\;\\mathrm{\\textmu\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
