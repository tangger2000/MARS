Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In particular, the BVO-1.5h film  exhibits an optimized photo current density of   $5.38\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$    at   $1.23~\\mathrm{V}$   versus RHE under back illumination. To make better  use of the light, another identical BVO-1.5h film was located  behind the BVO-1.5h film to form dual   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photo anodes  (denoted as 2-BVO-1.5h), as shown in Figure S5 (Supporting  Information). As expected, the photo current density can  be further increased to   $6.22\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}^{-2}}$   at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE  ( Figure   2 a), corresponding to a high   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}}\\times\\eta_{\\mathrm{sep}}$   value of   $83\\%$  .  To confirm the superior PEC performance of the BVO-1.5h  film newly developed in our lab, another pure   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   film with  similar film thickness and crystal structure (Figure S6, Supporting Information) was fabricated by spin-coating (denoted  as BVO-S) according to a previous report.  Surprisingly, even  though the BVO-S film exhibits a porous structure that is beneficial for charge separation (Figure S6a, Supporting Information),  the photo current density at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE is   $3.02~\\mathrm{\\mA}~\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$   (Figure 2a), which is only   $56.1\\%$   of the  BVO-1.5h film.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/e54f0407439c5a2869668b479822fe32da50a26b0afcfc88a396de60fb2b6183-1727117544.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   a) Digital images and b) XRD patterns of BVO-0.5h, BVO-1h, BVO-1.5h, and BVO-2h.

Insets: the corresponding cross-sectional views.  \n\nTo better understand the PEC performance of the BVO-1.5h,  2-BVO-1.5h, and BVO-S films, their incident photon-to-current  conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were measured at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$  versus RHE using a borate buffer in the presence of   $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{3}$  as a hole scavenger under back illumination. As shown in  Figure 2b, the photo current responses of all films are located  in the wavelength region of   $300{-}520~\\mathrm{nm}$  , which conforms well  to the   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   film with a bandgap of around   $2.4~\\mathrm{eV}.^{[2a,3a,17]}$   The  BVO-1.5h film exhibits an IPCE of around  $90\\%$   at a wavelength  up to   $450\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , whereas the IPCE values for the BVO-S film  are lower than   $50\\%$   in the whole range of   $300{-}520\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . Considering the very similar light absorption spectra of the BVO-\n $1.5\\mathrm{h}$   and BVO-S films in the absorption range of   $300{-}520\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  (Figure 2c), the effect of light absorption on the photo current  density is negligible.  It is noticed that the absorption baseline of the 2-BVO-1.5h films is higher than the BVO-1.5h and  BVO-S films, which is mainly attributed to the presence of two  pieces of FTO glass substrates in the dual photoanode system.  \n\nInterestingly, the BVO-1.5h film exhibits a tail absorption  band in the range of   $700{-}850\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   compared to the BVO-S film  (Figure 2c), indicating the formation of oxygen vacancies in the  BVO-1.5h film.  To confirm the formation of oxygen vacancies, XPS was carried out to investigate the surface chemical  states of the BVO-1.5h and BVO-S films, as shown in Figure 2d.  According to the area of the peaks, the atomic ratios of   $\\mathrm{O_{L}},$   $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}},$   and   $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{C}}$   can be calculated.  As shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information), the atomic ratio of oxygen vacancies   $(\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}})$   in the BVO-1.5h film is almost triple that of the BVO-S  film. In addition, a slight shift of around   $0.2~\\mathrm{eV}$   in both Bi 4f  and   $\\textsl{V2p}$   spectra of the BVO-1.5h is also observed compared  to the BVO-S film (Figure S7, Supporting Information), which  is attributable to the different chemical environment caused by  the oxygen vacancies.  The presence of oxygen vacancies was  further confirmed by photo luminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The  much stronger PL emission peak for the BVO-1.5h film clearly  illustrates that the BVO-1.5 film should contain much more  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/92eed23ae1dd58ff98c1a1747740ddb8d8ee718a6a175a0722495ad7a23648b1-1727117558.jpg)  \nFigure 2.  $1.23\\;\\lor$  1.5h, and BVO-S films. d) XPS spectra of O 1s for the BVO-1.5h and BVO-S films.

Both films exhibit a similar flat band potential (intercept on   $_x$  -axis) of   ${\\approx}0.28~\\mathrm{V}$   versus RHE (Figure S9a, Supporting Information), which is close to the onset potentials shown in Figure 2a.  In addition, a shallower slope for the BVO-1.5h film is observed  compared to the BVO-S film, indicating a higher donor density in  the BVO-1.5h film. Carrier densities of the BVO-1.5h and BVO-S  films can be calculated from the corresponding slopes using  Equation (S7) (Supporting Information). As shown in Table S2 \n\n (Supporting Information), the charge carrier density of the BVO-\n1.5h film almost doubles that of the BVO-S film, indicating the  better electronic conductivity that leads to better electron–hole  separation within the BVO-1.5h film. The EIS curves are composed of a semicircle, which can be fitted according to the equivalent circuit model (inset in Figure S9b, Supporting Information).  The   $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$   and  $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$   represent the series resistance and charge transfer  resistance, respectively. As shown in Table S3 (Supporting Information), both films exhibit similar   $R_{s}{\\mathrm{.}}$  , suggesting that the effect  of the series resistance is negligible. While much smaller   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$  in the BVO-1.5h film indicates the better charge transfer property,\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
