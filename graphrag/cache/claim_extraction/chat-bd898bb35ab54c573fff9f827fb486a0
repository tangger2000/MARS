Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

With increasing temperature from 83 to 323 K, the integrated PL intensity decreased  and the FWHM of PL peak broadened, being consistent with  a model that more phonons coupled to excitons which exacerbate non radiative recombination at higher temperatures.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/f2d32b97bbbcf8df0269c5a9b619e849c1eee51785ca2ca37f143d10e19781d1-1723824434.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{\\mathrm{:}}2.75\\%\\mathsf{B i}.$  . c) PL decay curve of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{:}2.75\\%\\mathsf{B i}$   bulk crystals   $(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{ex}}=365~\\mathsf{n m}$   $\\lambda_{\\mathsf{e m}}=455~\\mathsf{n m})$  ). The red curve is a fit to the experimental data with a single exponential decay function. d) Pseudo color map of the temperaturedependent PL spectra of  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{:}2.75\\%\\mathsf{B i}$   crystal.  \n\nBy fitting the temperature dependent integrated PL intensity  (Figure S5b, Supporting Information), an Arrhenius behavior  with two activated energy of 30 and   $230\\,\\mathrm{\\meV}$   was observed  (fitting with one activation energy failed). This suggests activation of two defects, one donor and one acceptor,  and we  tentatively ascribe them to   $\\mathrm{V_{Cl}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$  , which is the thermodynamically preferred defect complex, as will be revealed by theoretical simulation later. Optical transition between this defect  complex is thus hypothesized to be responsible for the observed  PL, however, the luminescent mechanism still calls for further  careful study. In addition, a fitting of the FWHM has been  applied by a phonon broadening model.  For the fitting, electron–phonon coupling parameter  S  and   $\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{phonon}}$   are calculated  as 31.1 and   $22.3\\ \\mathrm{meV}$   (Figure S5c, Supporting Information),  which suggested strong electron–phonon coupling in the soft  halide matrix.  \n\nAbove characterization and analysis suggested that the PL  is likely to be originated from donor–acceptor pair emission  instead of direct emission from   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$  . Therefore, we performed  density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the  electronic states of the Bi incorporated in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   and their  effects on the op to electronic and photo physical properties. The  Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional was used,  since it provides a reasonable bandgap of   $3.93\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   close to the  experimental value of   $3.90\\;\\mathrm{eV}.$  \n\nIt is known that the dopability in semiconductor depends significantly on the chemical condition of the synthesis process. In  this context, we first determined the chemical potential window  (the yellow region) where the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   phase is stabilized, as  shown in  Figure   5 a. It is seen that   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   exhibits a quite  large chemical potential region, as compared to those reported  for typical   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   halide per ovsk ites, indicating the easy formation of pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   phase. From the chemical window, the  lowest decomposition enthalpy   $(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{d}})$   is calculated to be   $1.37~\\mathrm{eV}$  per formula unit (f.u.) along the decomposition pathway   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}\\rightarrow2\\mathrm{CsCl}+\\mathrm{SnCl}_{4}$  . This value is one or two orders  of magnitude larger than those for the typical   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   halide  per ovsk ites (e.g.,   $-0.09$  , 0.15, 0.29, and   $0.47\\,\\mathrm{~eV}$  per f.u. for   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$  ,    $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}.$  ,  and   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{n}}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{3}$  , respectively)  and recently reported halide double per ovsk ites (e.g., 0.05, 0.16,  and   $0.06\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   per f.u. for   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i C l_{6}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}.$  respectively),  which explains the above-observed superior  thermal stability for   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   (see Figures S2 and S4 in the  Supporting Information).  \n\nThen, we studied the solubility and the electronic states  of the Bi incorporated in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   by supercell defect calculations. We first considered two most probable states, i.e., Bi  interstitial (Bi i ) (at the   $\\sqsupset$   site in   $\\mathrm{A}_{2}\\mathrm{Sn}\\boxed{\\mathrm{X}_{6}}$  , where   $\\sqsupset$   denotes  a vacancy site in this vacancy-ordered double perovskite structure) and Bi-on-Sn substitution   $\\left(\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}\\right)$  . The calculated formation enthalpies   $(\\Delta H)$   for neutral   $\\mathrm{Bi_{i}}$  and   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   are shown  in Figure 5b (olive and blue lines, respectively). Obviously,   $\\mathrm{Bi_{i}}$   has too high   $\\Delta H$   values in the whole chemical potential  regions, and thus can hardly form.   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   also can hardly form  under the   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}{-}r i c h/S n^{2+}}$  -poor conditions (i.e., in the high   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$  regions   $_{\\mathrm{C-F}}$   in the yellow region in Figure 5a) due to the too  high   $\\Delta H$   values; but it can form under   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}{-}p o o r/S n^{2+}}$  -rich  conditions (in the low  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   regions A, B, and G), where the  $\\Delta H$  values are low and even negative. This result indicates that a   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  -poor/  ${'}\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$  -rich condition, i.e., a   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$  -based reagent, is  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/f7ca8852a33abb1fb6adf4d1e99c222fff6e5448ab31ae1148d1a96e835d4ec7-1723824435.jpg)  \nFigure 5.   a) Calculated chemical potential window where   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}$   is stabilized against possible competing phases including Cs, Sn,   ${\\sf C I}_{2}$  , CsCl,   $\\mathsf{S n C l}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathsf{S n C l}_{4}$  ,  $\\mathsf{C s S n\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
