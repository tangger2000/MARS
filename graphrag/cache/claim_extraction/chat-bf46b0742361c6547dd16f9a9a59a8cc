Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

As shown in the external  quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Figure 3d), the integrated   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   from the 3D and 2D-3D PSCs reached 21.21 and   $21.42\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, which confirms the validity and  calibration of our AM1.5 light source .  \n\nThe PCE enhancement mainly comes from the improved   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and we hypothesize that the higher   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   results from  larger Fermi-level splitting and suppressed non radiative  recombination by the 2D perovskite capping layer. To reveal the  mechanism for the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement in the fabricated 2D-3D  PSCs, the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) technique  was employed to detect the surface potential difference of perovskite films, which is associated with the work function with  respect to the vacuum energy level. As shown in  Figure   4 a,c,  the atomic force microscope (AFM) image of the as-prepared  2D-3D perovskite film indicates a smoother surface morphology  with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of  $17.8\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , which is  lower than that of the pristine 3D perovskite film (  ${\\mathrm{RMS}}=20.8$  nm). The work functions of the perovskite films are determined  by the contact potential difference (CPD) between a   $\\mathrm{Pt}$  -coated  conductive cantilever probe and the samples. In the statistic  CPD of KPFM results, the 2D-3D perovskite film shows a lower  average CPD   $(-108\\mathrm{~}\\mathrm{mV})$   than that   $(-41\\ \\mathrm{mV})$   of 3D perovskite  film, indicating a downward shift of Fermi level after PEAI  post-treatment (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Moreover,  the KPFM image of the 3D perovskite film exhibits notable  dark grains related with heterogeneous surface potential distribution (Figure 4b), which is consistent with a larger variation in  the measured CPD of the 3D perovskite film (Figure S7, Supporting Information). In sharp contrast, the KPFM result of the  2D-3D perovskite film presents uniformly distributed surface  potentials (Figure 4d), which may be due to the partial elimination of subgap defect states and thus suppressed non radiative  recombination.  Benefiting from the deeper Fermi level in  the dark condition, the 2D-3D perovskite films tend to exhibit  a larger gap between the splitting of electron quasi-Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{fin}}\\right)$   and hole quasi-Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{fp}}\\right)$   under light illumination, as illustrated in Figure 4e,f.  The downward-shifted   $E_{\\mathrm{fp}}$    of 2D-3D perovskite matches better with the HOMO level of  HTM under illumination, leading to optimized energy band  alignment and reduced non radiative recombination loss.   The   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement extracted from the   $J{-}V$  measurements  is nearly equal to the downward shift of Fermi level calculated  from KPFM results, which verifies our hypothesis on the origin  of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement.  \n\nTo further confirm the suppressed non radiative recombination in the 2D-3D perovskite films, we carried out the time- resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements. The samples used  for studying the charge recombination dynamics were prepared by depositing various perovskite films on glass substrates  (Figure   $^{4\\mathrm{g})}$  . Two time components can be obtained to evaluate  the carrier recombination lifetime of the as-prepared perovskite  films by fitting the TRPL curves with a bi-exponential function  of time ( t )  \n\n$$\nF\\left(t\\right)\\!=A_{1}e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}}+A_{2}e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{2}}}+\\gamma_{0}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\tau_{1}$   and   $\\tau_{2}$   represent the time constant of the fast and slow  decay process, respectively.  The fast decay   $(\\tau_{1})$   component  is attributed to the surface recombination, while the slow decay   $(\\tau_{2})$   component is associated with the recombination occurring  in the bulk of the perovskite structures.

The average recombination lifetime   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}})$   was estimated from the fitted curve data  according to the following equation  \n\n$$\n{\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}}}=\\left(A_{1}\\tau_{1}^{2}+A_{2}\\tau_{2}^{2}\\right)/\\left(A_{1}\\tau_{1}+A_{2}\\tau_{2}\\right)\n$$  \n\nAfter calculation, the average lifetime of the pristine 3D  perovskite sample (795.0 ns) was prolonged to 868.0 ns in the  2D-3D perovskite sample, indicating the reduced non radiative  recombination via the PEAI post-treatment. We also investigated the charge carrier dynamics of the pristine 2D perovskite  film deposited on glass substrates and its thickness was determined to be  ${\\approx}500\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   by a pro filo meter.
