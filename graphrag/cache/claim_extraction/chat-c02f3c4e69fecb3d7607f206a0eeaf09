{"result": "## Planar-Structure Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency beyond 21%\n\nQi Jiang, Zema Chu, Pengyang Wang, Xiaolei Yang, Heng Liu, Ye Wang, Zhigang Yin, Jinliang Wu, Xingwang Zhang, and Jingbi You\n\nof planar structure has been pushed to beyond $20\\%$. Although tremendous improvement was achieved in planar-structure perovskite solar cells, the certificated efficiency $(20.1\\%)$ is still lag behind the art of mesoporous of $22.1\\%$.\n\nLow temperature solution processed planar-structure perovskite solar cells gain great attention recently, while their power conversions are still lower than that of high temperature mesoporous counterpart. Previous reports are mainly focused on perovskite morphology control and interface engineering to improve performance. Here, this study systematically investigates the effect of precise stoichiometry, especially the $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ contents on device performance including efficiency, hysteresis and stability. This study finds that a moderate residual of $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ can deliver stable and high efficiency of solar cells without hysteresis, while too much residual $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ will lead to serious hysteresis and poor transit stability. Solar cells with the efficiencies of $21.6\\%$ in small size $(0.0737\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$ and $20.1\\%$ in large size $(1\\ {\\mathrm{cm}}^{2})$ with moderate residual $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ in perovskite layer are obtained. The certificated efficiency for small size shows the efficiency of $20.9\\%$, which is the highest efficiency ever recorded in planar-structure perovskite solar cells, showing the planar-structure perovskite solar cells are very promising.\n\nIt is very necessary to further push the efficiency of planar-structure perovskite solar cells. Previous researches were more focusing on the morphology control and interface engineering to improve device performance. In fact, for a given perovskite, precise stoichiometry is also a critical issue in affecting device performance. Son et al. found that a small amount of excess organic salt such as $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{I}$ could be beneficial for device performance, while most believed that a small amount of $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ could passivate the defects and also deliver the high efficiency. Although it was suggested that excess $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ was positive for device performance, there are few study on the effect of excess $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ on devices hysteresis and stability, which are another two equally important issues compared with efficiency in perovskite solar cells.\n\nHere, we adopted two-step spin-coating method to finely control residual $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ contents in perovskite layer, and configure $n{-}i{-}p$ planar structure solar cells. We found that a moderate residual of $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ could deliver stable and high efficiency of solar cells, over excess of $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ in the perovskite layer will lead to the devices with serious hysteresis and also poor transit stability. According to finely tuned residual $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ in perovskite layer, a $21.6\\%$ power conversion efficiency (PCE) in size of $0.0737\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ and a $20.1\\%$ PCE in size of $1\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ devices were obtained in the laboratory, and a $20.9\\%$ certificated efficiency was shown in small size $(0.0737\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$.\n\nWe used the $(\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3})_{1-x}(\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3})_{x}$ as the model system, which has been confirmed as an efficient absorber. Twostep spin-coating method was adopted to deposit perovskite layer, i.e. first, a $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ layer was coated on the $\\mathrm{ITO/SnO}_{2}$ substrate, second, organic salts form amid in ium iodide (FAI) mixed with methyl ammonium bromide (MABr) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) (simply, FAI will represent almost all the mixture organic component we used) were coated on $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ layer, and finally the perovskite phase was formed by diffusion via annealing the $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}/\\mathrm{FAI}$ quasi-bilayer. The first layer of $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ is critical for the subsequent formation of perovskite layer. Previously, N, N-dimethyl form amide (DMF) was used as the solvent for dissolving $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$, which usually lead to rough $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ surface due to the strong crystallinity (Figure S1, Supporting Information). This could lead to rough surface of the resulting perovskite layer and also the poor contact between perovskite layer and hole transport layer. Solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) owns high boiling point and also it could easily combine with $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ to form $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}-\\mathrm{DMSO}$ complex, these will slow down the crystallization of $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ while drying the $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ precursor film. We added $5\\%$ volume of DMSO solvent in DMF as a mixture solvent for dissolving $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ layer, as we expected, the formation of $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ layer from mixture solvent becomes dense and smooth (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which could be helpful for forming smooth perovskite layer and also for better device performance.\n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/20b44b5d60502a5e51f22dbb14a83280b46081883d5c17895d874c16ab4d8f21-1723832620.jpg)  \nFigure 1. $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$.
