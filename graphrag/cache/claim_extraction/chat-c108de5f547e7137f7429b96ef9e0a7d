Moreover, mechanical designs to  the substrate such as pre stretching and origami have been  widely adopted to increase the deform ability as well as the light  absorption of the device.  \n\nPolymer, paper, and fiber are the three most commonly  adopted substrate materials. Polymer and paper share some  similarities on fundamental design principles for both of them  show a certain degree of flexibility and are suitable for largescale fabrication. However, there is a better adhesion between  paper and materials thanks to the porous structure of paper.  Moreover, the higher bend ability of paper makes spatial designs  such as origami possible, which turns 2D structures into 3D  configurations. Fiber substrate based PDs, apart from being  breathable, can also absorb light from   $360^{\\circ}$   and can be woven  with textiles for further applications.  \n\nDesigns to improve op to electronic performances of the  wearable PDs are also studied. Resonant optical cavity device  architecture,  plasmonic enhancement,  charge carrier  transfer engineering,  single-mode waveguides,  etc. have  been explored and employed for desirable device properties  such as more efficient electron–hole separation and a higher  resp on siv it y.  \n\nDue to the limitation of space, here we mainly focus on the  materials selections, especially substrates, of wearable PDs,  while performances of devices are also of vital significance.  Table  1 shows the materials selection, mechanical properties,  and op to electronic properties of some typical wearable PDs for  consultation.  \n\n# 3. Applications of Wearable Photodetector Systems  \n\nThe typical applications of photodetector systems can be  divided into three types: monitoring, imaging, and optical  communications. Wearable photodetector systems inherit the  basic functions of these applications but set additional challenges due to the required flexibility. Monitoring system generally requires a precise output of the intensity or intensity  variation of the incident light, which contains the target information. Thus, the requirements of photo resp on siv it y and detectivity are high for the photodetector s in monitoring systems  to guarantee a sufficient sensitivity. The flexibility of wearable  PDs actually limits the device structures and decreases the  op to electronic performances to some extent. Therefore, more  attention should be paid to the device fabrication for wearable monitoring. Although some monitoring applications like  UV monitors and light power meters are based on the direct  response to external light sources, plenty of other applications  like smoke detectors, biosensors, and locators rely on the integration with other electronic devices, such as light sources  (light emitting diode (LED) etc.), where the target information hides in the scattering and absorption data. However, the  integration of LEDs with PDs on flexible structures may bring  new problems in these occasions. Photo image rs are based on  photodetector arrays, where each photodetector serves as an  individual pixel. Traditional commercial imagers are based on  silicon technology, where the substrates are “hard.” While for  flexible substrates, high-pixel integration, and the relevant electric circuits are difficult to achieve. Thus, this is a significant  challenge that high-performance wearable imagers would need  to solve in the future. Optical communication systems have a  strict limitation on wavelength, thus two things should be taken  into consideration in designing wearable systems. 1. Avoiding  the interference from environmental light. 2. Diminishing the  signal attenuation during signal transmission. To meet these  requirements, color buffers and complicated three-electrode  device architectures, which are rather difficult to realize on  flexible structures, are needed. Apart from the aforementioned  contents, the complex signal treatments also rely on additional  electric components to provide logic and memory function,  setting up additional obstacles to the wearable applications.  Fortunately, great progress has been made on the related territory, and we will give a detailed description about the wearable  applications of photodetector systems in the following part, discussing the progress and pointing out the unsolved problems.  \n\n# 3.1. Wearable Monitoring Systems  \n\nPhotodetector s are particularly promising candidates for health  monitors due to their essential function of light detection.  To gain a better understanding of the realization of wearable  monitors based on photo detection, here we sort these wearables into two categories according to different applications: (1)  monitoring internal signals involving heart rates, pulses, blood  oxygen levels, etc.; (2) monitoring ambient light, for instance,  UV intensity.  \n\nSeveral reports introducing photodetector s into health monitoring have attracted increasing attention. As can be seen from  Figure    6 b, the near-field communication (NFC) technology,  which powers up the photodetector and LEDs as well as other  electronics, is used to fabricate a miniaturized, wireless and  battery-free device for monitoring signals of photo ple thysmograms and reflectance pulse oximetry.  The commercial  photo­ detector collects the back scattering or transmitting light  (red and infrared) signals, which are related to the blood oxygenation, heart rate, and heart rate variability. The ultrasmall  system can be mounted on soft skin or hard surfaces, presenting the possibilities of achieving highly integrated wearables. Other interesting findings related to photo ple thys mograms sensors utilized photo transistors with lower power consumption.  The integration of LEDs and PDs continues to  be a great strategy for health monitoring. One groundbreaking  work successfully achieved an ultrathin flexible system (optoelectronic skins) with a total thickness of just   $3~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   using red  polymer LEDs and organic photodetector s (Figure 6a).  The  device could not only work as a pulse oximeter but also display  visualized results. It is noteworthy that the stretch able nature  results from the encapsulation layer consisting of SiON and  parylene. In addition to organics PDs, inorganic PDs owning  reliable electrical and mechanical properties are also used for  attachable and flexible pulse and heart rates measuring.  \n\nExcess UV exposure is one of the most common causes of  skin cancers. Recently, a real-time wearable UV monitor system  based on a fiber-shaped p–n junction was reported, as shown in  Figure 6c.  Particular emphasis is placed on its ultrahigh photo­ current, which originates from the well-chosen materials and  elaborately designed device layout. The conformal coating of  p-typed transparent   $\\mathrm{{CuZnS}}$   film perfectly maintains the structure of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   nanotube arrays, and the p–n junction effectively  introduces the self-powered property and suppresses the combination of photo-induced carriers. The high current reaches  the electrical requirements of integrating with other commercial electronics to realize a monitoring system with a smartphone through Wi-Fi. Much work so far has focused on other  wide band gap semiconductors such as   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   for high photocurrents and spectral selectivity other than   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  .  Optimized  hierarchical structure of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   photodetector s is proposed to  obtain ultrahigh milli ampere photo currents and very low dark  currents, featuring a high sensitivity and an excellent selectivity  to very low ultraviolet light intensities.  The specific focus of  the device is its ultra porous nano particle networks with the particle size below twice the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   Debye length. Apart from UV  photo electrical detectors, other wearable sensors have proved  promising and very useful. Here are two examples: Zou et al.  applied an ink composed of multiredox active photo electrochromic molecules for spectrally selective UV monitoring, and  developed a paper-based bracelet meeting the needs of people  with different skin phototypes.  Qiu et  al. utilized a photoelectrochemical cell on the basis of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   nanotubes and Prussian blue. The device can change from dark blue to transparent  when exposed to UV light.  \n\nPhotosensitive materials also go beyond light detection for  other wearable applications, such as UV-assisted gas sensors   and bio molecule detection.  For wearable sensors, synthesis  process and responsive properties must accommodate demands  of superior sensitivity, flexibility, and stability for integration.  \n\nParticular attention should be paid to the two critical charact eris tics of wearable monitors: (1) self-powered property, as  the current power sources are not miniature enough to meet  the requirements of functional wearable electronic systems;  (2) flexibility and robustness, which allow devices to maintain  stable output signals under dynamic motions.  Constructing  p–n junctions or MSM structures are common ways to endow a  PD with self-powered features. Strategies to make a PD device  wearable include careful selection of substrates and elaborate  design of the device layout, which can be referred to the discussion in Section 2.  \n\nThe research about wearable monitoring based on photo­ detectors has continued to grow in numbers, indicating that  there is an urgent need, but it is still a significant challenge to  realize the integration of real-time wearable data acquisition,  processing, and outputting. In addition, to transform rigid device  into a flexible and portable one is the essence of\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
