Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It is understandable that  the white-light emission originates from the synergetic work of  blue and yellow emission components in the composites. Both  of them are relatively independent and can be flexibly tuned  to achieve an optimal intensity ratio, producing a high-quality  white light emission.  \n\nTo evaluate the suitability of as-synthesized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@$   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites for practical WLEDs applications, we  investigated the effects of heat, UV light, and environmental  oxygen/moisture on the structural and optical properties of   $\\mathrm{CsCu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites. First, the successive heating/ cooling cycling PL measurements were conducted in the temperature range of   ${20}{-100}~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , and the integrated PL intensity at each temperature point was plotted in  Figure    4 a. One  can see that the relative PL intensity gradually weakens with  increasing temperature because of the temperature-induced  fluorescence quenching.  Excitingly, the emission degradation at high temperature is almost recoverable after the cooling  process was administered, with the spectral shape and line  width unchanged, and more details can be found from two  sets of PL spectra recorded in cycle 1 (Figure S11, Supporting  Information). Even after successive ten heating/cooling cycles,  the original PL performance remains nearly constant, as summarized in Figure 4b, greatly superior to the previous studies  on conventional lead-based halides.  The above results indicate a remarkable thermal tolerance of the   $\\mathrm{CsCu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$    composites. Further, the photo stability test of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@$   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites was implemented by continuously illuminating the sample with a portable UV lamp, and the emission performance was quantitatively studied by recording the  evolution of PL with time. As shown in Figure  4c, an undesired but very tiny fluorescence decay of   ${\\approx}2\\%$   occurs after   $62\\textup{h}$   continuous UV light irradiation, which may be due to the  photo-oxidation effect, as observed in conventional lead-based  halides.  The photo-oxidation degradation process generally  includes the following main steps: generation of superoxide  species on the surface under UV light irradiation, fast oxidation of the surface and production of water, slow hydration of  the inner lead-based halides, and final destruction of the materials lattices.  Besides, the storage stability of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@$   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites was inspected by monitoring intermittently their emission performance in air ambient   $(20{-}25\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C};$  ;   $50{-}60\\%$   humidity). As shown in Figure 4d, almost no fluorescence degradation appears after 50-day storage, and the initial  emission performance can be well retained. Also, the structural  characteristics of   $\\mathrm{CsCu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites do not deteriorate in ambient conditions, preserving their structural integrity  without the appearance of additional diffraction s (Figure S12,  Supporting Information).

Experimentally, for the first time, we fabricated the  electrically-driven WLEDs with a multilayer architecture of  ITO/PEDO  $\\mathrm{T}{:}\\mathrm{PSS/poly}{\\mathrm{-}}\\mathrm{TPD/PVK/CsCu_{2}I_{3}@C s_{3}C u_{2}I_{5}/T P B i/}$  LiF/Al (details are shown in the Experimental Section), and the  schematic diagram of device is displayed in  Figure   5 a. A typical  photograph of the resulting device with four emitting units is  displayed in Figure 5b, and each unit has an area of   $4\\;\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   as  de terminated by the overlapping area of patterned ITO and Al  electrode. In this device structure, bilayer-structured hole transport layer (HTL, poly-TPD/PVK) take advantage of the relatively  high hole mobility of poly-TPD and the deep valence-band  energy level of PVK to achieve an efficient hole injection into the  emission layer.  The TPBi interlayer could be regarded as the  electron transport layer (ETL) because of their relatively small  electron affinity and low energy level of the valence band.  In  our experiments, three devices with the CsI/CuI molar ratios of  1.05:2, 1.15:2, and 1.25:2 were fabricated. To evaluate the device  performance, three WLEDs were electrically driven in the DC  mode, and the light emission was collected from the back side  of the ITO/glass substrate.\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
