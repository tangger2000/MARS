The content focuses on the interaction between PBGH and SnO2, as well as the effects of PBGH on the perovskite layer, as observed through XPS measurements and other characterization techniques.<|>Additionally, the Cl 2p and N 1s XPS spectra for the PBGH and SnO2/PBGH films are shown in Figure 3c,d. The Cl 2p signal is deconvoluted into two peaks, that is, Cl 2p5/2 for the lower binding energy and Cl 2p3/2 for the other one. The Cl 2p peaks for the pure PBGH film lie at 199.47 and 197.90 eV, respectively, which dramatically shift to 200.53 and 198.60 eV for the SnO2/PBGH bilayer film, indicating significant change in electron cloud density of Cl-. This is ascribed to the electrostatic coupling between Cl- and Sn4+, thus leading to the passivation of O vacancies. According to the literature, the reduction of O vacancies results in the improvement of conductivity, which is in line with the conclusion in Figure 2a. Meanwhile, the N 1s signals for PBGH and SnO2/PBGH films are deconvoluted into three peaks. For the pure PBGH film, the three peaks appearing at 400.39, 399.87, and 399.08 eV are assigned to ammonium (NH3+), C-N, and C=N, respectively. And the peaks representing C-N and C=N shift to lower binding energies of 399.70 and 398.60 eV for the SnO2/PBGH film, due to the Lewis acid/base coordination between C=N (with lone pair electrons) and the under coordinated Sn4+. The passivation of Sn dangling bonds not only makes it difficult for SnO2 film to absorb O2 and H2O in the atmosphere, but also play an important role in inhibiting the capture of electrons as well. Hence, the improved conductivity and promoted charge transfer property of the SnO2/PBGH film are originated from the passivated O vacancies and Sn dangling bonds. More XPS measurements were performed to further explore the effects of PBGH on the perovskite layer. As presented in Figure 3e,f, high-resolution XPS spectra of Pb 4f and I 3d were detected. For the pure PbI2 film, two main peaks of Pb 4f spectra are located at 143.27 and 138.41 eV, corresponding to Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2, respectively. The Pb 4f peaks for the PbI2+PBGH mixed film shift to higher binding energies of 143.57 and 138.69 eV, respectively. I 3d signals appear at 630.48 and 619.00 eV for the pure PbI2 film and exhibit blueshift by 0.36 eV for the PbI2+PBGH mixed film. The shifting in Pb 4f and I 3d spectra demonstrate the interaction between PBGH and PbI2. And then, the N 1s and O 1s signals of the pure PBGH and PbI2+PBGH mixed films are observed to elucidate it. The O 1s spectra are deconvoluted into two peaks (Figure 3g), which are related to C=O and C-OH, respectively. And the peak of C=O for the PbI2+PBGH mixture exhibits blueshift compared to that of the pure PBGH film, resulting from the coordination of C=O and Pb2+. Moreover, it was reported in the previous work that phenyl can strengthen the interaction between C=O and Pb2+ via the delocalization of π electron from C=O. The coordination of C=O and PbI2 in the perovskite precursor film will retard the growth of perovskite crystals, and thus compact perovskite films with large grains can be obtained, which is in accordance with the variation in the SEM images (Figure 1d). In the N 1s spectra (Figure 3h), the peak representing NH3+ shifts from 400.39 eV (for the PBGH film) to 400.61 eV (for the PbI2+ PBGH mixture), which is ascribed to the formation of hydrogen bond between NH3+ and I-. The hydrogen bond of N-H···I contributes to the passivation of iodine related defects and the suppressed ion migration.)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1.
