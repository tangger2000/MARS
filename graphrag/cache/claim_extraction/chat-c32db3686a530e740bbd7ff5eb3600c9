Currently, PSC efficiency exceeds   $23.0\\%$   in the PCE,  the  commercialization of these devices is  becoming increasingly possible. In addition, HMHP materials and their related  applications are rapidly evolving and  spreading to many different research  fields,  for example, electro luminescence,  thermo electrics,  spintronics,  and electronic parts.   Therefore, PSC efficiency is no longer the  primary challenge, whereas improving  the stability of HMHPs under light, heat,  and moisture is vital. Hence, the stability  of HMHP materials in solar cell devices  must be improved.  \n\nHybrid lead halide perovskite materials are used in solar cells and show efficiencies greater than   $\\mathbf{\\lambda_{23\\%}}$  . Furthermore, they are applied in light-emitting  diodes, X-ray detectors, thin-film transistors, thermo electrics, and memory  devices. Lead trihalide hybrid materials contain methyl ammonium (MA)  or form amid in i um (FA) (or a mixture), or long alkyl ammonium halides, as  alternative organic cations. However, the intrinsic stability of hybrid lead  halide per ovsk ites is not very high, and they are chemically unstable when  exposed to moisture, light, or heat because of their organic contents and  low formation energies. Therefore, although improvements in the chemical  stability are crucial, changing the material composition is challenging  because it is directly related to the desired application requirements. Fortunately, hybrid lead halide per ovsk ites have a very high tolerance toward  changes in physical properties arising from doping or addition of different  cations and anions, in many cases showing improved properties. Here, the  intrinsic instability of hybrid lead halide per ovsk ites is reviewed in relation  to the crystal phase and chemical stability. It is suggested that FA should  be used for lead halide per ovsk ites for chemical stability instead of MA.  Furthermore, additives that stabilize the crystal phase with   $\\pmb{\\alpha}{\\mathsf{a}}{\\mathsf{F A P b}}{\\mathsf{I}}_{3}$   should  eschew MA.  \n\nFurthermore, there is an additional  instability issue due to the mobility of  the ions in the HMHP framework.   The mobile ions are readily decomposed  by the entry of self-ionizing water mole­ cules, under atmospheric conditions.  \n\nTo increase the stability of HMHP materials, the use of highly  hydrophobic encapsulation materials between gold counter  electrodes and the HMHP layers has been reported.  In  addition, the thermal stability of HMHP materials and solar  cell devices are frequently the subject of discussion, because of  another factor that affects their long-term stability: the crystal  phase transition with ion migration in HMHPs.  Other factors, such as the photo stability of HMHPs in solar cell applications, are also becoming essential topics, because of the  instability of these devices under AM1.5G (1 sun) irradiation,  including UV.  Under these conditions, the materials in solar  cell devices can be damaged by photoinduced charge excitation  and transport, however, for commercialization, the PCE of a  solar cell device must remain constant during extended use.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nIn 1978, Weber reported the crystalline properties of methylammonium lead halide, a hybrid metal halide perovskite  (HMHP).  In 1995, Mitzi et  al. reported Sn-based HMHPs  and their electrical properties, as well as proposed molecular  structures.  Subsequently, HMHPs have been used in solar  cells based on the same operating principle as that of conventional dye-sensitized solar cells, for example, the work of Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009.  Unfortunately, these devices not  only exhibit a low photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), but  also rapidly degraded in liquid electrolytes. We demonstrated  the first inorganic–organic hybrid he t ero junction solar cells  with HMHPs, which represented a new device architecture.  \n\nHence, it is currently necessary to consider the HMHP bulk  structure and its correlations, in terms of its physico chemical  properties. Herein, we review the intrinsic instability of HMHP  materials, from the crystal properties to ionization s of methylammonium cations, to realize highly stable HMHP materials  for real-world applications and commercialization. Moreover, we  discuss the crystal structures and their phase transitions with  respect to the fragmentation of the organic molecules in the  HMHP materials.  Finally, based on these understandings, we  propose new approaches (both technical and fundamental) to  address the intrinsic instability of HMHPs.  \n\n# 2. Origin of HMHP Instability  \n\nAs mentioned, improving the stability of HMHPs is currently  the most important challenge. It is a requirement for the development of stable materials and devices. Therefore, first the  crystallographic properties that are related to many electrical  and quantum mechanical properties need to be understood. In  the following sections, we discuss these factors, and their relationship with the inherent properties of HMHP materials.  \n\n# 2.1. Representative A-Site Cations and Their Various Phases   for Stable HMHP Materials  \n\nBefore discussing and reporting the stability of HMHP materials, the cause of instability in the HMHP structure need to  be determined. The halide perovskite structure is represented  by the general formula   ${\\mathrm{AMP}}_{3}$   (where A: Cs,    $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  ,    $\\mathrm{FA^{+}},^{[35,36]}$   or guan id in i um   $\\left(\\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{U}^{+}\\right)$  ;  M: Pb,    $\\mathrm{Sn}$  ,  Bi,  Sb,   or Ge;  and X: halide).  $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  , which are organic molecules that can be used as A-site cations, are shown in  Figure   1 a,  with the inorganic ions,   $C s^{+}$  . The organic cation of the A site  in an HMHP plays a very important role, compared with that  of the pure inorganic perovskite. A-site cations that can form  the HMHP are determined by the Goldschmidt tolerance   factor   $(t)^{[40]}$  \n\n$$\nt\\,{=}\\,\\left(r_{\\mathrm{A}}+r_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)/\\,2^{1/2}\\left(r_{\\mathrm{Pb}}+r_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere  $r_{\\mathrm{i}}$   and  $r_{\\mathrm{A}}$   are the ionic radii of the anion and A-site cation  values, respectively; for example, the ionic radii 2.03 and   $1.33\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$    for   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  ,  respectively, and a range of   $r_{\\mathrm{A}}~2.3{-}2.8$   Å.   When using   $C s^{+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  , or   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   as the A-site cations in HMHP  materials, the optical properties change with the cation identity, showing a red-shifting absorbance onset, in the order of   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}~}(1.55~\\mathrm{eV})<\\mathrm{Cs^{+}~}(1.5~\\mathrm{eV})<\\mathrm{FA^{+}~}(1.45~\\mathrm{eV}),$  , as the bandgap  shrinks.  At room temperature, the volume per   $\\mathrm{APbI}_{3}$    unit increases from 222 to 248 and   $256~\\mathring\\mathrm{A}^{3}$   for   $C s^{+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  cations, respectively, based on X-ray diffraction data.  Thus,   $C s^{+}$   and   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   differ significantly in size, but the difference between the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   cations is small.  Moreover,   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   crystallizes in the tetragonal   $I4/m c m^{[44]}$   (or   $I4/c m^{[44]})$    space group, under the same temperature conditions, whereas   $\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
