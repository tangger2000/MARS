Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Increased purification times resulted in  decreased vibration intensity for both samples, indicating the loss  of ligands during purification. A large decrease was observed for  the first two cycles, which can be attributed to the exclusion of  ODE. The decrease rate for OAm-QDs was much faster than  that for the DBSA-QDs, implying a stronger interaction between  DBSA and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs. The TG results were highly consistent  with the FTIR measurements that the decrease rate of organic  ligand content decrease was much faster for OAm-QDs than  that of DBSA-QDs (Figure 2d). The higher weight percentage for  DBSA-QDs is due to the larger molecular weight of DBSA. The  exact content of organic matter for DBSA-QDs is lower than that  of OAm-QDs (Figure S5, Supporting Information), suggesting  excellent purity of DBSA-QDs, which would enable potential  applications as high-performance LEDs.  \n\nSince the defect states can be efficiently passivated according  to the theoretical calculation and because the ligands bind to  QDs tightly, the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs are expected to show  high efficiency and good stability and be free from purification  problems.  Figure    3 a shows DBSA-QD colloidal solutions subjected to different washing cycles under daylight and UV light.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/6d6eabfd120cb9271629326ddad80f65a8d0f4b40477151ec1c1b9455ea1de10-1727124259.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   Evidence of strong DBSA-QD interaction. a)  $^1{\\sf H}$   NMR full spectra of pure DBSA and DBSA-QDs after three purification cycles. b) Diffusion  coefficients of DBSA and OAm capped QDs. c,d) Surface ligand content of OAm and DBSA capped QDs after different purification cycles according  to the FTIR (c) and TG (d) measurements.  \n\nThere was no obvious difference between these eight samples in  terms of efficiency, emission wavelength, or dispersity, which is  totally different from the QDs prepared by the classical method  with OA and OAm.  In that system, the emission wavelength  red-shifted gradually (Figure S6, Supporting Information) with  an obvious increase of particle size after washing. In contrast,  for the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs here, the emission wavelength and absorption peaks remained steady with little shift (Figure 3b).  \n\nIn addition to the robust purification endurance, the QDs  maintained their high PL QY   $(>\\!90\\%)$   without obvious deterioration (Figure 3c). In contrast, the QDs prepared with either  OAm or OA exhibited a severe decrease in the QY values with  increased washing time. The difference can be attributed to  the strong interaction between DBSA and lead ions, as shown  by the DOSY results. During purification, the highly dynamic  OA and OAm could escape from the surface of QDs, resulting  in aggregation and an imperfect pass iv ation effect (Figure S7,  Supporting Information).  Herein, the sulfonate group chelates tightly to the exposed surface lead ions. The bound state is  maintained throughout the whole purification processes, so the  QDs are passivated efficiently, from beginning to end. The good  pass iv ation effect is also confirmed by the PL decay results, as  shown in Figure 3d. The three curves show very similar decay  behavior, with fitted lifetimes of 3.26, 3.79, and   $3.63~\\mathrm{ns}$  , respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information). The faster radiative  rate and high QY values of all the three samples again manifest  the strong interaction between sulfonate groups and lead ions  and good pass iv ation effect on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs.  \n\nUsually, after purification, the size of perovskite QDs  increase and the crystal lin it y improves (Figure S8, Supporting  Information). However, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images (Figure S9, Supporting Information)  manifest a stable particle size, around   $8~\\mathrm{~nm}$  , even after  five washes (Figure  3e), a finding that agrees well with the  observed stable emission peak. All particles exhibit obvious  lattice fringe, indicating the good crystal lin it y of these QDs.  The QDs maintained their crystal lin it y and similar X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were observed as shown in Figure 3f.  The full width at half maximum values of all the curves were  similar for the different QDs. These results are consistent with  the unchanged particle size observed in transmission electron  microscopy (TEM) images. The most significant influence of  purification is the modulation of surface states; for the perovskite QDs, the effect is usually negative. Figure   ${3\\mathrm{g}}$   shows the  XPS results of samples washed for different times. One can  see there is no obvious binding energy shift for the Pb 4f  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/0872dfcda39433c543f485a3dd38eb58f8f5fabba9923a35af4477123494f515-1727124278.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   Purification and washing stability of DBSA-QD optics, structure, and surface. a) Photograph of DBSA-QDs under daylight after 1–8 cycles  of purification. b) PL and absorption spectra of the DBSA-QDs. c) Normalized PL QY of QDs prepared with different strategies. d) PL decay,  e) size distribution, f) XRD patterns, and g) Pb 4f fine XPS curves of the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs.  \n\ncurves, implying stable surface states of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs.  Therefore, the purification process only eliminates the excessive solvent and ligands, and the anchored ligands remain  firmly bound at the surface. As a result, no new defects form  and the QDs maintain their excellent QY, consistent with the  PL decay results.  \n\nIn addition to the purification problem, storage stability is  also an important issue that must be addressed for practical  applications. On one hand, the highly dynamic ligand binding  of perovskite QDs makes these particles unstable. These QDs  aggregate together and grow into large crystals with single  crystal lin it y, even at a low colloidal concentration, leading to  redshifted emission and decreased efficiency (Figure S10,  Supporting Information). However, during storage, the large  change of temperature and destruction from moisture usually  aggravate the above disadvantages. Additionally, these behaviors are irreversible. Both OA- and OAm-capped   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs  underwent this kind of deterioration. As shown in  Figure    4 a  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/ea7ccef8592ac1b5769407cfa51abd373a6041a0b04d2e7e2290db81a2b0030c-1727124225.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   Long-term stability with storage. a) Images of OAm and DBSA  capped QD dispersions under daylight and UV light after five months  storage. b) PL QY variation of the above corresponding samples after  different storage times.  \n\nand Figure S11, Supporting Information, the colloidal solution  of these two samples changed from clear and transparent to  cloudy due to the formation of large particles. The emission  peaks increased from 517 and   $511\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   to 520 and   $513.5\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ,  respectively (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Additionally, after five months, the QY of these two samples decreased  greatly, to only   $55\\%$   and   $26\\%$   of their initial values (Figure 4b;  Figure S13, Supporting Information). The decrease of QY was  also revealed by the images under UV lamp, and OA-capped  QDs exhibited better stability than OAm-capped QDs.  \n\nIn contrast to these disappointing findings, DBSA-capped  QDs exhibited robust storage stability.
