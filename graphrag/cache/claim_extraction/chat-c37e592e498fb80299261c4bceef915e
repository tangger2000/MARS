Results and Discussion  \n\nWe prepared the nano crystals by adding the bi-ligands to the  ${\\mathsf{C s P b B r}}_{3}$   nano crystals to obtain mixed halide nano crystals. The electronegativity of the I ions in the AHI and OI ligands, possessing a high electron density, enables them to act as electron donors for coordinating with unsaturated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$    ions to eﬀectively reduce halide vacancies by coordinating lead defects on the nano crystal surface, which would otherwise act as non radiative recombination centers ( Figure  1 a ). We optimized the ratio of the   $\\mathrm{Br/I}$   ratio to obtain desirable emission at  ${\\approx}630$   nm and tune the ratio between the two ligands to maximize the pas siva ting eﬀect (Figure  1c ).  \n\nWe employ density functional of theory to investigate the role of combination of AHI/OI in pas siva ting the traps and preventing halide segregation. We calculate the binding energies   $(E_{\\mathrm{b}})$   of AHI/OI, using long oleate ligands as the control. The calculated  $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   values of AHI/OI are ﬁvefold higher than the original oleate ligands (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). To better illustrate the bi-ligand strategy in preventing halide segregation, we also calculate the activation energy for halide migration with and without AHI/OI treatment. Compared to the nano crystals without ligand pass iv ation   $(1.925\\,\\mathrm{eV})$  , the activation energy for halide migration of control and treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nano crystals are 2.056 and  $2.155~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively, indicating the role of combination of AHI/OI in mitigating halide segregation (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information).  \n\nWe employed time-correlated single-photon counting to investigate the carrier dynamics of  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nano crystals with biligands treatment, using the original oleate ligand as the control (Figure  1d ). The control  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms exhibit a lifetime of 9 ns, whereas the treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms have an average  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/c8ab7449c312c1aaac0485dafc39a063170b048f09e86a3523616f9f8f9b8b17-1727106092.jpg)  \nFigure 2.  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{x}/\\mathsf{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms.

The longer lifetime after bi-ligand treatment suggests a reduction of non-radiative decay centers and halogen ion vacancies within the nano crystals. We measured the PLQY of control  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms and  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms with bi-ligand treatment. The control  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms show a PLQY of   $80\\%$  . The PLQY increases up to  $92\\%$   when we treated the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$  with bi-ligand strategy (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). This improvement coincides with time-resolved photo luminescence lifetime, and is attributed to the eﬀective reduction in crystal defects within the nano crystals, resulting in an overall enhancement of emission eﬃciency.  \n\nThe X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) indicates the presence of a cubic phase with a lattice constant of   $8.2\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  , and the XRD peaks at   $14.8^{\\circ}$  ,   $20.8^{\\circ}$  , and   $29.6^{\\circ}$   in both control and treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms suggest that the incorporation of AHI/OI into the nano crystals did not alter the perovskite crystal structures (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). We performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tests on control and treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nano crystals, revealing the size uniformity of treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nano crystals as shown in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). Furthermore, high-resolution TEM also certiﬁes that treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms have good dispersion and uniformity (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). We employed Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to probe the surface ligand states of the nano crystals. The treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$  ﬁlms exhibit increased intensity of C ─ H stretching peaks at 1466, 2854, and  $2926\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , indicating that the introduction of AHI further enhances the pass iv ation of OI (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information). We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize the composition and structure of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nanocrystals, which displays the standard bonding energy of Cs, Pb, Br, and I elements (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). The Pb 4f peak position of the treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nano crystals is shifted to lower binding energy related to control ﬁlms, suggesting the environmental composition changes and the electron density around  $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$    increases with the introduction of AHI as previous reported. 26 ]   Furthermore, we compared the integrated intensity of halogen signals, and quantitatively determined the ratio of  $\\mathrm{Br/I}$  is 1:3.  \n\nUsing temperature-dependent photo luminescence spectroscopy, we investigated the dynamics of photo generated excitons in the control and treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms. We monitored the emission characteristics of the two   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$  ﬁlms, and found all  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms show a slight increase in integrated PL intensity with decreasing temperature from 300 to  $100~\\mathrm{{K\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
