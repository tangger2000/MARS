materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, traditional NIR light sources, such as  halogen lamps and tungsten lamps, suffer  from several deficiencies, including large  sizes, low efficiency, short lifetime, and  poor matching degree with infrared detectors, etc., which provide the impetus to  explore new efficient NIR emitters.  \n\n$\\Upsilon\\mathfrak{b}^{3+}$   doped lead-free double per ovsk ites (DPs) with near-infrared (NIR)- emitting have attracted extensive attention due to their wide application  prospects. Unfortunately, they still suffer from weak NIR emission due to  undesirable resonance energy transfer between the sensitize rs and   $\\Upsilon{\\mathfrak{b}}^{3+}$   ions.  Herein, a new effective NIR-emitting DP is developed by co-doping  $\\mathtt{S b^{3+}}$   and   $\\Upsilon\\mathfrak{b}^{3+}$   into   $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g l n C l}_{6}$  . Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that  induced by co-doping   $\\mathtt{S b^{3+}}$   ions, the self-trapped excitation (STE) emission  intensity of  $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g l n C l}_{6}$   is greatly enhanced by 240 times, and the STE emission shifts from  $\\mathbf{600\\,nm}$   to  ${\\bf660\\,n m}$  , which contributes to a larger spectral  overlap between STE emission and the absorption of  $\\Upsilon\\mathfrak{b}^{3+}$   ions. As a result,  the absolute NIR photo luminescence quantum yield reaches an unprecedented  $\\mathbf{50\\%}$   in lead-free DPs via high-efficiency STE sensitization   $\\wp\\mathfrak{z}\\mathfrak{o}\\%\\mathfrak{z}$  .  The excellent optical performance of   $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g l n C l}_{6}$  : Sb, Yb with high ambient,  thermal and light stability makes it suitable for application in night-vision  devices. Moreover, an ingenious dual-modal optical information encryption  based on the combination of visible and NIR fluorescence printing patterns  utilizing   $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g l n C l}_{6}$  : Sb and  $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g l n C l}_{6},$  : Sb, Yb respectively is successfully  demonstrated. This study provides inspiration for designing highly efficient  NIR-emitting  ${\\mathsf{L}}{\\mathsf{n}}^{3+}$  -doped DPs and illustrates their great potential in versatile  op to electronic applications.  \n\nRecently, as a new generation of luminescent materials, lead halide per ovsk ites  (LHPs) with NIR photo luminescence  (PL) have attracted a tremendous amount  of interest and extensive research in the  field of photoelectric materials.  However, LHPs have to face severe challenges  in practical applications due to poor stability and the intrinsic toxicity of lead.

However, singly doped   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AMCl}_{6}$   double perovskites (DPs) show weak NIR emission because of its poor  optical absorption and forbidden f-f transition of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions. For  instance, photo luminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of NIR  emission in  $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   bulk crystals and nanocrystals is only   ${\\approx}3{-}4\\%$   respectively.  The PLQY in   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   doped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$   thin films is   ${\\approx}28\\%$  .  Therefore, how to improve  the NIR emission efficiency of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AMCl}_{6}$     $\\mathrm{DPS;Yb^{3+}}$   becomes  a hot issue.  Recently, researchers found co-doping   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   or  alloying  $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   ions can boost   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$  -related NIR emission in DPs.  For example, Nag and Chen et al. reported that co-doped   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$  ions in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   DPs enhance the excitation efficiency and  act as sensitize rs for both self-trapped exciton (STE) emission  and NIR emission of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions, which improves the NIR emission of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   in comparison with singly doped   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   in   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g\\cdot}$   $\\mathrm{InCl}_{6}$   DPs.  Nevertheless, STEs take away part of the absorbed  energy and cannot transfer their energy to   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions, leading  to low sensitization efficiency and weak luminescence of   ${\\mathrm{Yb}}^{3+}$  ions. Besides co-doping  $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   ions, Zhang and Chen et al. found  alloying  $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   in DPs can also increase the NIR luminescence of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions.  By virtue of the   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  -induced breakdown of local  site symmetry of the DPs, the absorption significantly increases,  followed by energy transfer to the STE states and then to  ${^2}\\mathrm{F}_{5/2}$  of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  . Unfortunately, due to the lack of resonance condition  (limited overlap between STE emission and   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   absorption  profiles), the energy transfer efficiency is only   $7\\%.^{[10a]}$   Similarly,   $\\mathrm{Wi}$   and Lin et al. reported   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}(\\mathrm{Na}/\\mathrm{Ag})\\mathrm{InCl}_{6}$  DPs.  The NIR emission of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions is enhanced by energy  transfer from STEs, but the energy transfer efficiency reported  by  $\\mathrm{Wi}$   et al\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
