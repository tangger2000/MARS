The crystal structure of $\\alpha{\\mathrm{F}}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}{\\mathrm{bl}}_{3}$ is the cubic aristotype perovskite and consists of corner-sharing $[\\mathrm{PbI}_{6}]^{4-}$ octahedra spanning to three directions, while $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$ reside in the cubo-octahedral cavities charge balancing the structure (Figure 1a). For the cubic $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$, the lattice parameter $(a)$ is 6.3620(8) $\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}_{:}$, which equals the distance between two $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$. In $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$, the ion radius of $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}=2.53\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$ and $\\mathrm{I^{-}}=2.20\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$, thus $a$ lattice parameter should be $\\sqrt{2}(r_{\\mathrm{FA}}+r_{\\mathrm{I}})=6.6892$ Å, much longer than the experimental value. Therefore, lattice stress exists in the $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$ perovskite crystal structure because of the ionic size mismatch between the FA cation and the $[\\mathrm{PbI}_{6}]^{4-}$ cage, resulting in the cage distortion and tilting, as reported in the literatures. This lattice strain is also the origin of the thermodynamic instability of this material which gives rise to the thermodynamically stable at room temperature non-perovskite yellow phase $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$. The stress can be relieved at least partially by forming vacancy point defects due to low formation energy. As depicted in Figure 1b (left part), both $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$ vacancies (point defects) can form in $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$ to reduce lattice stress. The lattice stress of the cubic phase $(\\alpha{\\mathrm{FAPbI}}_{3})$ ) however is best released spontaneously by transforming into yellow $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$, as the single crystal photographs and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Figure 1c (upper part) and Figure 1d. In contrast, one can also reduce the lattice stress without transforming to the yellow phase by incorporating smaller cations like $C s^{+}$ (1.69 Å), $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$ (2.17 Å), and/or anions $\\mathrm{Br^{-}\\ (1.96\\ \\mathring{A})}$ into the “overcrowded lattice structure” to replace part of $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$ (2.53 Å) and $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$ (2.20 Å) ions. As illustrated in Figure 1b (right part), the incorporation of smaller ions helps suppress the formation of vacancy defects in $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$, making the 3-cation mixed-halide FAMACs SCs more stable.

"input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Furthermore, the undesirable  phase transition and phase segregation that are notorious in  the FA based per ovsk ites are found suppressed, as evidenced  by much reduced dark current and significantly enhanced stability. These excellent properties enable us to design and fabricate a highly sensitive stable X-ray imaging system with the  following remarkable features: 1) the X-ray detectors fabricated using the FAMACs SCs present the highest sensitivity of   $(3.5\\pm0.2)\\times10^{6}~\\upmu\\mathrm{C}~\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   among all perovskite devices  reported to date, this value is more than 3 orders of magnitude  better than that of the state-of-the-art commercial   $\\alpha{\\cdot}S\\mathrm{e}$   detectors   $(440\\,\\,\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ; 2) The detection limit as low as   $42\\mathrm{~nGy_{air}~s^{-1}}$   is realized on the FAMACs SCs, 131 times lower  than what used in regular medical diagnostics   $(5.5~\\mu\\mathrm{Gy_{\\mathrm{air}}~s^{-1}})$  ;  3) the FAMACs SC X-ray detector shows stable response even  under high bias, much better than what reported in   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$   SC  and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   SC X-ray detectors; 4) FAMACs SC shows higher  hardness than other popular perovskite SCs; 5) the above  advantages, therefore, enable FAMACs SC detector array to  realize high-contrast X-ray imaging. This synergistic enhancement of multi-cation and mixed-halide strategy, together with  inch-sized single crystal growth could enable highly stable  high-performance new-generation X-ray detection systems.  \n\nCompared  with  the  popular   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   perovskite, the   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{F}}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}{\\mathrm{bl}}_{3}$   is known for its better device performance,  however, this material is thermodynamic ally unstable at room  temperature.

For the cubic   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , the lattice parameter   $(a)$    is 6.3620(8)   $\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}_{:}$  , which equals the distance between two   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  .   In   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , the ion radius of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}=2.53\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   and   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}=2.20\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$  , thus   $a$   lattice parameter should be   $\\sqrt{2}(r_{\\mathrm{FA}}+r_{\\mathrm{I}})=6.6892$   Å, much  longer than the experimental value. Therefore, lattice stress  exists in the   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   perovskite crystal structure because of the  ionic size mismatch between the FA cation and the   $[\\mathrm{PbI}_{6}]^{4-}$    cage, resulting in the cage distortion and tilting, as reported  in the literatures.  This lattice strain is also the origin of the  thermodynamic instability of this material which gives rise to  the thermodynamic ally stable at room temperature non-perovskite yellow phase   $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$  .

As illustrated in  Figure 1b (right part), the incorporation of smaller ions helps  suppress the formation of vacancy defects in   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , making  the 3-cation mixed-halide FAMACs SCs more stable. In this  work, we report the successful growth of high-quality, 3-cation  mixed-halide   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.1}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.05}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2.55}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.45}$  with optimized  composition perovskite single crystals. As large as inch-sized  high-quality FAMACs SCs were grown as shown in Figure 1c  (lower part), with more experimental details provided in the  Supporting Information. Compared with the   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   SCs, the  FAMACs SCs are phase stable even exposed in ambient environment for 60 days. Figure 1e shows the powder XRD patterns  of the FAMACs SCs, with absence of non-perovskite diffraction  peaks during the 60-day test period.  \n\nIn per ovsk ites, vacancies enable pathways for ion migration.  To assess the ion migration level in the present FAMACs SCs,  temperature-dependent conductivity was measured in dark.  Generally, electronic conduction is the main cause of conductivity at low-temperature as the ion migration is suppressed.  In this work, the ion migration rate of the FAMACs SCs was  characterized by the activation energy   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$   of ionic conductivity,  calculated using the Nernst–Einstein equation from the temperature-dependent measurements  \n\n$$\n\\sigma\\left(T\\right)=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\scriptscriptstyle0}}{T}\\,\\exp\\left({-\\frac{E_{\\scriptscriptstyle a}}{k_{\\scriptscriptstyle B}T}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere   $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$   is the Boltzmann constant,   $\\sigma_{0}$   a constant, and   $T$  the temperature. The conduct iv i ties of the SC devices were  extracted by fitting the   $I{-}V$  curves in the high-temperature  region,  as shown in Figure  1f. The ionic conductivity (ion  migration) activation energy was calculated to be   $0.77\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for  the FAMACs SC, while a smaller value of   $0.53~\\mathrm{eV}$   is calculated  for the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   SC, suggesting that by incorporating smaller  ions, the number of vacancy defects is effectively reduced in  the FAMACs SCs, so is the ion migration.  Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows that the FAMACs SCs also exhibit  enhanced thermal stability when compared to the   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$   SCs.  \n\nXRD is used to evaluate the quality of the FAMACs SC.
