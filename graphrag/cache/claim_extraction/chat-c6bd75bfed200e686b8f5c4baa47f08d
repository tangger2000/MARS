Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

An ultrasonic treatment was  applied during the synthesis to promote the reaction and prevent potential agglomeration of the product.

The  Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement demonstrated  a low specific surface area of only   $2.3\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{g}^{-1}$  , and micro- and  mesopores were not indicated in the isotherm profile (Figure S1,  Supporting Information). After the   $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$   treatment at ambient  conditions, the particle size was greatly reduced, as demonstrated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation  (Figure 1b,c). An  ${\\approx}68.$  -fold enhanced surface area and abundant  mesopores were obtained compared to those of the original LN  (Figure S1 and Table S1, Supporting Information). The SEM  image of the a-LNF(b-u) sample was shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). It is well known that the perovskite structure can stabilize unusually high oxidation states of transition  metals, such as   $^{4+}$   for cobalt and   $^{3+}$   for nickel.  The X-ray  adsorption spectrum (XAS) confirmed the   $^{3+}$  oxidation state of  nickel in the LN perovskite (Figure S3, Supporting Information).  \n\nAs displayed in Figure  1a, the a-LNF(t-d) sample showed  no diffraction peaks. According to the high-resolution  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, the LN  sample showed clear lattice fringes (Figure  1d) with a   $d$  -spacing of 2.72 Å corresponding to the (110) diffraction  plane, whereas the a-LNF(t-d) sample showed no obvious  lattice fringes (Figure  1e). The corresponding selectedarea electron diffraction pattern (SAED, inset of Figure  1e)  also confirmed the amorphous nature of the a-LNF(t-d)  sample. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  (ICP-MS) revealed a mole ratio of 1:6:4 for   $\\mathrm{{La/Ni/}}$  Fe (Table S2,  Supporting Information) in the a-LNF(t-d) sample. The La, Ni,  Fe, and O were distributed uniformly in the a-LNF(t-d) sample  as revealed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping  (EDX, Figure  1f). To support the selective corrosion of   $\\mathrm{La}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$    that contributed to the increased specific surface area and the  introduction of mesopores, NiO and   $\\mathrm{La}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   were also treated  with   $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$   solution for   $2\\textrm{h}$  . It was found that NiO remained  its crystalline structure with almost no change in specific surface area, whereas   $\\mathrm{La}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   lost all diffraction peaks and had a  substantially increased specific surface area (Figures S4 and S5,  and Table S1 in the Supporting Information).   $\\mathrm{La}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   was transformed into crystalline   $\\mathrm{La(OH)}_{3}$   in deionized water (Figure S6,  Supporting Information), demonstrating that the presence  of   $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$   is necessary during the a morph iz ation process. The  above analysis clearly demonstrated the successful application  of the top-down strategy and confirmed the proposed selective  dissolution-deposition procedure.  \n\nThe OER catalytic performance of the prepared samples was  evaluated in an   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated   $1.0\\;\\mathrm{~M~}\\:\\mathrm{KOH}$   solution.

A  much smaller onset potential was required for the a-LNF(t-d)  electrode to launch the OER than that of the pristine LN. At   $10\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , a noticeable reduction of   $183\\,\\mathrm{\\mV}$   in overpotential was achieved from the pristine LN to the a-LNF(t-d) catalyst. The a-LNF(t-d) exhibited   ${\\approx}77$   times higher mass activity  than that of the pristine LN at an over potential of   $300\\:\\mathrm{\\mV}$  (Figure 2b). The excellent OER activity was also revealed by the  Tafel slope (Figure 2c). In our case, the a-LNF(t-d) sample was  found to have a Tafel slope of only   $36~\\mathrm{mV}$   per decade, which  is much smaller than the   $115\\,\\mathrm{\\mV}$   per decade of the pristine  LN sample. This suggests that the rate-determination step was  changed  after the treatment of LN with   $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$  . The a-LNF(td) electro catalyst also showed favorable operating stability, providing a stable  $10\\:\\mathrm{mA}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   current density for a period of  $100\\,\\mathrm{h}$  without an obvious potential increase, which is superior to that  of the pristine LN (Figure 2d). For the crystalline samples (LN  and c-LNF), the doping of Fe can reduce the over potential and  increase the surface area, which benefit to the structural ­ stability  of the electrode materials (catalyst, conductive carbon, and  binder) and the release of oxygen bubble, respectively, both have  positive effect on the OER stability. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of these four catalysts (Figure S7, Supporting Information) indicates that the a-LNF(t-d) catalyst exhibits  much lower charge transfer resistance than the other three catalyst\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
