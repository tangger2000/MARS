Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The detailed properties of the   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics  are summarized in  Table   1 , where   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and   $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$   are determined  from the   $P{-}E$   loops, while   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$   are determined from  the current–electric field   $(I{-}E)$   curve as shown in Figure S2 \n\n (Supporting Information). It is found that   $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$   remains at \n\n  $35.5{-}37.2~\\upmu\\mathrm{C~cm}^{-2}$   for the compositions of   $x\\,=\\,0{-}15\\,\\mathrm{\\mol{\\%}}$  ,  slightly decreases to   $31.5~\\upmu\\mathrm{C}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at   $x=20~\\mathrm{mol}\\%$  , due to the  limitation of   $E_{\\flat}$  . Of particular significance is that the   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   is found  to decrease with increasing Ta addition, while both  $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$   are  found to exhibit a contrary trend, with the switching hysteresis   $\\Delta E$   maintaining the same values. The reduced   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and increased   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}/E_{\\mathrm{A}}$   reveal an enhanced anti ferro electricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$  ceramics, benefiting the energy storage density.  As expected,  all the   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics are found to possess higher   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}>3.0~\\mathrm{J}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   and   $\\eta>58\\%$   when compared to their pure  counterpart, as shown in Figure 1b, indicating the substitution  of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   for   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$   plays an important role in increasing energy  storage density and decreasing energy dissipation. The highest   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   up to   $4.2~\\mathrm{J~cm}^{-3}$  , an enhancement of   $260\\%$   over the pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramic, is achieved in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$   ceramics,  with good thermal stability of the energy storage density (minimal variation of   $\\mathord{<}\\pm5\\%$  ) over temperature range of   ${20}–120\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ,  as given in Figure 1c. The good thermal stability of the energy  storage density is attributed to the existence of  $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$   phase over a  broad temperature range, which has been tuned to room temperature by adding   $\\mathrm{AgTaO}_{3}$   component. With increasing temperature, the  $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$   phase is stabilized due to the fact that higher  temperature favors the short-range interaction and enhances  the AFE phase stability, playing a positive impact on the thermal  stability of the energy storage density. The energy storage densities of recently studied lead-free ceramics are summarized in  Figure 1d. It can be seen that the   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   of   $4.2\\ \\mathrm{J\\cm^{-3}}$   achieved  in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$   ceramic is superior to all other studied  lead-free ceramics,  demonstrating   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   is  a potential candidate for energy storage applications. To understand the underlying mechanism for the enhanced energy  storage density in  $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, the micro structure  observation, dielectric property measurement and polar state  study by SAED are performed on   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   solid solution.  \n\nA relative density above   $95\\%$   is obtained for all the samples, in addition, the   $\\mathrm{Ta}$  -doped ceramics are found to possess  smaller grain size comparing to pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   (  $2.5\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{{m}}$   in   $x=$   $20\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\%$   vs   $52~\\ensuremath{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   in   $x\\,=\\,0\\,\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\%)$  ), due to the refractory  nature of Ta,  as shown in small insets of  Figure   2 a. The  reduced grain size and high density would contribute to the  enhanced dielectric breakdown strength   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$  , which is a key  factor benefiting the high energy storage performance. The  data of   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   are plotted by Weibull distribution and given in  Figure 2b. The average   $E_{\\flat}$   determined by fitting lines is found  to increase with Ta addition, with values being on the order of  175 and   $240\\ensuremath{~\\mathrm{kV}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}$   for pure ceramics and   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.80}T a_{0.20})}$   $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  , respectively.  \n\nFigure 2c shows the variations of dielectric constant as  a function of temperature for pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics. It  is observed that the phase transitions for   $\\mathrm{M}_{1}–\\mathrm{M}_{2}\\left(T_{\\mathrm{M}_{1}-\\mathrm{M}_{2}}\\right)$  ,   $\\mathrm{M}_{2}–\\mathrm{M}_{3}\\left(T_{\\mathrm{M}_{2}-\\mathrm{M}_{3}}\\right)$  , and   $\\mathrm{M}_{3}–\\mathrm{O}$     $\\left(T_{\\mathrm{M_{3}-O}}\\right)$   occur approximately at 75,  262, and   $355~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , respectively. Same measurements were performed on   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, based on which, the  phase diagram is determined and plotted in Figure 2d. The  phase transition temperature   $T_{\\mathrm{O-T}}$   which relates to the oxygen  octahedron tilting, is found to increase with Ta addition, while   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{2}-M_{3}}}$   and   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{1}-M_{2}}}$  , which are associated with the cation (  $\\mathrm{Ag}$   and  Nb) displacements, exhibit contrary trend. Of particular interest  is that   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{3}-O}}$  , which is between   $T_{\\mathrm{O-T\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
