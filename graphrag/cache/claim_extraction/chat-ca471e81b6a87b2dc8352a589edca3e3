Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The reaction mixture was  centrifuged at 8000 rpm for   $\\mathsf{T0}\\,\\mathsf{r n i n}$   to discard the precipitates containing  large particles. After that, a clear colloidal suspension of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QDs  was obtained. The   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QDs in toluene was obtained in the same  way as the procedures for ethanol, but simply change the anti solvent. The  solid powders of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QDs were obtained by gradient cent ri fuga tion  at 5000 rpm and then 10 000 rpm both for   $\\mathsf{T0}\\,\\mathsf{r n i n}$  .   ${\\sf C s}_{3}{\\sf B i}_{2}{\\sf C l}_{9}$   and  $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{9}$  QDs were synthesized by varying the precursors following a similar  strategy. The synthesis of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}(\\mathsf{C l},~\\mathsf{B r})_{9}$   and   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}(\\mathsf{B r},\\mathsf{\\Omega}|)_{9}$   QDs was  achieved by varying the ratio of reactant sources (CsCl, CsBr, CsI,   ${\\mathsf{B i C}}|_{3}$  ,   ${\\mathsf{B i B r}}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathsf{B i l}_{3},$  ) in the preparation of precursor solutions.  \n\nFabrication of   $C s_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}$  QD/Silica Matrix : 3 mL TEOS,   $0.8~\\mathsf{m L}$   ethanol  or QD ethanol solution, and  $0.5~\\mathsf{m L}$   DI water were subsequently added  to   $25~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   glass bottle, and then a trace amount of HBr was dropped into  mixture until the value of   $\\mathsf{P H}$   reached to 3. In this system, QD solution  served as the solvent and it can also suppress the gelling rate of TEOS.  After vigorous stirring at   $36~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $^\\mathrm{~4~h~}$  , a colorless and transparent  solution was formed. Afterward, lid of the bottle was opened and  magneton was taken out. Finally, composite was successfully fabricated  a day later.  \n\nFabrication of   $C s_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}$  QD/Silica Film : After the formation of the   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QD–hydrolytic TEOS solution, lid of the bottle was opened.  The solution became ropy several minutes later.   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QD/silica  film was prepared by dropping the ropy solution on quartz at the room  temperature and then gelling in air naturally.  \n\nFabrication of W-LED Devices : The QD/silica composite powder was  blended with yellow YAG phosphor powder with a mass ratio of 10:1.  Then, the mixed powder was painted on the surface of the violet chip.  \n\nStructural Characterizations : The XRD experiments were performed  using Philips   $\\mathsf{X}$   pert pro MRD diffract o meter with the   $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K o}$  radiation.  TGA results of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$  and   $\\mathsf{M A}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   single crystals were obtained  using a Perkin Elmer Diamond TG/DTA6300, conducted at a heating rate  of   $10^{\\cdot}{\\mathsf{o}}_{\\mathsf{\\Omega}}\\,{\\mathsf{c}}_{\\mathsf{m i n}^{-1}}$   to  $800~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   in   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   flow with an alumina crucible. The surface  of single crystals and QDs of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   were analyzed using XPS with Al   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  excitation (Genesis, EDAX Inc., 300 W). TEM (TecnaiG2 20U-TWIN)  was applied to characterize the   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QDs. The as-synthesized QD  samples were deposited on amorphous-carbon-coated copper grids.  \n\nOptical  Characterizations :  The  transmission  and  absorption  spectra were measured on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer  Instruments, Lambda 950). PL measurements of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{X}_{9}$   QDs were  carried out using an Edinburgh Instruments Ltd UC920. The absolute  PLQYs of the diluted   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{X}_{9}$   QD solution were determined using a  fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh FLS980 spec tro flu oro meter) with  an integrated sphere. Samples were excited at a wavelength of   $330\\ \\mathsf{n m}$    using a xenon lamp source. The time-resolved PL spectra were collected  on an Edinburgh Instruments Ltd EPL-340. Excitation wavelengths  were collected at   $370\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   for QDs and   $467\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   for single crystals. The  temperature-dependent PL spectrum measurements were recorded  using Horiba JobinYvon, LabRAM HR800 spectrometer and excited  with a   $340~\\mathsf{n m}$   laser with temperature ranging from 80 to   $300~\\mathsf{K}$   using a  liquid helium cooler. The light source used in photo stability study was a   $365\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   UV lamp (JIAP ENG, ZF-05, China).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nM.L. and Y.Y. contributed equally to this work.
