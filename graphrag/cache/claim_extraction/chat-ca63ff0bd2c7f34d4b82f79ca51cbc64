Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.

The O 1s XPS results indicate that during OER process,  NiCo alloy has been hydroxyl a ted because the rich   ${C0}^{3+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}}$   might be beneficial to form the surface-hydrated oxides  and (oxy)hydroxides phases (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{Co(OH)}_{2},$  , CoOOH,   $\\mathrm{Ni(OH)}_{2}.$  ,  and NiOOH).  And those surface-hydrated oxides and (oxy) hydroxides species could provide the main reactive sites, which  might attribute to the enhancement during the OER process of  the sample with the loading of NiCo alloy nanoparticles.  As  shown in Figure 7d, C 1s can be de convoluted into   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$  ,  $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$  ,  and   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   whether before or after OER. In addition, after OER  process, the intensities of   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$  ,   $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   have not been  changed a lot, indicating that the carbon nanofibers are relatively stable during OER process.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, here we reported a simple and successful  approach for the synthesis of NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on N-doped carbon nanofibers as a highly active and  durable oxygen electro catalyst with low-cost. The hybrid catalyst with the right amount of NiCo alloy nanoparticles loading   $\\langle\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2\\rangle$  ) gives the most prominent ORR and OER electro catalytic performances, characterized with the most positive  specific potential (0.81 V vs RHE) at   $-3\\,\\,\\mathrm{mA\\,\\,cm}^{-2}$  , maximum  current densities of ORR   $(-6.54\\mathrm{~mA}\\mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$   at 0.06 V) and OER  (  $16.80\\,\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$   at   $1.96~\\mathrm{~V~}$  , which are even superior to the  commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   catalysts, respectively. Besides,  the   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   owns the smallest Tafel plot slopes for both  the ORR   $(-65~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1})$  ) and OER   $(98\\:\\mathrm{mV}\\:\\mathrm{dec}^{-1})$  ) processes. The  synergetic effects between NiCo alloy nanoparticles and the  N-doped carbon fiber have been ascribed to the excellent catalytic activities of the hybrid catalyst, including of decreasing the  intrinsic and charge transfer resistances, increasing   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=C}}$  , graphitic-N/pyridinic-N contents in the hybrid catalyst, and the formation of highly active hydroxyl ation of   $\\mathrm{Ni/Co}$  . In addition, the  testing results of zinc–air batteries indicate that   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}\\hat{\\lambda}$  can be a feasible, highly efficient, and stable air catalyst with  low-cost. This work might open a simple and novel way to fabricate high-efficient, low-cost oxygen catalysts with high production, and shows great potential applications in various  renewable energy systems including fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and water splitting.  \n\n# 4.
