{"result": "## (DLCH<|>SnO2<|>CHEMICAL INTERACTION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>DLCH interacts chemically with SnO2, as evidenced by a noticeable shift in the binding energies of Sn 3d peaks in XPS measurements. The interaction is further supported by the FTIR and 13C NMR results, which show changes in the stretching vibration peaks of DLCH functional groups after mixing with SnO2.<|>The chemical interaction of DLCH with SnO2 or perovskite was investigated by performing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As depicted in Figure 2a, both pristine and modified SnO2 films exhibited discernible Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 peaks. Evidently, a noticeable shift in the binding energies of these peaks can be observed from 487.3 (Sn3d5/2) and 495.7 eV (Sn3d3/2) for the bare SnO2 film to 486.1 and 494.5 eV for the SnO2 film modified with DLCH, respectively. This shift strongly suggests a chemical interaction between DLCH and SnO2. The FTIR full spectra of the pristine and modified SnO2 films are exhibited in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). It can be seen in Figure 2d that the C=O stretching vibration peak of DLCH (1743 cm^-1) was shifted toward a lower wavenumber for DLGH/SnO2 (1738 cm^-1). In Figure 2e, the -SH peak of DLCH (2549 cm^-1) was moved to a higher wavenumber (2552 cm^-1) after mixing with SnO2. This shows that C=O and -SH jointly participated in the coordination of uncoordinated Sn4+ in the SnO2 film. After the uncoordinated Sn4+ was reduced, the Ov vacancy was naturally suppressed, which is consistent with reduced oxygen vacancy defects as revealed by the O 1s XPS result. To gain deeper insights into the interaction between the functional group in DLCH molecules and SnO2, we conducted 13C NMR spectra measurements (Figure 2f). The 13C NMR analysis demonstrated a chemical shift alteration from 170.37 to 170.40 ppm subsequent to the mixing of DLCH with SnO2. The aforementioned 13C NMR findings once more substantiated the chemical interaction between C=O and Sn4+, aligning coherently with the previous XPS and FTIR results.<|>(DLCH<|>Perovskite<|>CHEMICAL INTERACTION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>DLCH also interacts chemically with perovskite, as indicated by a shift in the binding energies of Pb 4f peaks in XPS measurements. The interaction is supported by FTIR results, which show changes in the stretching vibration peaks of DLCH functional groups after interacting with perovskite.<|>Subsequently, we further explored the interaction between perovskite and DLCH. From Figure 2g, the control perovskite film exhibited two peaks at 137.44 and 142.30 eV corresponding to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, respectively, which were shifted to lower binding energies following the DLCH modification (137.00 and 141.90 eV). This observation indicates a robust chemical interaction between DLCH and perovskite. The shift may occur because -C=O and -SH coordinated with uncoordinated Pb2+, and NH3+ formed hydrogen bonds with unsaturated iodide ions in the perovskite. The FT-IR spectra of the DLCH and perovskite film with DLCH are exhibited in Figure 2h-j and Figure S7 (Supporting Information). After interacting with perovskite, the stretching vibration peaks of -C=O (1743 cm^-1), -SH (2553 cm^-1), and -NH3+ (3407 cm^-1) in DLCH were shifted to 1589, 2596, and 3421 cm^-1, respectively. The formation of Pb-S bond (468 cm^-1) was also found (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Taken together, the XPS and FT-IR results together indicate that both -C=O and -SH in DLCH have the ability to chemically interact with under coordinated Pb2+.<|>##<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1.

In comparison, the average transmittance s of   $\\mathrm{{Sno}_{2}}$  -DLCH samples at 400, 625, and  $700\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   were 0.843, 0.892, and 0.878, respectively (Figure    $\\mathrm{S4g-j}$  , Supporting Information), which were higher than that of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  sample. In order to better demonstrate the uniformity of the surface transmittance of the sample, we intercepted a small part of the data in Figure  S4b–d,g–j  (Supporting Information) and displayed them in the form of contour maps in Figure  S4e–g,j–l (Supporting Information) respectively. Figure  S4e–g  (Supporting Information) shows that the average transmittance of the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  sample at 400, 625 and   $700\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   is 0.845, 0.877, and 0.859 respectively.

After DLCH adjustment, the light transmittance increased, which is consistent with the UV–vis light transmittance results in Figure  S5a  (Supporting Information). It is important to note that the light intensity  \n\non the surface of the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   sample is very uneven, which may be due to the loss of light transmission caused by the agglomeration and defects of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  . In comparison, the light intensity of the  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -DLCH sample is more uniform, which may be due to the suppression of agglomeration and reduction of defects after DLCH modi cation. It can be concluded that photons in ETL can be managed through DLCH modulation.  \n\nThe chemical interaction of DLCH with   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   or perovskite was investigated by performing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As depicted in  Figure  2 a , both pristine and modiﬁed   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ﬁlms exhibited discernible  $\\mathrm{Sn}\\,3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and Sn   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   peaks. Evidently, a noticeable shift in the binding energies of these peaks can be observed from 487.3   $(\\mathrm{Sn\\3d}_{5/2})$  ) and   $495.7~\\mathrm{eV}$     $(\\mathrm{Sn\\3d}_{3/2})$  for the bare   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ﬁlm to 486.1 and   $494.5~\\mathrm{eV}$   for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ﬁlm modiﬁed with DLCH, respectively. This shift strongly suggests a chemical interaction between DLCH and  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  . The O 1s peaks in the bare and modiﬁed   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ﬁlms have been successfully deconvoluted into a pair of distinct peaks (Figure  2b,c ). Spec i call y, the peak situated at a lower binding energy is attributed to the lattice oxygen   $(\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{L}})$   of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  , while the peak positioned at a higher binding energy corresponds to the vacancy oxygen   $(\\mathrm{O_{V}})$  . ]   The ratio of peak areas   $(\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{ov}})$  , reﬂecting  $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}}$   content, was determined using the approach outlined in our prior work. 19 ]   The calculated  $R_{\\mathrm{ov}}$   values for both the unmodiﬁed and DLCH-modiﬁed samples were 0.56 and 0.36, respectively. This shows that a notable decline in the concentration of oxygen vacancy defects was realized after DLCH modi cation. These ﬁndings collectively reinforced the chemical interaction between the DLCH and the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ﬁlm. The FTIR full spectra of the pristine and modiﬁed   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ﬁlms are exhibited in Figure  S6  (Supporting Information). It can be seen in Figure  2d  that the   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$   stretching vibration peak of DLCH   $(1743\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$  ) was shifted toward a lower wavenumber for\n\n  $\\mathrm{DLGH}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   $(1738\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ). In Figure  2e , the -SH peak of DLCH\n\n  $(2549\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ) was moved to a higher wavenumber   $(2552\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ) after mixing with  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  . This shows that   $\\scriptstyle\\cdot C=0$   and  $-S\\mathrm{H}$   jointly participated in the coordination of uncoordinated   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$    in the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ﬁlm. After the uncoordinated  $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$    was reduced, the  $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}}$   vacancy was naturally suppressed, which is consistent with reduced oxygen vacancy defects as revealed by the O 1s XPS result. To gain deeper insights into the interaction between the functional group in DLCH molecules and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  , we conducted    $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$   NMR spectra measurements (Figure  2f ). The  $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$   NMR analysis demonstrated a chemical shift alteration from 170.37 to 170.40 ppm subsequent to the mixing of DLCH with  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  .

This observation indicates a robust chemical interaction between DLCH and perovskite.
