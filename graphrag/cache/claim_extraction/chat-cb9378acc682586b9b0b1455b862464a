It reduces grain size and increases the number of nucleation sites, leading to a homogeneous and pinhole-free film. The hydrogen bonding interactions between PVA and the SnI6 lattice prevent the rotations of the nearby SnI6 octahedral frameworks, resulting in an oriented crystal growth of the perovskite lattice.<|>On adding PVA as an additive, the reduced grain size (100-300 nm) was observed due to the increasing number of nucleation sites. The presence of an optimum amount (3 mgmL^-1) of PVA could retard the crystal growth by hydrogen bonding interactions so that uniform nucleation can be achieved to form a homogeneous and pinhole-free perovskite films as shown in Figure 2c and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information.

Notably, the PL peak intensity was enhanced by 40% with the use of PVA as the additive in the FASnI3 film (Figure 3a). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) of the perovskite films on the glass substrates was also measured as shown in Figure 3b. The pristine FASnI3 film showed a characteristic PL lifetime of 0.69 ns.

As the dark curent–voltage curve went to trap-filled limit voltage (V_TFL), we can observe a steep rise in the current. The trap density calculated from V_TFL for the FASnI3–PVA film was 2.6x10^17 cm^-3, which is lower than that of the pristine FASnI3 film (3.5x10^17 cm^-3). Admittance spectra were also performed to investigate the trap density in the solar cell device with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PS/FAsn3 (with or without PVA) /C60/BCP/Ag (Figure 3d).
