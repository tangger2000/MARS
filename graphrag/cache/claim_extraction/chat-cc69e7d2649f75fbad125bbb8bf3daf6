Thermal annealing at various temperatures, ranging from 50 to   $250~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , for  $^{\\textrm{\\scriptsize1h}}$   are conducted to remove thiourea and increase  electron density. For comparison, solution-processed   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  nano crystal ESLs were prepared by direct spin coating of a precursor solution containing   $\\mathrm{SnCl}_{2}\\cdot2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   in ethanol on FTO  substrates, as reported by Ke et al.  The XRD and TEM analysis  illustrate that   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESL has better crystal lin it y than that  of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   NC ESL annealed at the same temperature of   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  .  The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey of elements  of a   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESL annealed at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   shows mostly Sn and  O with small concentration of S and N, confirming the formation of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The binding  energies of 487.11 and   $495.56~\\mathrm{eV}$   correspond to the   $\\mathrm{Sn}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}5/2$  and   $\\mathrm{Sn}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}3/2$   peaks, respectively. The O 1s spectrum exhibits  a lower binding energy   $(530.7\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   and a higher binding energy  (532.1 eV), which can be assigned to the   $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$   state in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and  the surface oxygen-group absorbance, respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (Figure S4 and Table S1,  Supporting Information) shows that there is still a large amount  of residual S and N in the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESL after annealing at  50 or   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for  $^{1\\textrm{h}}$  . As S-group vaporizes at higher annealing  temperatures, more oxygen vacancies are expected to form,  leading to a higher electron density/conductivity. XPS measurement is an effective method to monitor the evolution of element contents in thin films.  We have systematically analyze  the evolution of S an N contents in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD films annealed\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
