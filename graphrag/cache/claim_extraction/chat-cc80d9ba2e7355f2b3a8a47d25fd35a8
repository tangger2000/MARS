Most liquid crystals  are made of organic compounds. They are characterized by  the anisotropy of optical, electrical, and mechanical properties.  These properties are responsive to a variety of stimuli,  including the temperature, electric field, light, etc., which make  LCs broad interesting in applications.  Optical properties of LCs highly rely on the orientation  of anisotropic molecules. The thermo ch rom is m of LCs is  achieved by tuning the orientation in response to temperature  stimulus.  In a sandwich configuration smart window, LC  molecules can be tuned in a number of orientations between  two glass slides.  Figure   7 a shows three typical orientations of  LCs and the corresponding optical states that affect the incident  light perpendicular to the glass slide. When the molecules are  assembled in helical structures and parallel to the slides (planar  orientation), the incident light is reflected (reflective state). A  light scattering state form when the helical structures are randomly tilted in a focal conic orientation. The LCs perform to  be transparent when the molecules extend perpendicular to  the slides (home o tropic alignment). In scattering and reflective  states, the reflection band is determined by incident angle of  light, the pitch of LCs, and the refractive index of materials.  Thermo chromic films based on orientation transition of LCs  have been demonstrated as a good candidate for energy-efficient  smart windows. Ogiwara et  al. reported the thermal-induced  transmittance-to-diffraction states of holographic polymer–LC  composite.  The group of Yang has produced a series of thermochromic films based on the polymer–LC composites. In these  works, the LCs represented a light modulation in a broadband   $(400{-}2500\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   with strong control in visible range. They prepared a thermo chromic film based on a polymer stabilized LC,  while the planar orientation of LC molecules at low temperature  gave low solar energy transmittance, which is not desired.

For example,  they developed a dual-response film containing well-dispersed  ITO NCs and LC droplets in phase-separated polymer network  (Figure 7b).  The LC could be changed reversibly from focal  conic to home o tropic orientations by either thermal or electrical  field stimuli (Figure 7b1). In this case, the transition here was  also suggested as a smectric (SmA) to chiral nematic   $\\left(\\mathrm{N^{*}}\\right)$   phase  transition. The film was observed changes from opaque to  transparent appearances during the transition (Figure 7b2). On  the film with   $5~\\mathrm{wt\\%}$   ITO, it was demonstrated with a low NIR  transmittance   $(\\approx\\!15\\%)$   from 1400 to   $2500~\\mathrm{nm}$   as well as a huge  transmittance contrast at   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   up to   ${\\approx}70\\%$   between at 300  and 308 K (Figure 7c). The introduction of ITO NCs also slightly  decreased the transition temperature (Figure  7d), which was  explained as the effect of ITO NCs residue in the LC domain  after phase transition. It is worthy to mention that these films  are easily process able and were successfully produced in meter  scale by a roll-to-roll method (inset of Figure 7c).  Hybrid film was studied by Liang et  al. by combining the  electro chromic LC with the thermo chromic   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  .

The electro chromic s of LCs and thermo chromic s  of   $\\mathrm{W}{-}\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   NCs were maintained after combination and could  work independently, which made the stimulus-responsive film  display four optical states under different stimuli: low temperature/no electrical field, high temperature/no electrical field, low  temperature/electrical field, and high temperature/electrical  field (Figure 7e2). For example, the film with   $2.5~\\mathrm{wt\\%}$     $\\mathrm{W}{-}\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$    displayed decreasing transmittance in NIR spectrum range  under increasing temperature from 25 to   $55\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (Figure  7f).  The transmittance   $(400{-}2500\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) was further decreased by  increasing the applied voltage from 0 to   $35~\\mathrm{V}$   with a significant  depression in visible range (Figure  $7\\mathrm{g},$  ). The optimized   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   was  achieved up to   $34.6\\%$  , which is comparable to the hydrogel/  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$    hybrid.  # 2.6.
