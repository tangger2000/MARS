For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized.

Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date.

Hydrogen bonding strategy was previously used  for surface pass iv ation in the lead-based PSCs.  However,  in this work, the benefit of introducing hydrogen bonding in  the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  -based PSCs is to control the crystal growth and  thus form a compact perovskite film with reduced trap density.  In addition, the   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   hydrogen bonding interactions at the  grain boundary can suppress the iodide ions migration, which  is beneficial for the long-term stability of devices. Indeed, the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA PSCs attained higher PCE of   $8.9\\%$   under the  reverse scan with significantly improved   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   from 0.55 to   $0.63\\mathrm{~V~}$  by adding PVA. More importantly, the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA PSCs  exhibited striking long-term stability, with no decay in efficiency  after 400 hours of operation at the maximum power point. We  argue that the improved efficiency and stability is related to the  strong   $\\mathrm{O-H^{\\cdots}I^{-}}$   hydrogen bonding interactions between PVA  and   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  , which have the effects of introducing nucleation  sites, slowing down the crystal growth, directing the crystal orientation, reducing the trap states, and suppressing the iodide  ions migration.  \n\nWe first confirm the formation of hydrogen bonding interactions by using liquid-state   $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$   NMR measurement as shown  in  Figure   1 a. In the neat sample containing PVA in deuterated  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/1d2945eec4ab2f283cbfaa4ebc59dbd88c63c37e60cc9861304c4e1c42ba8895-1723834660.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   a)   $^1\\mathsf{H}$   NMR spectra of PVA,   $\\mathsf{P V A}\\,+\\,\\mathsf{S n I}_{2}$  , and   $\\mathsf{P V A}\\,+\\,\\mathsf{F A I}$   in  DMSO $d_{6}$   solution. b) Representation of the  $\\mathsf{O}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{H}\\mathrm{\\cdots}|^{-}$   hydrogen bonding  interaction. c) DFT calculation of the absorption energy of PVA to the   $\\mathsf{F A S nI}_{3}$   surface.  \n\ndimethyl sulfoxide  $\\cdot d_{6}$  (  $\\scriptstyle(\\mathrm{DMSO-}d_{6})$  ), resonance signals attributable to the hydroxy group appear at   $\\delta=4.2–4.8\\ \\mathsf{p p m}$  . On further addition of   $\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nI}_{2}$   or FAI into the PVA solution, resonance  signals arising from the -OH protons of PVA are obviously  broad, which is indicative of the   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   hydrogen bonding  interaction (Figure  1b). The broad line widths indicate a lack  of motion in the PVA molecule, originating from the strong   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$  hydrogen bonds that keep the position of the hydroxyl  groups fixed in the PVA molecule. Besides, the resonance signals of   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   and -CH in   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  are not obviously changed after  the addition of PVA, indicating that the interaction between   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   and PVA is weak and the main hydrogen bonding is  from the   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   interaction. According to Fourier transform  infrared spectroscopy (Figure S1, Supporting Information), the   $\\mathrm{O{-}H}$   stretch   $(3200{-}3500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ) of the PVA molecule was shifted  when   $\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nI}_{2}$   was included, which also indicates a chemical interaction of the hydroxy group with iodide ions. These results are  supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The  adsorption energy of PVA to the  ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   surface was calculated to  be  $-36.4\\;\\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}}$  , which was defined as   $\\Delta E=E[\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3}\\mathrm{-PVA}]\\,-$   $\\left\\{{E[\\mathrm{FAsn}I_{3}]\\;+\\;E[\\mathrm{PVA}]}\\right\\}$  . Figure  1c shows the optimized struc- ture of FASnI 3 –PVA after the energy relaxation. The distance  of outmost two   $\\mathrm{SnI}_{6}{}^{4-}$   layers enlarges 0.21 Å   $(\\mathrm{FASnI_{3}\\ 6.69\\ \\mathring{A}_{\\ast}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FAsnI_{3}-P V A\\ 6.90\\mathring{A}})$   due to the interaction between   ${\\mathrm{FAsnI}}_{3}$  and PVA, resulting in increased rotational freedom of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  (Figure S3, Supporting Information). This indicates that the  pendant hydroxy groups in the PVA molecule interact strongly  with the iodide ions through the hydrogen bonding interaction.  As we will discuss later, the strong   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   hydrogen bonds  significantly affect the crystallization kinetics of the   ${\\mathrm{FAsnI}}_{3}$  per ovsk ites and reduce the trap states.  \n\nFigure   2 a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   perovskite films with or without PVA additives. It was  observed that the similar characteristic XRD peaks were mainly  located at   $14.0^{\\circ}$  ,   $24.4^{\\circ}$  ,   $28.1^{\\circ}$  ,   $31.6^{\\circ}$  ,   $40.4^{\\circ}$  , and   $42.9^{\\circ}$   that were  assigned to (100), (102), (200), (122), (222), and (213) crystal  planes of the ortho rhombi c   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   perovskite phase, respectively. But the intensity of (100) and (200) peaks increased obviously after the addition of PVA, and the peak intensity ratio of  (100)/(102) increased from 0.95 to 3.5. To further assess the  orientation of the crystalline grains within the perovskite films,  we measured the X-ray rocking curve of the (200) plane. The  rocking curve is the most reliable measure of the average orientation of a particular crystallographic phase.  As shown in  Figure S4 in the Supporting Information, the rocking curve  of the pristine   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   film displays a broad full-width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of   $19.8^{\\circ}$  . After the addition of PVA, the  rocking curve is sharper with lower FWHM of  $17.4^{\\circ}$  . This lower  FWHM value indicates that the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   perovskite phase favors  the orientation of the (h00) direction when crystallizing in the  presence of PVA. We attributed the improved crystal orientation  of the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA film to the directional   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   hydrogen  bonding interactions between PVA and the   $\\mathrm{SnI}_{6}{}^{4-}$   lattice. This  interaction prevents the in-phase and out-of-phase rotations of  the nearby   $\\mathrm{SnI}_{6}{}^{4-}$   octahedral frameworks, which leads to an oriented crystal growth of the perovskite lattice.  This observation  indicated an apparent preferable growth along (h00) crystallographic planes of the FASnI 3 –PVA film, which is the most  favorable orientation\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
