Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The   $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$   ion (Figure 7b, left)  is located near the iodide ions. The neutral   $\\mathrm{H}^{0}$   atom (Figure 7b,  center) is located in an interstitial lead iodide site, and the   $\\mathrm{H^{-}}$  ion (Figure  7b, right) is close to the   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   cation. According to  the simulation results, the bond lengths for   $\\mathrm{I-H^{+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{I-H}^{0}$  , Pb–  $\\mathrm{H}^{0}$  , and   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{H}^{-}$   are 1.7, 2.0, 2.1, and   $\\mathrm{\\ddot{\\Omega}}_{1.9\\mathrm{~\\AA~}}$  , respectively.   $\\mathrm{H}^{0}$   is  bonded covalently with   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   and I atoms. In particular,   $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$   acts  as a bridge between two iodide atoms in the HMHP, and the  iodide undergoes rearrangement on a lattice site. The  $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$   cation  is close to MA, reducing the repulsive interactions of the defect,  and resulting in the rearrangement of iodide anions with the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation. Simultaneously, the  $\\mathrm{H^{-}}$   ion approaches the ammonium cations. These observations indicate rather weakly bound  X sites and that the rearrangement has little energy cost. Hence,  it is beneficial for charged defect stabilization. These hydrogen  migrations with ionization enhancement have been discussed  according to the Bourgoin–Corbett mechanism.  Moreover,  interstitial   $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$   can trap one or two thermal electrons on illumination, under the operating conditions, and get converted to  $\\mathrm{H}^{0}$  and   $\\mathrm{H^{-}}$  . The electron–hole pair is enhanced by ionization, and  migrates to different sites in the crystal lattice.  \n\nConsequently, the thermally activated diffusion of   $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$  , the  smallest migrating species in the HMHP, is discussed. In  Figure 7c (bottom), the migration of   $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$   between two bridged  equatorial iodide anions and an equatorial/apical iodide is  shown. This is similar to that in oxide perovskite proton conductors. As shown in Figure  7c (top), minimum energy path  calculations yield the energy barrier for lateral iodide-to-iodide  proton migration:  $0.29\\,\\mathrm{eV}.$   The energy barrier for  $\\mathrm{I-I\\;H^{+}}$   transfer  is less than   $0.17\\ \\mathrm{eV}.$   Therefore, lattice relaxation is prevented  during fast proton migration, but iodide rearrangements occur  when   $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$   is far from the two iodide ions. However, this study  of hydrogen migration does not consider quantum tunneling  effects. If tunneling occurs under real operating conditions in  devices, defect migration due to the hydrogen fragmentation  of A-site organic cations could significantly influence the instability of the HMHP material.  \n\nThe tunneling effect  in hydrogen dissociation and  migration processes leads to a significant fragmentation of  organic A-site cations in HMHPs. Investigations have shown  that quantum tunneling effects are very important for hydrogen  dissociation in prismatic water hexamers.  Water molecules  can accelerate hydrogen dissociation on organic molecules in  all types of HMHPs, reducing the material stability. Furthermore, there are many reports on the weakness of HMHP materials and devices in highly humid conditions. The entry of water  molecules can result in the rapid decomposition of HMHP  materials. Moreover, polar additives in organic hole conductors  also influence the disintegration of HMHP materials and the  loss of the long-term stability of devices. Marom et. al. reported  the dissociation of hydrogen atoms on the backbone of MA  molecules, due to a photo induced state.  \n\nHerein, we propose the decomposition mechanisms for represent at ive HMHPs such as   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  , based on the reaction and  dissociation processes (5) and (9) in Section 3.2  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}P b I_{3}\\rightarrow C H_{3}+N H_{2}+H^{(-,0,+)}+P b I_{3}\\rightarrow C H_{3}+N H_{2}+P b I_{2}+H I}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}P b I_{3}\\rightarrow C H_{3}+N H_{2}+H^{(-,0,+)}+P b I_{3}\\rightarrow C H_{3}+N H_{2}+H P b I+I_{2}}\n$$  \n\n(10)  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}P b I_{3}\\rightarrow C H_{2}+N H_{3}+H^{(-,0,+)}+P b I_{3}\\rightarrow C H_{2}+N H_{3}+P b I_{2}+H I}\n$$  \n\n(11)  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}P b I_{3}\\rightarrow C H_{2}+N H_{3}+H^{(-,0,+)}+P b I_{3}\\rightarrow C H_{2}+N H_{3}+H P b I+I_{2}}\n$$  \n\n(12)  \n\nIn fact, more complicated processes occur in HMHP materials under operating conditions. In such proposals, new  technical methods for controlling the hydrogen dissociation  process and reactions under operating or non operating conditions using new system designs need to be considered. Undeniably, MA should be avoided for real-world devices to achieve  better stability. However, the use of organic A-site cations such  as   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{U}^{+}$   is unavoidable for the development of HMHP  materials.  \n\n# 4. Summary and Future Outlook  \n\nHMHP materials are physically and chemically unstable in the  presence of heat, humidity, light, and internal/external biases,  related to the crystal structures and molecular/atomic st abilities  under various conditions. In this review, we have discussed the  crystal structures based on A-site species like   $C s^{+}$  ,  $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  in the   $\\mathrm{APbI}_{3}$   system. The representative   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   system has  three phases—ortho rhombi c, tetragonal, and cubic—at temperatures ranging from 20 to   $350\\ \\mathrm{K}.$   These crystal-phase transitions are significantly associated with the motion of organic  cations, representing fully ordered, partially ordered, and fully  disordered phases, respectively. For   $C s^{+}$  and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   cations and  their substitutions in HMHPs, two different crystalline phases  are formed: the   $\\delta$  and   $\\alpha$  phases. The   $\\delta$  crystal phase is thermodynamically stable, unlike the   $\\alpha$  crystal phase. However, the   $\\delta$  crystal phase can transform into the   $\\alpha$  phase under an applied  thermal bias, enabling the reversible transformation from the   $\\alpha$  to   $\\delta$  phase. Thus, these unstable crystal phases negatively affect  device stability under normal conditions.  \n\nAmong the three HMHP materials, the   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   system  has been frequently applied as a light absorber in solar cell  devices. The substitution of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   cations in the   $\\mathrm{APbI}_{3}$   system  leads to quasicubic/fully cubic phases with motion, in the  inorganic cage. The phase stability is higher than that of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   system because of the lower rotational barrier and  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/245f068418d937fd8b91dd04f4b0dbbd6b10a669a53662060a594595512d7cf0-1727122427.jpg)  \nFigure 7.  $\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
