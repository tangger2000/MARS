Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The  work function  $\\phi$  of the pristine  $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$   increases from 4.63 to  $5.07\\,\\mathrm{eV}$   upon treatment with the  $\\mathsf{p}$  -type molecular dopant. The VBM of the doped  $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$   (5.36  eV) went deeper than pristine   $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$   (5.21 eV) as referred to vacuum level. The energy level offset between the VBM of   ${\\mathsf{N i O}}_{x}$   and perovskite decreased  from 0.18 eV for pristine  $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$   to  $0.04\\,{\\sf e V}$   for  $\\mathsf{p}$  -doped  $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x},$   indicating more efficient charge transfer at the molecular p-doped   ${\\mathsf{N i O}}_{x^{\\dot{\\imath}}}$  –perovskite interface.  \n\nthe middle of the band gap, respectively.  It is clearly shown  that the energy level offset ( Δ E ) for charge transfer between the  VBMs of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   and perovskite is reduced from initial   $0.18\\ \\mathrm{eV}$    to as low as   $0.04\\,\\mathrm{\\eV,}$   which is of paramount interest to the  enhancement of the devices’ open-circuit voltage and other performance owing to suppressing thermionic losses.  Owing  to the simultaneous reduction of its work function, the band  bending of  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  –perovskite interface was enlarged from 0.03 to   $0.47~\\mathrm{eV}.$  . As the band bending becomes deeper, F6TCNNQ dominated interface has lower holes concentration in the superficial  space charge region of  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  , resulting in more efficient charge  transport from per ovsk ites (Figure 1f).  \n\nMoreover, the conduct iv i ties of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   before and after molecular doping have been measured by   $I{-}V$  scan. The   $I{-}V$   profiles  of the pristine and F6TCNNQ-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   thin films on   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$    substrates with Au inter digit a ted electrodes showed significant  enhancement in conductivity after doping (Figure S3, Supporting Information). That is attributed to both ionization of  F6TCNNQ and hole concentration increase in the bulk of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$    after charge transfer between them, as well as the benefit from  efficient sweeping of carriers owing to that   $\\pi$  stacking in the  F6TCNNQ.  Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used  previously to discover the relationship between conductivity  enhancement and morphology evolution in F4TCNQ-doped  qu ater thi oph ene.  Here, conductive AFM (c-AFM) was directly  applied to investigate their microscopic conductivity variation  before and after doping (Figure S4, Supporting Information).  The results indicate that (1) the conductivity enhancement is  remarkable with at least 1 order of magnification and (2) the  ionization of F6TCNNQ is uniform across the whole surface.  This further convinces us that the modification of F6TCNNQ  on   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   is uniform, robust, and reproducible, which affords  huge potential in its application in hybrid electronics.  \n\nAlthough all the above evidences support convincingly the  electron transfer from   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs to F6TCNNQ that contributes to the device performance enhancement tested above, they  are not direct. Therefore, to further confirm our results, theoretical calculations were performed with first-principle simulations to investigate the doping mechanism in the molecular  p-doping of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  . The frontier orbital energy levels of the  F6TCNNQ molecule were calculated by Gaussian 09 1A under  the level of B3LYP/6-311g\\* (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The LUMO and highest occupied molecular orbital  (HOMO) of F6TCNNQ are calculated at   $-5.56$   and   $-7.44~\\mathrm{eV},$  ,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/bde84b904e3b72de4857f59b164fb6385983ee1d33f1ce54b5b5e4f5713741b7-1727117631.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   a,b) The relaxed model of an F6TCNNQ absorbed on an  $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$   100 surface. The two surfaces are terminated with O element. Three Ni-O  layers are used to mimic the surface. The vacuum between the molecule and the upper surface is larger than   $\\mathsf{I0\\AA}$   to avoid layer–layer interaction.  c) Electron density difference of an F6TCNNQ on   $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$   layer. Yellow means gaining electron and cyan means electron deficit.  \n\nrespectively, which agree with experiments and theory reported  by Karpov et al.  These deep LUMO and HOMO suggest the  high electron affinity (EA) energy, which measures the ability of  electron attracting. As expected, the adiabatic EA was calculated  to be   $-4.28~\\mathrm{eV},$  , which is higher than the highest element EA  (fluorine,   $-3.4~\\mathrm{eV}$  ). The high EA suggests that F6TCNNQ can  harvest electrons from the host and p-type dope host. A successful molecule doping of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   also requires that the molecule  could be adsorbed and hold steady on   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  surface. To clarify  the doping and charge transfer processes, we built a model of  an F6TCNNQ molecule on an O-terminated   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}\\;100\\$   surface,  as shown in  Figure   2 a.
