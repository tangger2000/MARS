Incident  photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on a  computer-controlled IPCE system (Newport) containing a Xenon lamp,  a monochromator, and a Keithley multimeter. The system was calibrated  with the certified silicon solar cell and the IPCE data were collected at DC  mode. The TPD-MS measurements were carried out in an in situ pyrolysis  TPD-MS apparatus.

Each spectrum is an accumulation  of 1000 spectra gathered at interval of   $100\\,\\upmu s$  . The typical pressure of the  pyrolytic furnace was kept at   $2\\times10^{-4}$   Pa to prevent secondary reactions.

The surface morph o logie s  were recorded on an SEM-4800 field-emission SEM. The IR spectra were  measured on an FTIR spectroscope (IR200, Thermo Nicolet, USA). The  EIS measurements were carried out on a CHI 760E electrochemical  workstation  (Chenhua  Instrument  Company,  Shanghai,  China).

J â€“ V  characteristics were recorded in the dark by  a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit. The electron mobilities were  extracted by fitting the  $J^{-V}$   curves according to the reported method.
