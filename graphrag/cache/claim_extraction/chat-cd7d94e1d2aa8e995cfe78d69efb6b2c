Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.

For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type.

TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Upon increasing the ratios  GAI:FAI, the size of the perovskite crystal increases continuously, but no phase transition was observed (Figure  1a). The  device performance became optimal at GAI   $20\\%$   and   $\\mathrm{EDAA}_{2}\\,1\\%$    (E1G20), for which a fresh cell showed the best PCE   $8.5\\%$   and  certified efficiency  $8.3\\%$  . The device performance was certified  under a strict condition to prove the superior stability of our  devices. Moreover, when the device was stored in a glove box,  the performance increased continuously, to attain PCE   $9.6\\%$    after storage period   ${\\approx}2000\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~h~}}$  ; the great performance and stability of the device have attained a new milestone for lead-free  perovskite solar cells on a path toward commercialization.  \n\nOur preceding work  indicated that adding   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$     $1\\%$   in a  trace proportion would assist the growth of uniform and dense  perovskite films free of pinholes;   $\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3}{-}1\\%\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   (E1) PSC  was hence chosen as a standard cell for comparison with other  devices made of mixed GAI/FAI in varied ratios. The scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) top-view images of both  $\\mathrm{G}x$   and   $\\mathrm{E1G}x$   \n\n  $(x=0–30)$   films appear in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). \n\n  $\\mathsf{G}x$   films evidently have a pinhole problem, which has been  solved on adding   $\\mathrm{{Al}_{2}\\ 1\\%\\ (\\mathrm{{E1G}}}$   to control the morphology of  the perovskite films. The problem of pinholes of the G20 films  cannot be fixed in the absence of   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   due to the unbalanced  rates between nucleation and crystal growth,  i.e., when the  crystal growth rate was too rapid and the nucleation was not complete yet, then rapid growth of the crystal would generate pinholes  on the G20 films. In contrast, the existence of a small amount of   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   in the E y G20 films could slow down the crystal growth so  that the uniform nucleation can be achieved to form dense-packed  and pinhole-free perovskite films. This phenomenon is the same  as what we observed for the E1 films in comparison with the pristine   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   films,  and we may conclude that   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   can control the growth rate of perovskite for the case of E y G20 as well.  \n\nThe Goldschmidt tolerance factors   $(t)^{[28,29]}$   listed in Table S1  (Supporting Information) indicate that the formation of mixedcation   $\\mathrm{GeV^{+}/F A^{+}}$   tin triiodide per ovsk ites is feasible. Large-scale  single crystals for three compositions (  $\\mathrm{E1G}x_{\\mathrm{i}}$  ,   $x=10$  , 20, and 30)  were grown in   $\\gamma$  bu tyrol act one (GBL) for a period of 45–60 days,  according to photographs shown in Figure S2 (Supporting  Information); Table S2 (Supporting Information) lists the lattice parameters of these single crystals. Single-crystalline and  thin-film samples of our mixed-cation tin perovskite appear  black and have great stability in air. Kubicki et  al.  found  that black hybrid   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}/G A^{+}}$   lead triiodide perovskite crystals  were thermodynamic ally unstable and became yellow in a few  hours; moreover, crystal re orientation was observed in their  mother structure   $(\\mathrm{Frob}_{3})$  .  Phase transition occurred  at room temperature has been reported for   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   but not  for   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   because it happened at much lower temperatures   $(125{-}150\\,\\mathrm{\\K})^{[32]}$   for which the black phase of   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   is stable  at room temperature.  Based on our single-crystal results, the   $\\mathrm{FA}_{x}\\mathrm{FA}_{1-x}\\mathrm{snI}_{3}$   per ovsk ites adopt the same structure as   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$    until adding   $30\\%$   of   $\\mathrm{GABA}^{+}$  . We therefore expect that they have  the same phase stability as their parent perovskite   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  .  \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) data for a single crystal confirm  that   $\\mathrm{GABA}^{+}$  cations inserted into a 3D perovskite lattice structure according to the E1G20 supercell shown in Figure  1b.  The   $\\mathrm{FA}_{x}\\mathrm{FA}_{1-x}\\mathrm{SnI}_{3}$   per ovsk ites adopt the same structure as   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   with an ortho rhombi c unit cell, space group  Amm 2.   On introducing   $\\mathrm{GABA}^{+}$  into the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   structure, because   $\\mathrm{GA^{+}}$    cation is larger than   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  , the unit cell expands and the lattice parameters gradually increase. This feature of the crystal  structure has been observed in a hybrid   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}/G A^{+}}$   lead-based  perovskite  $\\mathrm{MA}_{1-x}\\mathrm{GA}_{x}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$ . Powder XRD spectra of  $_{\\textrm G x}$ thin-film samples confirm this change in crystal lattice, for which  the diffraction signals shifted systematically to small angles  upon increasing the proportions of GAI (Figure S3, Supporting  Information) until a large proportion of GAI (G30); no other  phase or precursor signal was observed. Figure 1a shows that  the same behavior was observed for the thin-film samples with  additive   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   $\\mathrm{I}_{2}\\ 1\\%\\ (\\mathrm{E1G}$  . The presence of   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   can alter  the preferred orientation of crystal growth along the direction  of plane (100)/(110). In contrast, in the absence of   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$  , the  growth of the crystal along the direction of plane (120) was preferred (Figure S3, Supporting Information). As mentioned elsewhere,    $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   additive plays a key role to control the kinetics  of film formation and produce the crystal grain size more uniform than the pristine   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   and therefore affects the crystal  orientation of perovskite on the film.  The XRD patterns of  the   $\\mathrm{E}1G x$  films with varied GAI proportions   $\\begin{array}{r}{(x=0–30)}\\end{array}$  ) were  simulated (TOPAS software) to calculate the lattice parameters  of the perovskite crystals at varied GAI proportions (Figure S4,  Supporting Information); the simulated lattice parameters are  listed in Table S3 (Supporting Information). The crystal lattices  of the thin-film samples show the same feature as the singlecrystal data with lattice parameters gradually increasing on  increasing the proportion of GAI.  \n\nX-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of   $\\mathrm{E}1G x$  samples  (as shown in Figure  1c) were de convoluted into two components corresponding to   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   (red trace) and   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   species  (green trace). The calculated fractions of those   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$    species are shown in Table S4 (Supporting Information). These  data indicate that the presence of   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   in a trace proportion  stabilizes the tin perovsk\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
