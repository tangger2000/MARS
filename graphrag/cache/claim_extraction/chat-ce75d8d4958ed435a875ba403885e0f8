The text discusses the crystal phases and microstructures of $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$ films, but does not provide any claims about PSCs themselves.<|>-PSCs. The crystal phases and microstructures of pristine and w/3AAH   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   films are studied in  Figure S1 (Supporting Information). It is observed that incorporating 3AAH into  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   does not cause the obvious peak shift  nor change the crystal phase. The micro structure of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   is  characterized by high-resolution transmission electronic microscope (HRTEM). From the results in Figure  S1c (Supporting  Information), the pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   shows a mixture of (110) and  (101) crystal planes corresponding to 3.38 and   $2.67\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   lattice  spacing, respectively, while,   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  presents a high phasepurity with only (110) crystal plane being observed. Atomic  force microscopy (AFM) of the samples is also compared in  Figure  S1e,f (Supporting Information). With 3AAH addition,  the corresponding root-mean-square (RMS) of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film is  decreased from 1.54 to   $1.25\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  . The high crystal lin it y, preferred  orientation, and low film roughness exhibited by the 3AAH $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   contribute to the improvement of the film quality of the  ETL, which would promote the electron transfer at ETL/PVK  interface.  The uniform distribution of C, N and I elements in  energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping of the pristine  and w/3AAH   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   shown in Figures  S2 and S3 (Supporting  Information) indicates that 3AAH is homogeneously doped in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  .

The highresolution XPS spectra of Sn and O are shown in Figure   $\\mathrm{1c-e}$  .  Compared with pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  , Sn 3d peak is shifted by   $0.08~\\mathrm{eV}$  toward higher binding energy with 3AAH addition. It indicates  the formation of coordination bonds between   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and the carbonyl group in 3AAH, which reduces the oxygen vacancy defects  in the  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL.   $(\\mathrm{O}^{2-}\\leftrightarrow1/2\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\uparrow+\\mathrm{V}_{0}+2\\mathrm{e}^{-}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}+2\\mathrm{e}^{-}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+})$  )  In addition, by comparing the O 1s spectra, it is found that  3AAH doping increases the content of saturated oxygen   $(\\mathrm{O}^{2-})$  while decreases the proportion of hydroxyl groups   $\\left(\\mathrm{OH^{-}}\\right)$  . This  is favorable for improving the electron transport characteristic  and suppressing the non radiative recombination losses. Based on the UV–vis absorption spectra and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information), valence band maximum (VBM) and  conduction band minimum (CBM) of the   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ETL  film are determined to be   $-8.48$   and  $-4.35~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively. Corresponding ly, the energy level diagrams of the PSCs are shown  in Figure  1f, which demonstrates well-matched energy levels  between ETL and PVK for efficient electron transport.  \n\nIn order to investigate the effect of 3AAH doping in   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$    on the subsequent film deposition, X-ray diffraction (XRD)  patterns are measured to evaluate the crystal lin it y of the PVK  film.  It is seen from Figure S6 (Supporting Information) that  the PVK film on the   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   layer shows much better crystallinity than that on the pristine   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   substrate, with increased  intensity from the (100) lattice plane and narrowed full width  at half maximum (FWHM). The morphology of PVK films  deposited on different ETL surfaces is then compared by scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements. As shown in  Figure   2 a,c, the size of the PVK grains on the surface of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    ETL with pre-buried 3AAH is larger and more uniform, and  the PVK grains exhibit a layered morphology of 2D PVK. This  is attributed to the coordination reaction of the amino group   $\\left(\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}\\right)$   in 3AAH with   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  , which passivates the lower surface  defects of the PVK films and induces the formation of 2D PVK  on the surface of ETL. It is beneficial for regulating the crystallographic orientation of PVK crystals. And according to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films, the Gibbs  free energy for heterogeneous nucleation can be expressed as   $\\Delta\\,G_{h e t e r o g e n e o u s}\\!=\\!\\Delta G_{h o m o g e n e o u s}\\!\\times\\!f(\\theta),$   wherein   $f(\\theta)\\!=\\!(2\\!-\\!3c o s\\theta\\!+\\!c o s^{3}\\theta)/4,$    and   $\\theta$  is the contact angle of the precursor solution. From  Figure  S12 (Supporting Information), compared to pristine   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2},$  ,   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   shows the smaller contact angle   $(18.0^{\\circ})$  .  The smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy  for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/ca297ba7a301b00475a8516c086f187bf743325bb43a23dce1b231627503d941-1727105426.jpg)  \nFigure   2.   SEM images of perovskite surface based on a) pristine   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and c) w/3AAH   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL.
