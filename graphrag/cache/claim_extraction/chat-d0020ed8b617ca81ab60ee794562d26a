For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The good inter facial contact may passivate defects  at HTM/perovskite interface and consequently reduce recombination loss and enhance device efficiency.  \n\nTo investigate the non radiative recombination losses in  PVSCs, the steady-state PL spectra were measured, as shown  in Figure S17 in the Supporting Information. The PL intensity was quenched sharply for the MPA-BTI/perovskite film  and even more significantly for the MPA-BTTI/perovskite film,  which indicates more efficient hole transfer at the interface  between MPA-BTTI and perovskite layer. The time-resolved  photo luminescence (TRPL) measurements were then carried  out as illustrated in Figure S18 in the Supporting Information  with the data of carrier lifetime summarized in Table S5 in the  Supporting Information. All of the PL decay curves exhibit biexponential lifetimes with an initial fast decay   $(\\tau_{1})$   and second  slow decay   $(\\tau_{2})$  . As elaborated in the literature,  such decay  may originate from either the extraction of charges at approximately (sub)nanosecond timescales or non radiative recombi- nation losses at approximately hundreds of nanosecond timescales. Following this principle, we can attribute the fast decay   $(\\tau_{1})$   to the charge extraction to the HTMs and/or partly to the  interface recombination, and the second slow decay   $(\\tau_{2})$   mainly  to interface recombination losses. Compared to a perovskite  film on ITO substrate (  $\\tau_{1}=12.4$   ns,   $\\tau_{2}=822.8$   ns), the perovskite on MPA-BTTI shows a sharply shortened   $\\tau_{1}$   of 3.3 ns and  a moderately decreased   $\\tau_{2}$   of 484.2 ns. However, the perovskite  on MPA-BTI exhibits a prolonged   $\\tau_{1}$   of   $46.5\\;\\mathrm{ns}$   and a drastically  reduced   $\\tau_{2}$   of   $171.8~\\mathrm{ns}$  , which suggests that hole extraction is  more efficient from perovskite to MPA-BTTI than from perovskite to MPA-BTI. At the same time, non radiative recombination  losses are significantly suppressed at the MPA-BTTI/perovskite  interface compared to the MPA-BTI/perovskite interface,  although the average lifetime   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}})$   of MPA-BTI seems to be  shorter than MPA-BTTI. Therefore, the enhanced hole extraction and reduced non radiative recombination of MPA-BTTI- based PVSC contributes to the higher   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and FF compared to  the MPA-BTI one.  \n\nOverall, our work indicates that for designing efficient  dopant-free HTMs for high-performance inverted PVSCs, in  addition to transmittance, energy level alignment, and hole  mobility, the molecular structure and the resulting film morphology play a critical role in determining perovskite film  growth on top and inter facial interactions. The smooth and  nonwetting HTM films can facilitate the formation of high  quality perovskite active layers. In addition, high HTM thermal  stability is beneficial for preserving the quality of the HTM/ perovskite interface and the growth of high quality perovskite  film. In the case of MPA-BTI, increased surface roughness can  be observed after annealing at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , which is lower than its   $T_{\\mathrm{g}}$     $(86~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   and also lower than the annealing temperature of  CsFAMA perovskite film   $(100\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  . Furthermore, the incorporation of pass iv ation groups into HTMs enables the inter facial  optimization and inhibition of charge carrier recombination,  leading to improved device efficiency.  \n\nIn addition to power conversion efficiency, long-term device  stability is essential for commercialization of PVSCs.

We first probed the  long-term stability in dark in a dry box with an   ${\\approx}20\\%$   relative  humidity (RH). As shown in Figure S19 in the Supporting  Information, the PEDOT:PSS-based device shows the poorest  stability with only   $50\\%$   of initial PCE retained after 15 days.  The inferior stability of devices with PEDOT:PSS can be attributed to its hygroscopic character. The PTAA- and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  -based  devices exhibit similar stability with  $80\\%$   and   $85\\%$   of their original PCEs retained after 40 days storage, respectively. Encouragingly, the best stability is achieved for the MPA-BTTI-based  device which maintains   $90\\%$   of initial PCE after 60 days. The  stability of encapsulated solar cell device under continuous  light irradiation in ambient environment   $({\\approx}25\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ,   $30–40\\%$   RH)  was then investigated. PEDOT:PSS-based device is not included  in the stability tests under illumination due to their clearly inferior stability in the storage test in dark. It was observed that  the MPA-BTTI-based device possesses much higher stability  than the PTAA based one under illumination (Figure S20, Supporting Information). We further measured the operational  stability of the MPA-BTTI-based device at the maximum power  point, which is shown in  Figure    5 a, demonstrating that   $90\\%$  of initial PCE could be maintained after   ${\\approx}500$   h continuous  illumination. Furthermore, thermal stability characterization  shows that the MPA-BTTI-based device can retain   $94\\%$   of its  initial PCE after thermal stress at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $800\\textrm{h}$   in glove box,  which is comparable with   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  -based device and much more  stable than PTAA based one (Figure 5b; Figure S21, Supporting  Information). The good long-term stability of the MPA-BTTIbased device could be attributed to the excellent morphological  properties of the underlying MPA-BTTI film, which yield  favorable inter facial interactions between HTM and perovskite,  enable compact perovskite growth, reduce grain boundaries  and surface defects, and inhibit various processes leading to  the performance degradation, such as water penetration, perovskite decomposition, ion migration, and other undesirable  changes.  \n\nIn  summary,  two  novel  donor–acceptor-type  SMHTMs with phenyl amine groups as the donor units and  imide-functional i zed thiophene derivatives as the acceptor units  were rationally developed based on the identified molecular  design principles. Both SM-HTMs show similar photo physical  and electrochemical properties but greatly different molecular  configuration and film morphological properties. While there  is a complex interplay between HTM properties and device  performance, it was found that the film morphology played  more important part in determining the device performance  compared to transmittance, energy level alignment, and hole  mobility. This is likely due to the significant effects of underlying HTM film properties on the crystallization of the perovskite film deposited on top, as well as the interface quality and  consequently inter facial recombination losses. Hence, due to  good energy level alignment, appropriate hole-transporting  ability, and most importantly, the excellent film morphology  (i.e., high thermal stability, smooth\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
