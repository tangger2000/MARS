Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

For instance, the luminance of  wLED still reaches as high as 400 000 cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   at a high current  of   $300~\\mathrm{mA}$  , which ensures its practical application in LCD as  back-lighting source.  \n\nFor concept demonstration, we have assembled a backlighting source by embedding   $36\\mathrm{\\Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based wLEDs  on the two sides of light guiding plate (LGP) ( Figure   6 a–d).  The main function of LGP is to guide the spot white light from  wLEDs to the plane white light. Indeed, PL spectrum recorded  from LPG shows blue/green/red tri-color narrowband emissions (Figure 6e), and high-brightness and uniform plane white  light is clearly observable under the driving voltage/current of   $12\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   per 2A (Figure  6f). A demo display device was successfully designed by combining a commercial TFT-LCD panel  with the present   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based wLED arrays in the LGP  (Figure  6g; Figure S7, Supporting Information). As demonstrated in Figure 6h, an image with a logo of “Fujian Normal  University” and white background is converted via single-chip  micyoco and integrated circuit, and finally is displayed in the  screen. We detected radiance PL intensities of specifically  selected six positions in the LCD screen with the help of a luminance meter. Evidently, blue/green/red tri-color spectral profiles are similar (Figure S8, Supporting Information) and the  radiance intensities are almost the same for all these positions  (Figure 6i), confirming color and brightness uniformity of the  display device. Furthermore, we directly recorded the brightness value every other day for 9 days and took photos of the  display. No obvious variation in radiance and image is found  (Figure S9, Supporting Information), evidencing excellent stability for the prototype display device.  \n\nFinally, we compare the present prototype LCD device  with a commercial LCD (ZT0007, Shenzhen Kaiyixing Electronics Co., LTD) to confirm its wide-color-gamut feature.  The backlight source of commercial LCD consists of blue  LED chips and YAG: Ce phosphors, which produces a combined white light originated from blue emission of LED  and a broadband yellow emission of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$  : 4f–4f transition  (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The images of two  kinds of LCD devices based on the commercial backlit unit  and the present   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{X}}_{3}@$  glass backlit unit are presented in  Figure    $\\mathrm{7a-d}$  . Compared to traditional YAG:Ce-wLED backlight, the displays adopting   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}@$  glass-wLED backlight  exhibit more details of object colors. For instance, for the  display of green color image, the commercial one yields a  yellowish green color (Figure  7a), while the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glassbased one presents a pure green color and a more remarkable  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/cd295b32e23f7871907614ee2207668c2170f3e2d20723703c0d76e5c72c19ed-1727105232.jpg)  \nFigure   6.   Photographs of a,b)   $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\emptyset$  glass-based wLED array and c,d) LGP coupled with two wLED arrays. e) PL spectrum and f) luminescent  photo­ graph of LGP under a operating voltage of 12 V. g) Schematic structure of the  $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\emptyset$  glass-based back-lighting LCD system. h) Photograph of  the designed   $\\mathsf{C s P b X3@}$  glass backlit LCD in operation and i) radiance PL intensities from six different detecting positions in LCD screen.  \n\ncolor rendition (Figure  7c). Similarly, display image with  a pure red color and a high saturation is easily realized  for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based LCD (Figure  7d). We directly  measured radiance PL spectra for the pure white, blue,  and green images in the two LCD screens via a luminance  meter. The recorded spectra have been filtered by the color  filters (Figure S11, Supporting Information) and blue/green/ red images show concomitant weak PL bands of other colors  besides dominant emissive profiles (Figure  7e). Evidently,  the fwhm values for both green and red emissions (  $(26~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  ,   $33~\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ) from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based LCD are far narrower than those (  $69\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ,   $54~\\mathrm{nm}$  ) from the commercial one  (Figure  7e). As a consequence, according to the calculated  CIE color coordinates (Table S7, Supporting Information), the  color gamut of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based LCD reaches as high  as   $127\\%$   of NTSC standard and   $176\\%$   of that of the commercial one (Figure 7f).  \n\n# 3.
