We choose TBOT as the titanium precursor  because it has high reactivity and can hydrolyze at low moisture  level when exposed to air.  The titanium precursor was added  dropwise into a toluene solution of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs during stirring in a glove bag with  $30\\%$   humidity at ambient temperature.  Then the solution was stirred for   $3\\mathrm{~h~}$   and the hydrolysis reaction occurred leading to the formation of   $\\mathrm{Ti(OH)}_{x}\\mathrm{(OC_{4}H_{9})}_{4-x},$    which enable the titanium matrix   $(\\mathrm{TiO}_{x})$   to gradually deposit on  the surface of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}\\,\\mathrm{NCs}$   (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting  Information). The absorption of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs drops to   ${\\approx}90\\%$   of the original value in 3 h (Figure S2a, Supporting  Information), which might indicate partial decomposition of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs or the partial dissolving of NC corners and edges  during the hydrolysis and calcination process as discussed  below. After hydrolysis of the titanium precursor, a gray shadow  area was observed surrounding the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs in TEM  (Figure S3a, Supporting Information), suggesting   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    NCs have been encapsulated into   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   matrix. Subsequently,  a calc in a ting process was applied to remove excess water (by  dehydration) and organic matter to form nearly mono disperse \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs with   $5\\,\\pm\\,3$   nm thick   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell \n\n (Figure 1c, Figure S3b, Supporting Information). TEM analysis  indicates one   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NC core per   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell  NC in the majority of the core/shell NCs. However, multiple  perovskite NCs   $({\\mathrm{1-4~Cs}}{\\mathrm{PbBr}}_{3}{\\mathrm{~NCs}})$  ) within a core/shell NC were  also observed (Figure S3b, Supporting Information), which  indicates the hydrolysis of TBOT may be nonuniform and can  encapsulate more than one   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs during the hydrolysis  and calcination process. It should be noted that the size of NCs  in the composite were almost unchanged but a rounding of the  corners and edges was observed (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). The resulting changes might be due to a trace amount  of water on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   surface produced during the calcination, which could react with the corners and edges as they are  the most active sites of the nanocubes,  therefore, partially  dissolving the corners and edges during calcination.  \n\nTo better understand the role of hydrolysis and calcination  processes for the formation of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs, we  studied the structure, thermal, and surface properties of the  samples by thermo grav i metic analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). TGA analysis shows  that the weight loss of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x},$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$    samples proceeded in stages with temperature under argon  flow ( Figure   2 a). There is only about   $5\\%$   weight loss for  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    NCs between 30 and   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , which is attributed to the removal  of the surface organic ligands,  followed by fast weight loss  above   $500\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   due to sample decomposition. For   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   composite, about   ${\\approx}9\\%$   weight loss occurred from 30 to   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , which corresponds to the evaporation of the water.   An additional   $7\\%$   weight loss between 150 and  $250~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is due to  de hydroxyl ation and thermal decomposition of the remaining  organic compounds.  The  ${\\approx}9\\%$   weight loss in the temperature  range of   $250–300\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is related to the reduction of carbonaceous  residues in the structure.  No significant weight loss occurs  between 300 and   $500\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , which is associated with the amorphous precursor being converted to incomplete anatase phase  as the temperature increases under argon gas condition.   These observations were confirmed by XRD results (discussion below), as shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information).  Compared with the decomposition temperature   $({\\approx}500\\ {\\mathrm{}}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   of  simple   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs, a slightly higher decomposition temperature   $({\\approx}550\\ {\\mathrm{}}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs can be observed  indicating a slight improvement of thermal stability of the  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$    passivated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs. For   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   samples, the product of the  TBOT hydrolysis without the presence of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs, a similar trend was observed compared to that of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$   composite except no significant weight loss occurred above   $550~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    (up to   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , which is the highest available temperature in our  TGA measurements).  \n\nThe titania-coating process for the formation of core/ shell-structured   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  NCs was further studied by  FTIR spectroscopy of the titanium precursor,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$  composite, and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs as shown in  Figure 2b and Figure S5 (Supporting Information). Before the  formation of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  , FTIR spectra of the titanium matrix   $(\\mathrm{TiO}_{x})$    and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$  composite obtained at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   show   $\\mathrm{Ti-O-C}$    vibration in the   $1125{-}1035~\\mathrm{\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
