Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The higher conductivity results from the reduced trap density and removed OI ligands, as evidenced by the high PLQY of  $92\\%$   and  $66\\%$   reduced integrated intensity from the 1H NMR spectra (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). 24 ]  \n\nWe built hole-only and electron-only devices to study electrical transport mobility and density of trap states of control and treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms using the space charge limited current method. Current density–voltage   $(J^{-V})$   curves of hole-only and electron-only devices clearly exhibit three modes: Ohmic contact, trap-ﬁlling limit (TFL) and child region ( Figure  3 a,b ). We calculated the trap density by using the following equation [ 32 ]  \n\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{trap}}=\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}\\varepsilon_{0}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}{e L^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere  $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and  $\\epsilon_{0}$   are the relative dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity respectively,  e  is the elementary charge and    $L$   is the thickness of the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlm. Exploiting the linear dependence between the trap-ﬁlled voltage (  $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$   and the trap density   $(n_{\\mathrm{trap}})$  , we estimated the hole trap density was reduced from  $1.5\\times10^{17}$    to   $1.0\\times10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  , and the electron trap density was reduced from  $1.2\\times10^{17}$    to   $8.4\\times10^{16}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$    after pass iv ation. 33 ]  \n\nWe investigated the bandgap stability of control and treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms by monitoring their emission peak changes with time under heating conditions (Figure  3d,e ). 34–36 ]   The control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms experienced a blue shift within   $^{1\\mathrm{~h~}}$  of initial heating, ultimately shifting to   $622\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   after    ${\\approx}35\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$  (Figure  3f,h ). By contrast, the emission characteristics of treated\n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms remained stable with no obvious peak change within   $35\\mathrm{~h~}$   (Figure  3g,i ). Additionally, the electroluminescence (EL) peak of the treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$  LEDs is situated at  $636\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  , indicating a pure red emission (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information). The CIE coordinates for these LEDs are (0.698, 0.301), which coincides with Rec.2100 standards for pure red emissions (0.698, 0.301) (Figure  3c ).  \n\nEncouraged by the combined high mobility, high PLQY, and good thermal stability, we employed treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms as emitters to fabricate pure-red LEDs, using control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms as the control LEDs. We used a device con gu ration of indium tin oxide/poly(3,4- ethylene di oxy thi oph ene) poly(styrene s ulf on ate)/poly[ N , N ″ - bis(4-but yl phenyl)-  $N{,}N^{\\prime\\prime}$  -bis(phenyl)-benzidine]/ nano crystals/ (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(benzene-3,1-diyl)tris(diphenyl ph os phine oxide)/lithium 8-quinolate/Al ( Figure  4 a ). The crosssectional image of each layer structure in the device, as well as the energy levels of each layer calculated by the photoelectron spectrometer, is depicted in Figure  4a,b , respectively. 37 ]  \n\nThe LEDs showed bright, pure-red emission (EL peak of  $636\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   with FWHM of   $33\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  ) with similar current–voltage charact eris tics, though POT2T-based devices show enhanced maximum luminance. The broadened FWHM of EL related to the PL is caused by the Stark eﬀect, which explains that the band bending of material occurs under electrical excitation (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). 38 ]   The pure-red LEDs based on treated\n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nano crystals exhibit a maximum luminance of\n\n  ${\\approx}1621$   cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  , which is three times higher than the control LEDs (Figure  4c,d ). The EL spectra of the pure-red LEDs exhibit a symmetrical EL peak at   $636\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  ; and the spectra maintain constant when the current density up to   $40\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The turn-on voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{on}})$   of the treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   LEDs is    ${\\approx}1.8\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , while the control showed high   $2.2\\:\\mathrm{V}$   higher turn-on voltage. This voltage represents the lowest turn-on voltage observed among purered emission perovskite LEDs, exceeding even the bandgap by  ${\\approx}0.15\\,\\mathrm{V}.^{[39,40]}$    The treated pure-red LEDs exhibit a champion EQE of   $21.2\\%$  , which is twofold higher than the controls, and represents one of the highest among reported pure-red perovskite LEDs (Figure  4e ). We evaluated the    $T_{50}$   of the pure-red LEDs by monitoring the luminance decay at an initial luminance of 130 cd  $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The    $T_{50}$   of bi-ligand treated perovskite LED is   $240~\\mathrm{min}$  : this is eightfold higher than the control, and represents fourfold related to the best previous pure-red perovskite LEDs with EQE  ${>}20\\%$   (Figure  4f  and Figure  S12 , Supporting Information). Additionally, we recorded the EL peak at diﬀerent current density, and found that the emission peaks of the control LEDs exhibited a red shift, which is indicative of phase separation in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$  . By contrast, the EL peak of treated LEDs remained stable, demonstrating the e ect ive ness of the bi-ligand strategy in preventing the phase separation (Figure  $^{4\\mathrm{g,h,}}$  ). We also obtained the electroluminescence spectra of   $\\mathrm{L}_{90}$  ,   $\\mathrm{L}_{70}$  , and  $\\mathrm{L}_{50}$   (Figure  S13a,b , Supporting Information). As time progressed, the emission peaks of the control LED exhibited a shift due to halogen ion segregation under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld.
