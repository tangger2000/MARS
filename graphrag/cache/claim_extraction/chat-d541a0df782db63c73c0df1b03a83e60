Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The YSZ substrate was subjected to isopropyl  alcohol cleaning and sonication before the growth of the thin film to  ensure surface cleaning. The thin film growth was carried out at   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  under oxygen partial pressure of 10 mTorr with a heating rate of   $10\\ ^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}\\ m i n^{-1}$  . After deposition, the thin films samples were cooled down  in 2 Torr   ${\\sf O}_{2}$   with a cooling rate of   $5~^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}\\ m i n^{-1}$  . For electrochemical test,  a Au pattern was deposited onto YSZ substrate by sputtering as the  current collector. PBSCF powders were synthesized using a Pechini  process using stoic hio metric amounts of  $\\mathsf{P r}(\\mathsf{N O}_{3})_{3}{\\cdot}6\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$  ,  ${\\sf S r}({\\sf N O}_{3})_{2},$  , and   $\\mathsf{C o}(\\mathsf{N O}_{3})_{2}{\\cdot}6\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$   from Alfa,   ${\\sf B a}({\\sf N O}_{3})_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{F e}(\\mathsf{N O}_{3})_{3}{\\cdot}9\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$   from Sigma  as precursors (with details in the Supporting Information). The PBSCF  NTs were prepared by electro spinning following the same procedure as  described in previous work.  \n\nElectrochemical Measurements : The OER performance of PBSCF  before and after thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction was  tested by a standard three-electrode system, with the PBSCF thin film  electrodes or the PBSCF powder/NT on carbon paper as the working  electrode, a  $\\mathsf{A g}/\\mathsf{A g C I}$   electrode as reference electrode, and a Pt wire as  the counter electrode (with details in the Supporting Information).  \n\nCharacterization of the Catalysts : Surface morphology of PBSCF thin  film was observed by SEM (SU-8010, Japan) and atomic force microscopy  (MFP-3D-S, USA). The surface chemistry was characterized by XPS using  Thermo Scientific instrument (ESCALAB 250Xi) with mono chromate d Al  K α  (15 kV) X-ray radiation equipped with charge neutralization. The C 1s  peak at   $284.6~\\mathsf{e V}$   was used as the internal reference peak for calibrating  binding energies. The wet t ability of the surface was characterized by  contact angle measurement (DSA25, Germany). The crystal structure of  PBSCF thin film and powder was probed by XRD using Bruker D8 Advance  (Germany) with mono chroma ti zed Cu Ka radiation. Surface electronic  structure of PBSCF thin film was probed by STM/S (VT-STM from  Sci ent a omicron GmbH, Germany) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV)   $(\\mathsf{I}\\,0^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{\\nabla}\\mathsf{m b a r})$  samples were annealed in the same UHV chamber at   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   in   $\\mathsf{I}0^{-6}$  mbar   ${\\sf O}_{2}$   for   $^{\\mathrm{~2~h~}}$   to remove the undesired contaminants on surface.  Electro chemically etched W tips were used to perform STM in constantcurrent mode with a tip bias voltage of  $_{2-3}\\lor$   and the feedback tunneling  current of   $50{\\mathrm{-}}400~{\\mathsf{p A}}$  . The structure and composition of the NT were  characterized by TEM equipped with EDX (TEM, FEI titan themis 200,  USA).  \n\nComputational Methods : First-principles calculation was carried  out using VASP (Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package).  The  exchange-correlation functional assumed used a generalized gradient  approximation parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof.   To account for the strong correlation of d electrons in Co and Fe,  the Hubbard U correction  was applied to two elements with a  specific value of   $4\\ \\ {\\mathsf{e V}}.^{[37]}$   More details about sample preparation,  characterization, and DFT calculation can be found in Supporting  Information Methods.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of  China (11605063 and 91745203), Guangzhou Science and Technology  Program General Projects (201707010146), the Fundamental Research  Funds for the Central Universities (2018MS40), State Key Laboratory of  Pulp and Paper Engineering (2018TS08), Guangdong Pearl River Talent  Program (2017 GC 010281), Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial  Research Team Program (2014 Z T 05 N 200).
