Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Impressively, the overall water splitting performance of NiFe  LD  $\\bullet_{\\mathrm{H}\\cdot\\mathrm{NS}@\\mathrm{DG}10}$   bi functional catalyst exhibits more superior  electrolytic rate than NiFe LDH-NS  $@$  graphene (NG and G)  catalysts ( Figure   4 a, inset). It is also noteworthy that higher  loading for NiFe LDH $\\cdot\\mathrm{NS}@\\mathrm{DG}10$     $(2\\,\\mathrm{\\mg\\cm^{-2}})$  ) results in a  better performance for overall water splitting performance  with a current density of   $20\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$   at   $1.5\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   (Figure 4a,  inset). It is remarkable that our catalyst is ranking the best  as compared to other non-noble metal bi functional catalysts for overall alkaline water splitting (Figure 4b).   Furthermore, to realize the real application in solar-water  electrolysis, we fabricated a solar power assisted water-splitting device (Figure 4c). The evolution of both oxygen and  hydrogen bubbles could be clearly observed by powering  with a   $1.5~\\mathrm{V}$   solar panel (Figure 4c, inset and Movie S1, Supporting Information). Such a solar power assisted water-splitting device can be potentially applied in distributed energy  storage technologies.  \n\nIn summary, we have assembled a bi functional (OER and  HER) NiFe LDH-NS  $@$  DG10 hybrid catalyst for water splitting by homogeneously stacking the exfoliated FeNi LDH  cation sheets onto the negatively charged defective graphene  (DG). This hybrid structure combines the high OER catalytic  activity of the exfoliated FeNi LDH as well as the remarkable  HER enhancement together with the charge conducting of  DG synergistic ally. The as-prepared NiFe LDH-N  $\\mathrm{S}@\\mathrm{D}\\mathrm{G}10$    hybrid exhibits advanced electro catalytic activity and stability  for OER in an alkaline solution. The over potential of catalytic  OER is among the lowest of non-noble metal catalysts (as low  as 0.21 V) and the Tafel slope is   $52~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1}$  , which is much  lower than that of the   $\\mathrm{{Tr}/{C}}$   catalyst   $(109{\\mathrm{~mV}}\\,{\\mathrm{dec}}^{-1})$  . In regard to  HER in the alkaline solution, the NiFe LDH-N  $\\Omega_{}^{}\\textrm{\\,---\\,}$   hybrid  has exhibited extraordinary HER performance with a low overpotential (  $115~\\mathrm{mV}$   at   $20~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ) and a small Tafel slope. The  remarkable OER and HER performance of the resultant sample  NiFe LDH-N  $\\mathrm{NS}@\\mathrm{DG}10$   can be ascribed to the defective sites on  DG, which provide more efficient anchor sites to directly and  strongly couple transition metal atoms (Ni and Fe) on 2D exfoliated NiFe LDH nanolayers, leading to significantly enhanced  density of electron transfer at specific domains. A solar power  assisted water-splitting device was used to demonstrate the  as-prepared NiFe LDH-NS@DG10 hybrid materials as bifunctional catalysts for both OER and HER. Significantly, the water  splitting is driven by a solar panel of only   $1.5\\mathrm{~V.}$   The discovery  of this bi functional NiFe LDH-NS  $@$  DG10 electro catalyst highlights a new strategy of tuning structure and functionality of  metal-carbon based catalyst at molecular scale, which would  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/be3496143333c26f5125dfb77a9da3ab31a9f098d45c7f2fd718a56c1a54ed1e-1727114733.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $@$  DG10 as OER and HER bi functional catalyst in  $\\mathsf{l}_{\\textsf{M}}\\mathsf{K O H}$   for overall water splitting  (both loaded into Ni foam at a loading of   $2\\ \\mathsf{m g}\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  ), with the inset showing comparison of different catalysts including (i) NiFe LDH-NS@DG10  with  $2\\ \\mathsf{m g}\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   loading; (ii) NiFe LDH-NS  $@D G]0$   with  $\\mathsf{I}\\ \\mathsf{m g}\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   loading; (iii) NiFe LD  $\\mathsf{o H}\\!\\!-\\!\\mathsf{N S}\\!\\!\\otimes\\!\\mathsf{N G}\\!\\!\\mid\\!0$   with  $2\\ \\mathsf{m g}\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   loading; (iv) NiFe LDH ${\\mathsf{N S Q}}$  G10 with   $2\\ \\mathsf{m g}\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   loading; (v) bare Ni foam electrode). b) Comparison of the required voltage at a current density of   $20\\ m\\mathsf{A}\\ c m^{-2}$   for the NiFe   $\\mathsf{L D H}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{N S Q O}\\!\\mid$  DG catalyst with other state-of-the-art noble metal free bi functional catalysts. c) Demonstration of a solar power assisted water-splitting  device with a voltage of  $1.5\\;\\forall.$  \n\nhold the promise for large-scale and real-world water splitting  electro l yz ers.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.J. and L.Z.Z. contributed equally to this work.
