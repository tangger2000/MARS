Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

The higher-lying CBM of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$     $(-4.21~\\mathrm{eV})$   offers a desirable energy level alignment with the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film. It also  provides a favorable matching of cascade energy band between  the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL and the perovskite layer, which  facilitates effective extraction of photo generated electrons from  the perovskite layer to ITO electrode. In addition, the cascadetype VBM formed at the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/Z n O/\\Omega}$  perovskite interface also  provides better hole-blocking property with improved electron  selectivity at the cathode.  Figure   3 a depicts the  $J{-}V$  character istics of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs with different ETLs and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in  Table   1 . The   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL-based solar cells outperformed those  based on sole   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , with a simultaneous increase in   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   FF,  and  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $1.23~\\mathrm{V},$  ,  $78.8\\%$  , and   $15.0\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, leading  to a much higher PCE of   $14.6\\%$  . To the best of our knowledge,  it is one of the highest PCE for all-inorganic halide PVSCs  reported to date (Table S1, Supporting Information). The optimized thicknesses for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   stack are   $30/10~\\mathrm{nm}$  . Further increasing thickness of  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   reduced device efficiency due  to the increase in electrical resistance of the thicker  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , which  could be supported by the increase in device series resistance  (Table S3, Figure S4, Supporting Information). The significant  PCE enhancement in the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL modified  devices can be mainly attributed to the enhancement in both   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and FF. The increase of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   by   $0.17\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   in the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/Z n O}.$  - based device compared with the control device was consistent  with the higher-lying CBM of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , which aligns energetically  with the perovskite CBM and thus maximizes the built-in  potential of the PVSC with small   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$  . The improvement in  FF can be attributed to a reduction in the leakage and recombination path, supported by the enhancement in device shunt  resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{p}})$   from 2547.9 to   $3789.4~\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   in the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}.$  - and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -modified devices, respectively. To further evaluate  the effect of energy level matching on the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement, we  also fabricated PVSCs based on single   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETL and their photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table S3 and Figure S4  (Supporting Information). Although the magnitude of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$    improvement in the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  -based reference cells is not as large  as those in the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -based devices, an obvious increase  in   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   was still observed when compared to the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -based  reference devices, whereas the corresponding   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF were  decreased in comparison to those of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based devices,  which can be attributed to the relatively poor conductivity and  large series resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$   of the devices. It is worth noting  that all the measured   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   in our study were well matched with  the photo current density calculated by integrating the external  quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum with an error below   $5\\%$    (Figure 3b).  \n\nAs shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), negligible  hysteresis with high reproducibility was achieved in the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/}$   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  -modified   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  PVSCs. The time dependence of the  power output of the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayer- and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -modified  PVSCs was further evaluated by tracking their efficiencies  under maximum power-point conditions (Figure 3c). Both  the   $\\mathrm{{snO}_{2}/Z n O}.$   and sole   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -modified PVSCs exhibited a  highly stable power output, which may rule out the issue of  efficiency variation caused by light soaking effects.  We also  monitored the long-term thermal stability of un encapsulated \n\n  $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -based   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs and organic–inorganic \n\n  $(\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3})_{1-x}(\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3})_{x}$   PVSCs based on a widely used perovskite composition by continually heating the cells at   $85\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    in glove box (Figure 3d). As expected, the organic–inorganic  hybrid PVSCs were subjected to significant PCE loss, whereas  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs had retained   $80\\%$   of their original PCE  after   $300\\:\\mathrm{{h}}$   of heating at  $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.$  . The PCE loss of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSC  is mainly originated from the drop of photo current (Figure S6d,  Supporting Information), which could be attributed to the photoinduced phase segregation observed in some mixed halide  perovskite.
