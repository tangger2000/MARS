materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As a contrast, the SEM  image of pristine   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   material exhibits the bulk morphology that may be ascribed to the higher reactant concentration of S by using the sulfur powder as reactant (Figure 1b; and  Figure S4b, Supporting Information). Moreover, the detailed  structural and phase information has been evaluated by the  X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). As shown in  Figure   2 a, all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to hexagonal   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   (JCPDS  44-1418) and Ni foam substrate (JCPDS 04-0850) and without  any additional diffraction peaks of other impurities, indicating  the high quality of as-obtained   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   3D electrode.

Furthermore, the corresponding elemental mapping results confirmed that the uniform spatial distribution of  Ni (blue), S (orange), N (yellow) elements in the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   sample, suggesting the successfully introduction of   $_\\mathrm{N}$  elements (Figure 2c).  \n\nThe further chemical states information of the   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$  sample was investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectro­ scopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 2d, the high-resolution XPS  spectrum of   $\\mathrm{Ni}~2\\mathrm{p}$   shows two main peaks located at 856 and   $874~\\mathrm{eV},$   which can be ascribed to   $\\mathrm{Ni}~2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$   and Ni   $\\mathrm{2\\mathfrak{p}_{1/2}}$  , respectively.  Meanwhile, the satellite peaks at 861.3 and   $880.1~\\mathrm{eV}$  can be assigned to shakeup type peaks of Ni, and a small peak  located at the binding energy of   $852.9\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{~\\mathrm{eV}}}$   can be attributed  to the   $\\mathrm{Ni}~2\\mathrm{p}$   signal originating from the Ni foam substrate.  Figure 2e shows that the core-level scan spectrum of   $\\textsl{S2p}$   can  be divided into two main characteristic peaks at 162.4 and   $163.6\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   which can be ascribed to the   $\\textsl{S2p}_{3/2}$   and   $\\mathrm{~S~}2\\mathsf{p}_{1/2}$  , respectively. Moreover, the high-resolution spectrum of N 1s in  Figure 2f shows a distinct peak located at the binding energy  of   $398.2~\\mathrm{eV}$   that can be assigned to the Ni-N feature bonds, further confirming that the N elements have been successfully  doped into the   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   product.

As shown in  Figure   3 a, the  oxidation peaks located around   $1.38~\\mathrm{V}$   (vs RHE) are assigned to   $\\mathrm{Ni^{II}}$   to   $\\mathrm{Ni^{III}}$  , which have been discovered in most of Ni-based  electro catalysts.
