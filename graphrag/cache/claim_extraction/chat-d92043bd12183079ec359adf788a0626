Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Carbon nanotube fibers/graphene  fibers have been demonstrated as good candidates as the outer  electrodes, however, their conduct iv i ties are less satisfying   $(\\approx\\!10^{3}\\:\\mathrm{~S~}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ), especially in meters-long. Moreover, neither  metal nor carbon-based electrodes are transparent. As transparent electrodes are always desired in op to electronics, developing transparent flexible highly conducting materials are  of great importance in wearable photodetector s. Attempts  like Ag nanowires/PDMS composite materials have shown  some potentials, with Ag network as the conducting phase  and polymer as the flexible matrix, future studies may further  improve the conduct iv i ties of the composite materials while  keeping the transparency through nano structure and microstructure design.  \n\nFor a wearable PD, other than flexibility, more stringent  requirements need to be met. To effectively operate a wearable  PD and acquire useful information, the integration of PDs with  other electronic devices in the system is indispensable. On the  one hand, as the current wearable power supplies cannot fulfill  the need of portable electronic systems, self-powered features  are highly desired for PDs. Strategies such as integration with  solar cells and construction of a   $\\mathrm{p-n}$   junction have been demonstrated successfully. On the other hand, the commercially  miniature data processing and transmitting chips typically  require a threshold current of  ${\\approx}1\\;\\mathrm{mA}$   at a low bias   $(<\\!5\\mathrm{~V})$  , while  the photo current of most PDs in literature are far behind. To  get a higher photo current, MSM structure and photo-FETs are  two main approaches to obtain a high photogain.  \n\nAs for the applications, wearable photodetector s can be  mainly categorized into three groups: monitoring, imaging,  and optical communications.  \n\nIn wearable monitoring systems, internal signals (human  body) and external signals (ambient environment) are the two  primary directions. For health monitoring, photodetector s are  generally integrated with LEDs with constant power densities to detect biological signals of human body, such as heart  rate, heart rate variability, and oxygenation, which are primary  indicators of the health condition of a person. Conformal contact with the skin or nails is generally required for the wearable devices to obtain a stable and reliable measurement. And  the environment light needs to be deducted for the accuracy  of results. Thus, ultra flexibility and a high signal-to-noise ratio  are particularly important for a wearable PD in this scenario.  For monitoring the real-time UV intensity in ambient environment, as UV-B is believed to be a major etiologic agent in most  skin cancers or diseases, a few reports have shown potential as  real-time wearable UV alerts through visible color changes or  intensity variations read on cell phones. However, for the readthrough-color, it is not reliable especially one wants to know  the exact UV intensity. For the read-through-numbers on smart  phones, the bulky and heavy data transmitter and processor are  not compatible with the thin, flexible and wearable UV PDs.  On the one hand, further improvement of the photo current of  UV PDs and self-powered characteristics will free the devices  from amplifiers and additional power sources. One the other  hand, with the advance of flexible electronic circuits, a fully  portable, flexible, and wearable UV monitoring system may be  envisioned.  \n\nFor wearable imaging systems, visible and NIR PDs are  particularly important. A few examples have demonstrated the  preliminary wearable imaging recognition system with the size  of   $10^{*}10$   pixels, or tried to explore new functions such as biomimetic visual memory system by integrating PDs with memristors. However, it is still hard to realize a more sophisticated  and accurate imaging recognition system due to the possible  signal interference and short circuits, especially under bending  or stretching. On the other hand, color display, as an indispensable component in display, has witnessed some progress in  wearable systems. That is direct color display, which directly  switches the generated electrical signals as color changes  and avoids additional electronic components mostly based on  electro chromic effect.  The electro chromic display is well  adapted to low-cost flexible substrates like paper.  Thus, it  not only simplifies the wearable system fabrication but also  becomes very suitable for special working environments like  gaseous mine, where electric output is highly limited for  safety. Despite of these developments, the wearable data display still suffers from monolithic image output, which requires  advances in compatible integrated circuits and flexible display  screens.  Further advances on the flexible control circuits,  device layouts, compatible and effective fabrication methods,  and encapsulation techniques may aid to improve the geometry accuracy of wearable imaging and realize full color flexible  display.  \n\nFor wearable optical communication, IR PDs play a dominant role in versatile applications, including remote control,  data communication, radar systems, and even to future wearable “Internet of Things.” As IR PDs typically have a threeterminal device structure, elaborated design is needed when  introducing the gate electrode in the flexible electronic systems. In other words, for flexible IR PDs, both the preparation methods and integration techniques with other electronic  devices become more complicated in contrast to the stacking  or planar two-terminal PDs. Further exploration of organic IR  sensitive materials and utilization of the interlaced textile structure in the fiber-shaped IR device may serve as a way to address  those challenges.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nS.C. and X.J.X. contributed equally to this work.
