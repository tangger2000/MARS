Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The fundamental band gap  is calculated to be   $3.25~\\mathrm{eV}$   from Cl 3p to   $\\mathrm{Ag\\5s}$   orbital which  is consistent with the absorption spectrum of pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   $(<\\!350\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  . After doping   $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$   ions in   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$  , the extra Sb  ground-state   $5s$   orbital locates above the original VBM hybridized with the   $\\mathrm{Cl}\\ 3\\mathrm{p}$   orbital, and the Sb excited-state 5p orbital  appears in a gap deep in the host CBM (FigureÂ 2b). Based on  the calculation, the additional excitation peak of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$  :  Sb at   ${\\approx}370\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   can be assigned to the   $5\\mathrm{s}^{2}{\\rightarrow}5\\mathrm{s}^{1}5\\mathrm{p}^{1}$   transition of \n\n  ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   dopants   $(2.94\\,\\mathrm{eV})$   and the calculated STE emission band is \n\n  $1.68~\\mathrm{eV}$   which is consistent with the experimental PL spectrum.  Due to the STE emission of   $[\\mathrm{degCl}_{6}]^{5-}$   octahedron is parity-forbidden, the PLQY of pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   is very low. Incorporation of   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   ions could break the inversion symmetry of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   lattice, thus enhancing the STE emission intensity.  The above calculation results demonstrate that the introduced   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   ions modulate the host electronic structure and relax the  parity-forbidden transition, both boosting the STE emission of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   DP.  \n\n# 2.2.   $\\mathsf{S b}^{3+}{\\cdot Y\\mathsf{b}}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g l n C l}_{6}$   DP  \n\nTo obtain the NIR emission,   $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$    DPs were synthesized. XRD patterns (Figure S9a, Supporting  Information) show that the   $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doped  $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   DPs  with   $0.06{\\cdot}2.78\\%$     $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   doping maintain cubic phase structure  without impurity phase.   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   and   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   dopants are both homogeneously distributed in   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   host lattice (Figure S10,  Supporting Information). The actual content of   $\\mathrm{{Sub}}^{3+}/\\mathrm{{Yb}}^{3+}$    ions was measured by ICP-MS (Table S1, Supporting Information). The results show that only a small amount of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   can  be doped in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   DPs even at a high feeding ratio of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   to   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$  .  \n\nDFT calculations were carried out to investigate the formation energy of   $\\mathrm{{Sub}^{3+}/Y b^{3+}}$   ions in   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   (Table S2, Sup- porting Information). The calculation results reveal that the  formation energies of interstitial doping   $\\mathrm{{S}b_{i}(Y b_{i})}$   and heterovalent substitution doping   $\\mathrm{{Sh}_{A g}(Y b_{A g})}$   are much higher than  the homovalent substitution doping of   $\\mathsf{S b}_{\\mathrm{In}}(\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}_{\\mathrm{In}})$   in the Cl-rich  experiment condition. Therefore, under the Cl-rich condition,   $\\mathrm{{Sub}^{3+}/Y b^{3+}}$   replacing   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$  site is more energetically favorable  than replacing the   $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}}$   site or inserting in the interstitial site.  In other words, the   $\\mathrm{{Sub}^{3+}/Y b^{3+}}$   ions doping at the   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$   ions site  could be more favorable as iso electronic doping, in comparison  with he t ero valent doping or entering interstitial sites. As a  result, the crystal structure of   $\\mathrm{{Sub}^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   is  shown in Figure   $\\mathsf{S9b}$   (Supporting Information).  \n\nThe emission spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  : Sb,   $\\mathrm{x\\%Yb}$     $(x=0â2.78)$  )  in the visible and NIR regions were measured under   $370\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  excitation ( Figure Â  3 a,b). As shown in FigureÂ 3c, the NIR emission intensity greatly increases accompanied by decrease of  STE emission intensity within   $0.77\\%$     $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   doping. Higher  doping concentration leads to a decrease in NIR efficiency,  which may be caused by a non radiative recombination center  from doping-induced defects.  The highest NIR emission  with the PLQY up to   $50\\%$   is obtained at   $0.67\\%$   Sb,   $0.77\\%$  Yb doping (Figure S11c,d, Supporting Information). The   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6};0.67\\%\\mathrm{Pb}$  ,  $0.77\\%\\mathrm{Yb}$   sample exhibits a huge improvement of NIR emission intensity by   ${\\approx}140$   times compared to   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   singly doped sample (FigureÂ  3d) and has a single exponential decay with a lifetime up to   $2.99~\\mathrm{ms}$   which arises from  Laporte forbidden   $^2\\mathrm{F}_{5/2}{\\rightarrow}^{2}\\mathrm{F}_{7/2}$   transitions of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   f-electrons  (Figure S11b, Supporting Information). These results suggest  that   $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$   doping not only improves STE emission of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g}{\\cdot}$   $\\mathrm{InCl}_{6}$   but also provides a sensitization effect for   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions.  \n\nTo deeply understand the energy transfer (ET) mechanism  from STEs to   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions in   $\\mathrm{Sb^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$  , the  absorption spectra of the undoped,   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   singly doped,   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/a66b38a2536d62c2d624a06709be207fcb10874d404baefd80fceba08f72027b-172\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
