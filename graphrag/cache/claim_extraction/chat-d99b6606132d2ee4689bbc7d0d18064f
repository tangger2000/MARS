{"result": "## COMPLETE", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The concentrations of   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  and TBAB-  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   dis- persions are optimized to enable efficient CBL of PVSCs. As  shown in Figure  S8b and Table  S2 (Supporting Information),  the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device achieves the highest PCE with  the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   concentration of   $0.3~\\mathrm{\\:m g\\:\\mL^{-1}}$  . As shown in  Figure S8c and Table S3 (Supporting Information), the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device also realizes the optimal performance with  the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   concentration of   $0.3\\;\\mathrm{mg}\\;\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$  .  \n\nFigure  5c displays the   $J{-}V$  curves at reverse scan of the  champion devices and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in  Table   1 . Owing to the large Schottky  barrier and poor interface contact at   $\\mathrm{PCBM}/\\mathrm{Ag}$   interface, the  control device without CBL displays a conventionally low PCE  of   $16.25\\%$   with   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.08\\mathrm{~V},$   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $22.25~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and FF of   $6774\\%$   Compared with the control device, the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    based device shows a relatively larger PCE of  .74% ascribing  to the improvement in  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$     $(22.89\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ) and FF   $(70.61\\%)$  .  Moreover, the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device exhibits further  increased performance with a larger   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.12~\\mathrm{V},$   a larger  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$    of   $23.42\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , and a higher FF of   $82.54\\%$  , thus achieving  a promising PCE of   $21.65\\%$  . Such significantly enhanced efficiency should be due to the higher electrical conductivity and  better-matched energy level alignment in TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based  device. Besides, it is also worth noting that the device adopting  TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL exhibits obviously higher PCE   $(21.65\\%)$    than that of the BCP-based device   $(19.94\\%)$   (Figure  S8d,  Supporting Information) in this work and other previously  reported inverted devices based on   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbI}_{3}/\\mathrm{PCBM}$   with different CBLs (Figure  5d; and Table  S4, Supporting Information), indicating the outstanding role of TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL.  Figure  S9 (Supporting Information) displays the   $J{-}V$  curves  at reverse scan (RS) and forward scan (FS) of the champion  devices, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters  are summarized in Table  1.

Compared with the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device,  the TBAB  $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device exhibits the lower HI, which  may be originated from the higher electrical conductivity and  better matched energy level alignment as well as the effective  inhibition of iodine ions migration from perovskite layer to  Ag cathode.  Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profile measurements are conducted to  investigate the elemental distribution throughout the devices,  and the highest intensity of characteristic ion counts is used  to determine the functional layers of the devices. As shown in  Figure   6 a, the control device possesses much accumulation of  iodine ions at the PCBM/Ag interface, which is attributed to  the strong interaction between the   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   electrode and the iodine  ions migrated from perovskite layer. After inserting   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    CBL, the accumulation of iodine ions at the PCBM/Ag interface is decreased in the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device (Figure  6b),  indicating the partial inhibition of iodine ions migration from  perovskite layer to   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   cathode by the  $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL. Compared  with the  $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device, the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device  exhibits further reduced accumulation of iodine ions at the  PCBM/Ag interface (Figure 6c), demonstrating that the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL can effectively inhibit the iodine ions migration  from perovskite layer to   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   cathode.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/8db8257b40c64fd692dc35dcc90e6a0aa483431e3daec755f76474b7c5b9c199-1727105775.jpg)  \nFigure   5.   a) Schematic illustration of inverted PVSCs architecture, b) energy level diagrams based on different CBLs, c)  $J-V$   of the champion devices,  d) PCE summary of the   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3\\prime}$  /PCBM based inverted devices with different CBLs (specific description shown in Table S4, Supporting Information),  e) EQE curves of the champion devices,  $\\mathsf{f})$   the stable output photo current density and PCE of the devices, g) the EIS data fitted by the insert equivalent  circuit of the devices,  $\\mathsf{h}$  ) the  $V_{\\mathrm{{oc}}}$   versus  $P_{\\mathrm{light}}$   of the devices\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
