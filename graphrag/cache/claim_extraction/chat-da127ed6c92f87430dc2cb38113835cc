The TSC could also assist the growth of  perovskite crystals, leading to improved grain size and reduced  grain boundaries thereby influencing the PL properties. The  time-resolved PL spectra in Figure 3d displays more trap-state  and carrier recombination information by a fitted bi-exponential decay model   $(\\gamma=A_{1}\\mathrm{exp}[-(x{-}x_{0})/\\tau_{1}]\\,+\\,A_{2}\\mathrm{exp}[-(x{-}x_{0})/\\tau_{2}])$  ,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/b87693ea29dbb10196ce1ceb0714ac29e6917f3e80cb228802d69443473531c3-1727101098.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   a) High-resolution XPS spectra   $(\\mathsf{S n}\\,3\\mathsf{d})$   of the surface of  $\\mathsf{C s S n l}_{3}$   films without and with TSC addition. b) Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM)  surface potentials of  ${\\mathsf{C s S n l}}_{3}$   films without and with TSC addition. c) Steady PL and d) time-resolved PL spectra of   ${\\mathsf{C s S n l}}_{3}$   films without and with TSC  addition. e,f) Hole-only devices for measurement of the trap-state density of   ${\\mathsf{C s S n l}}_{3}$   perovskite films without and with TSC addition.  \n\nand the fitted parameters are summarized in  Table    1 . The  relatively faster decay lifetime   $\\tau_{1}$   is derived from charge carrier defect states, while the relatively slower decay lifetime   $\\tau_{2}$  is ascribed to a bimolecular radiative recombination in the  perovskite crystal.  After incorporating the TSC passivator,  the proportion of the decay lifetime obviously decreases from   $62.3\\%$   (pristine) to   $27.0\\%$  .0% (TSC), and the lifetime constant  increases from 9.6 ns (pristine) to 39.1 ns (TSC), respectively,  which is indicative of the reduced trap-state density in   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$  perovskite.

Con sequentially, the obtained average lifetime considerably  increases from 28.0 ns for the pristine perovskite to 139.2 ns for  the TSC treated perovskite. In addition to the PL measurement,  the light-intensity-dependent current density-voltage (J-V) charact eri z ation in Figure S14, Supporting Information, also verifies  that the trap assisted recombination is suppressed through the  surface pass iv ation of the TSC molecule.  \n\nTo present quantitative evidence of the TSC pass iv ation effect,  we used the space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique for  the direct measurement of its trap-state density.  The hole-only  devices with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsSnI 3 /2,2 ′ ,7,7 ′ - tetrakis[N,N-di(4-meth oxy phe nl)amino]-9,9 ′ -spiro bif luo rene  (Spiro-OMeTAD)/Au were fabricated, and then the dark current  was measured under applied bias. Figure  3e,f shows the J-V  curves of the fabricated devices on a double logarithmic scale,  which comprises of the Ohmic region, the trap-filled limit (TFL)  region, and the Child region. In the TFL region, the trap-state  density   $N_{\\mathrm{t}}$   can be calculated by the following equation:  \n\n$$\nN_{t}\\,=\\,\\frac{2\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}V_{T F L}}{q L^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\varepsilon$   and   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   are the relative dielectric constant (typically 35  for per ovsk ites) and vacuum permittivity, respectively.   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is  the onset voltage of TFL region;   $q$   and   $L$   are elementary charge  and perovskite thin film thickness.  The   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   of pristine   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   thin films is 0.29  V, leading to a hole trap-state density of   $1.25\\times10^{16}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . When introducing the TSC, the   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is  reduced to   $0.17~\\mathrm{V},$   corresponding to a reduced trap-state density  of   $7.31\\times10^{15}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . This result directly confirms that the TSC  surface pass iv ation can effectively reduce the trap-state density  of perovskite films. Since the TSC passivator is absorbed on  the film surface and grain boundary, and coordinated with the  Sn ions at the perovskite crystal surface, the reduced trap-state  density can be mainly attributed to the pass iv ation of surface  Sn vacancies and under coordinated Sn ions.  \n\nSince the Lewis based TSC passivator can effectively  passivate surface deep level defects and reduce non radiative  recombination s, the application of vapor-phase fabricated TSCpassivated   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   film as the photovoltaic layer is expected to  obtain high-performance lead-free PSCs.
