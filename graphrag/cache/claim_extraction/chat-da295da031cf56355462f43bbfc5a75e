In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The maximum voltage  for the devices with   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   is   $0.98~\\mathrm{V},$   and the maximum current  density is  $23.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The corresponding steady-state output  PCE was   $22.74\\%$   (Figure   $4\\mathrm{c}$  ). The best-performing device was  sent to a PV calibration laboratory (Quality supervision and  Testing Center of Chemical and Physical Power Sources of  Information Industry, China) for certification. A certified efficiency of   $22.54\\%$   was demonstrated with a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of 1.16 V,   $J_{S C}$    of   $24.78\\mathrm{{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}}$  , and FF of   $78.23\\%$   (Figure S17, Supporting  Information), making it one of the best planar PSCs. A performance comparison with previous devices based on bilayer ETLs  can be found in Table S3 (Supporting Information).  \n\nThe stability of PSCs is one of the most important criteria for commercialization.  The device stability was tested  under a nitrogen environment   $(25\\ \\mathrm{~}^{o}\\mathrm{C})$   without encapsulation,  as shown in Figure  4d. After 80 days, the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -based  PSC still maintains   $97.5\\%$   of its initial PCE. Compared with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based PSCs which retain only   $92.7\\%$   of their initial PCE,  our results verify the enhanced stability of the new device.  Figure 4e shows the normalized PCE changes over time. It is  obvious that after   $180\\textup{h}$   of continuous illumination, the device  based on the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   bilayer maintains   ${\\approx}91\\%$   of its initial  efficiency. While for the same conditions, the device based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   maintains only   $83\\%$   of its initial efficiency. The stability  was also tested under ambient air (relative humidity (RH)   $75\\%)$  . After   $120\\textrm{h}$  , the devices based on   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   maintain   ${\\approx}80\\%$   of their initial efficiency and the devices based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$    only provide  $71\\%$   of their initial efficiency under the same conditions (Figure  4f). The same conclusion was also confirmed  by thermal stability measurements (Figure S18, Supporting  Information). The instability of PSCs is due to the decomposition of perovskite materials and organic hole transport layer  (HTL). The grain size of perovskite films based on  $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$    is larger compared to that of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   (Figure 1). The larger grain  size of perovskite films may partly suppress the permeation of  water at grain boundaries and increase stability. We believe that  the stability of perovksite solar cells can be improved further  if new HTL materials  and/or encapsulation methods  are  used.  \n\nIn summary, a simple and effective   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   bilayer ETL  was developed for fabricating efficient low-temperature-processed planar PSCs. The presence of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   leads to low trap  densities in perovskite films, better energy alignment, and  enhanced charge transfer, which result in higher   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and FF.  Eventually, an optimized PCE of   $23.24\\%$   (certified   $22.54\\%)$   was  obtained with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the device based  on   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ETL retains   $97.5\\%$   of its initial efficiency after  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/e7640943df38d5005622367cb5b024adc72e8436b45050b68df0a04ae04d6a55-1727127439.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $\\mathsf{I n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL. b) The corresponding EQE of the planar  structure PSC with   $\\mathsf{I n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL.

This work demonstrates that a bilayer ETL can provide  sufficient energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer for  efficient and stable photovoltaic devices. The efficiency of PSCs  can be further improved by optimizing the energy alignment  between the interface layers.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : Lead iodide   $(\\mathsf{P b}|_{2})$  , bis(tri flu oro methyl s ulf on yl)-imide  lithium  salt  (Li-TFSI),  4- tert -but yl pyr i dine  (tBP)  chl oro benzene,  dimethyl s ulf oxide  (DMSO),  N , N -dimethyl form amide  (DMF),  and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich.

Tin(IV) oxide colloid precursor was purchased from Alfa Aesar.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : First, the ITO substrates were cleaned by  detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, respectively.  The as-cleaned substrates were treated by UV–ozone for 10 min. Then,  different concentrations of indium nitrate pentahydrate were spin-coated  onto the ITO substrates at 8000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   then annealed at   $\\ 780\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $40~\\mathsf{m i n}$   in ambient air. After that, the annealed substrates were cleaned  by UV–ozone for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . Then,   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   solution was spin-coated onto  the substrates at 4000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   and annealed at   $150~^\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
