Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.

The calculation's results  reveal that the RbF modification leads to a stronger bonding  between the ETL and perovskite with a binding energy of  $-5.54$    and   $-4.38~\\mathrm{eV}$   per   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (110) unit respectively for the interface  with and without the RbF interlayer. Note that the DFT calculations for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   (110)/  $\\mathrm{{'}F A P b I_{3}}$   (110) interface gave similar  results of the binding energy.   $(-5.59$   and   $-4.61\\,\\mathrm{eV}$   for the interface with and without the RbF, respectively) It demonstrates  that the introduction of RbF energetically helps   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   contact  the perovskite and hence significantly improves the affiliation  of the interfaces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images  are shown in  Figure   3 a–c, and RbF modification seems to have  no effect on the perovskite films' surface morph o logie s. All the  perovskite films are uniform and full-coverage with similar  grain sizes. And we observed that the perovskite film based on  the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}.R b F}$   is smoother than the others. In order to verify  this phenomenon, AFM measurements were operated to investigate the surface roughness of perovskite films. Figure  S10,  Supporting Information, shows that the perovskite film based  on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF owns the lowest RMS of  .1  nm, which is  consistent with the SEM observation. X-ray diffraction (XRD)  was conducted to explore the effect of different ETLs on the  perovskite crystallization. As shown in Figure  3d, the characteristic diffraction peaks of all the perovskite films are almost  the same, along with a similar peak intensity. Note that the diffraction peak at   $12.7^{\\circ}$   with a strong peak intensity should be  assigned to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , and these moderate residues of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   could  passivate the surface or grain boundary defects of perovskite  films.  \n\nIn order to explore whether RbF penetrates into the perovskite, time-of-flight secondary ions mass spectroscopy (ToFSIMS) was\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
