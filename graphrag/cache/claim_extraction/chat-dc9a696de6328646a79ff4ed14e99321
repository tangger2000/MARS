For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.

The above results of the X-ray detector  can be explained by considering the quantum efficiency of the  internal photoelectric effect. According to quantum theory, the  wavelengths of the X-ray are on the order of the size of atoms.  As a result, they look less like waves and more like particles,  or called photons, i.e., the smallest possible unit of the radiation. In fact, the interaction between the X-ray photons and  electrons in atoms dominates the interaction between the  X-ray and perovskite QDs film. When the perovskite layer  absorbs the X-ray photon energy, high-energy electron–hole  pairs will be generated. To be exact, when the X-ray photons  pass through the atom, they interact with the electrons (in electron shells of the atoms) in the form of collision, during which  part of the photon energy will be transferred to those bound  electrons, while the rest energy is converted into kinetic energy  of these electrons. In this case, the number of electrons that  leaves the atoms depends both on the absorbed photon energy  and detecting materials. The efficiency can be defined as the  number of electron–hole pairs generated per one X-ray photon  absorbed in the detector. The binding energies of electrons on  K, L, M, and N shell in free Cs, Pb, and Br atoms are listed  in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. For example, when  a very low energy X-ray   $(100\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   interacts with the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    perovskite, there will be a high possibility of some electrons in  N and O shell of the Cs, O shell of Pb, and M shell of the Br to  be knocked out. The higher the X-ray energy that is used, the  higher the kinetic energy of electrons that are knocked loose  from its atom shell and escaped from the atoms (depending on  the binding energies). When these photoelectrons move freely  in the lattices, they can be considered as secondary electrons,  which are then mostly relax into conduction band edge. In  the meantime, the high energy of X rays can readily excite the  optical bandgap of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   per ovsk ites, producing enough  charge carriers in the valence band and conduction band after  multiple relaxation processes. Moreover, the bias voltage will  induce the electric field in the materials, which increases the  kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, thus, improving the sensitivity of the X-ray detector.  \n\nThe flexibility and durability of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   perovskitebased X-ray detectors were also investigated. A schematic of  the flexible perovskite device array is presented in  Figure   3 a. To  develop flexible op to electronic devices, perovskite device arrays  were fabricated by printing   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   thin film from solution  onto the flexible PET substrate similarly as mentioned above.  Due to the different wet t ability of the substrate, the printed  film on PET was thinner than that on the   $\\mathrm{{SiO}_{\\mathrm{{2}}}/\\mathrm{{Si}}}$   substrate.  Therefore, the dark current (Figure S3, Supporting Information) was much lower than that of the device on   $\\mathrm{{SiO}_{\\mathrm{{2}}}/\\mathrm{{Si}}}$   substrate. The bending test of the X-ray detector device on the PET  substrate was performed with different bending angles. As we  can see from Figure 3b, due to the good mechanical flexibility  of the PET substrate underlay, the real flexible device can be  bent easily in various angles. The X-ray response of the flexible  device was evaluated in the form of current under X-ray irradiation at different bending angles and after hundreds of bending  cycles. Figure 3c illustrates the current of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   perovskite-based X-ray detector arrays as a function of the voltage  (0–1 V) under the exposure of X-ray radiation   $(7.33~\\mathrm{mGy_{air}~s^{-1}})$  at different bending angles. The inset is the image of our homemade loading frame setup for bending test at a   $120^{\\circ}$   bending  angle. As it can be seen from the Figure  3c, the current was  reduced about   $25\\%$   at the   $120^{\\circ}$   angle, which was probably due  to the   $80\\%$   reduction of incident X-ray radiation due to severe  bending. Furthermore, the durability of the flexible detector was  measured against the bending cycles. Generally, a little strain  either caused by doping  or stress  can significantly change  the material properties. On the contrary, the strain produced  via 200 bending cycles degraded the current by only   $12\\%$   (see  Figure  3d), which indicates its excellent conductivity, stability  and durability, and it could be linked to uniformly growth of the  perovskite film via printing. These exciting results indicate the  high robustness and stability of our X-ray detector.

Finally, it  is also important to mention here that the calculated sensitivity  of a flexible detector is nearly   $17.7\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{Gy}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   which is lower  than of rigid detector (i.e.,   $83~\\upmu C~\\mathrm{Gy}^{-1}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ) under same softX-ray dose rate of   $7.33~\\mathrm{mGy_{air}}~S^{-}$   ${\\mathsf{S}}^{-1}$   and   $0.1\\mathrm{~V~}$   bias voltage. This  could be linked to a lower thickness of the film, producing less  charge carriers in the flexible detector.  \n\nIn conclusion, we have presented a facile approach to using  solution-processed   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs for the detection of the soft  X-rays in which a low dose of X-ray photons was directly converted into the electrical signal. This X-ray detector can sense  a very low X-ray dose rate   $({\\approx}17.2~{\\upmu}G y_{\\mathrm{air}}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  ) with a high sensitivity of   $1450~{\\upmu\\mathrm{C}}~\\mathrm{G{y_{air}}^{-1}}~{\\mathrm{cm}}^{-2}$   at only   $0.1\\mathrm{~V~}$   bias voltage. The  sensitivities achieved by this device are comparable with other  per ovsk ites X-ray detecting materials, paving the way for highly  efficient products in the near future, such as medical and X-ray  sensor. Moreover, a flexible X-ray detector arrays fabricated  by inexpensive inkjet printing is demonstrated, which could  realize the formation of a desirable pattern with a smooth  surface morphology on any required substrate. The lowtemperature solution processing of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs has the  unprecedented advantages of low cost and rapid synthesis, suggests a huge potential for the mass production of large-area, flexible next-generation X-ray detecting and imaging technologies.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis of the Perovskite QDs : The   $\\mathsf{C s P b B\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
