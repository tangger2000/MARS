Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Polarization resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{p}})$   from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  is crucial to the electrode performance. As expected,   $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$   values  are significantly reduced by the in situ exsolution operation  (Figure S10b, Supporting Information). For example,   $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$   is  reduced by   $57.9\\%$  , from   $0.280~\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   of the SFMC-GDC cell  to   $0.118\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   of the SFMC-GDC 2h cell (Figure  4b). Each  EIS data can be fitted with the equivalent circuit, that is, L1-R0- (R1-CPE1)-(R2-CPE2) (inset in Figure 4b). As proposed by the  previous studies,  the high-frequency process is assigned to  charge transfer and ion migration processes, and the low-frequency process is related to the electrochemical adsorption and  activation processes. The   $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$   values of the two cells at various  temperatures and the sub-process resistances are presented in  Figure 4c, Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information. All the  resistances are reduced significantly, and the activation energy \n\n  $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$   of the electrode reaction (R2) is decreased slightly from \n\n 110.6 to   $102.3\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}}$   (Figure 4d), illustrating the improved  catalytic activity by in situ exsolved CoFe alloy nanoparticles.  \n\nPotenti o static  tests  of  these  cells  were  conducted  (Figure S10c, Supporting Information) to measure the CO  volumetric production and corresponding Faradaic efficiencies  (Figure S10d, Supporting Information), which further confirms the enhanced performance of CoFe alloy nanoparticlesdecorated cathodes. To assess the stability and coking resistance  of SFMC-GDC and SFMC-GDC 2h cells, the current densities  at a constant voltage of   $1.2\\mathrm{~V~}$   were recorded as a function of  time, as shown in Figure 4e. The current density of the SFMCGDC 2h cell stabilizes at   ${\\approx}0.40\\;\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  and no distinct degradation is observed over   $230\\textrm{h}$  . Compared to the SFMC-GDC cell  (the decrease rate is   $8.6\\mathrm{\\mA\\h^{-1}}$  ), the stability is significantly  improved by the in situ exsolved CoFe alloy nanoparticles   $(0.17\\,\\mathrm{\\mA\\h^{-1}}$   for SFMC-GDC 2h cell), which is comparable  with the reported materials that process high stability and  Faradaic efficiencies,  and is much higher than our  previous result.  The corresponding Faradaic efficiencies fluctuate slightly above  $98.0\\%$  (Figure 4e), indicative of no coke formation, in accordance with Raman results after the stability test  (Figure S11, Supporting Information).  \n\nThe redox stability of the SFMC-GDC 2h cell was also  assessed (Figure  4f; Figures S12a and S12b, Supporting  Information). In practical applications, the SOECs are  expected with good redox cycling stability since the system  might suffer from inevitable fuel supply interruption  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/84ce76dcb155809ad2a1317e554c7de69fc6bb051c1d3dd410643e27c160a36f-1727127549.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   a–d) SEM images of SFMC (a), SFMC 1h (b), SFMC 2h (c), and SFMC 4h (d). e,f) Annular dark field (ADF) and bright field (BF) STEM images  of SFMC 2h. g) HRTEM image of SFMC 2h and h) STEM image and element maps of SFMC 2h.  \n\nduring a long-term operation. In addition, it can be a feasible strategy for solving the possible problems of particle  agglomeration and coke formation in the cathode through  redox cycles. All of the 12 redox cycles display good reproducibility,  demonstrating  excellent  redox  r ever sibi lit y.  This result is comparable with the reported materials,  such  as   $(\\mathrm{La}_{0.75}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.25})_{0.9}(\\mathrm{Cr}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.5})_{0.9}(\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Cu}_{0.5})_{0.1}\\mathrm{O}_{3-\\delta}{}^{[5]}$  and   $(\\mathrm{La}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.8})_{0.95}\\mathrm{Ti}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.1}\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.05}\\mathrm{O}_{3+\\delta}.$   Therefore, SFMCGDC 2h cell shows a high catalytic activity, stability, coking  resistance, and redox r ever sibi lit y, which make it a potential cathode material for   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis. It should be noted  that the change in the surface morphology results in slightly  improved SOEC performance (Figure S12c, Supporting  Information) since the surface of SFMC becomes rough  after exsolution/re-oxidation cycles (Figure S1h, Supporting  Information).  \n\nDFT calculations were performed to understand the mechanism of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis.   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis over SFMC surface,  RP-SFMC surface, and CoFe  $@$  SFMC (the composition of SFMC  2h) interface are investigated, including the transfer of  $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$   inside  SFMC and RP-SFMC. As the RP-SFMC could not be synthesized  using the same method as SFMC, DFT calculation prediction is  used for comparison. The potential energy diagrams in  Figure   5 and the corresponding structures in Figure S13, Supporting  Information, display the whole pathways of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis over  three patterns: SFMC (121) surface, RP-SFMC (105) (Figures S14  and S15, Supporting Information) surface, and CoFe  $@$  SFMC  interface. At   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and   $0\\ \\mathrm{V},$     $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   molecule is trapped stoutly at  CoFe  $@$  SFMC interface compared to SFMC, which is consistent  with the experimental result of enhanced adsorption of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   after  the exsolution (Figure S8, Supporting Information). By Bader  charge analysis, the active center transfers   $0.95~\\left|\\mathrm{e}\\right|$   amount of  electrons to   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   to form   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}{^{\\delta-}}$  for CoFe  $@$  SFMC, while 0.84  | e | for SFMC, indicative of the enhanced   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   adsorption of CoFe  $@$  SFMC. Then this activated   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}{^{\\delta-}}$   in CoFe  $@$  SFMC would enable  the barrier of   $0.27\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   for CO generation, and the analogous  barrier is   $0.77~\\mathrm{eV}$   in the case of SFMC (Figure  5a). Therefore,  CoFe  $@$  SFMC cathode displays enhanced  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis performance compared to SFMC and RP-SFMC cathodes (Figure S13a,  Supporting Information).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/0573d64e7617f78cb74f4034b9062cca8202abe0fa6e0d681c23713b9e3d3216-1727127620.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $1.6\\,\\lor$   and   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  . b) EIS of SFMC-GDC  and SFMC-GDC  $2\\mathsf{h}$   cells for  $\\mathsf{C O}_{2}$   electrolysis at  $1.6\\,\\lor$   and  $800~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}.$  . c) Polarization resistance values of SF\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
