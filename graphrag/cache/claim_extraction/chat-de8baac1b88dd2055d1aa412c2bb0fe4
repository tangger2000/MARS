Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The EL spectra of pristine and pristine/ABA  PeLEDs under different bias voltages from 4 to  $8\\;\\mathrm{V}$  are recorded  as shown in  Figure   6 a,b. It is observed that the EL intensity of  pristine/ABA PeLEDs increases when the bias voltage increases  from 4 to   $5\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{V}},$   and then declines at higher bias. Expectantly,  the EL peak position   $(486~\\mathrm{nm})$   and FWHM   $(\\approx\\!25\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   remain  unchanged, indicating a good spectral stability under different  bias voltages (Figure  6b). Similar to the situation of pristine/ ABA PeLEDs, the spectra of pristine PeLEDs also remain stable  in spite of the variation of EL intensity (Figure 6a). These results  undoubtedly prove the excellent spectral stability for our mixedligand perovskite systems. Regarding the operational stability,  we performed the lifetime tests of the devices under continuous  constant current driving due to the generally current driving  LEDs. We traced the efficiency of the PeLEDs under a constant  current of   $0.30~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   which can generate the highest EQE  of   $8.65\\%$   for pristine/ABA PeLEDs. It is observed that the lifetime   $T_{50}$   (defined as the elapsed time of device decaying to   $50\\%$  of its initial efficiency under continuous operation) for pristine/ ABA PeLEDs is   $81.3\\;\\mathrm{min}$   (Figure 6d), which is over 2.5-fold than  that of the pristine PeLEDs   $(32.1\\;\\mathrm{min})$  ) (Figure 6c).

Since the van der Waals gaps between the perovskite phases can destabilize the perovskite structure and thus  the device,  our results of diminishing the weak van der Waals  gap between perovskite phases through the bi functional ABA  can prolong the stability of PeLEDs. Meanwhile, the EL spectra  of pristine/ABA PeLEDs under continuous operation remain  unchanged as extending the operation time, revealing an excellent spectral stability during operation (Figure  6f). It shall be  noted that the bias voltage increases along with the operation  time as shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), showing  the increased device resistance during operation. Consequently,  our results show that the pristine/ABA PeLEDs show excellent  spectral and operational stability, which is comparable with the  reported stability of green and red analogs, signaling a great  potential for blue PeLEDs toward practical applications.  \n\nIn summary, we report to promote the coupling of quasi-2D  perovskite layers with reduction of the weak van der Waals gap  between perovskite layers by the bi functional group of amino  and carboxylic of ABA. By in-depth study of the optical and  electrical properties of pristine/ABA per ovsk ites, we demonstrate that the ABA incorporated per ovsk ites benefit an efficient  energy transfer between quasi-2D perovskite layers and thus  enhance the radiative recombination rate. Simultaneously, the  ABA can reduce traps states by suppression of metallic  $\\mathrm{Pb}$  . Combined the two advantages from the bi functional ABA incorporation, a high-performance blue PeLEDs with external quantum  efficiency of   $10.11\\%$   (average EQE of   $8.21\\%,$  ) is achieved, which is  increased over  $40\\%$   than that of pristine PeLEDs  .07%, average  EQE of   $5.84\\%$  ). Meanwhile, the pristine/ABA PeLEDs show a  prolonged operational stability of   $T_{50}=81.3$   min, which is over  2.5-fold than that of the pristine PeLEDs   $(32.1\\;\\mathrm{min})$  ) and represents one of the most stable blue PeLEDs reported so far. Consequently, our work paves an effective way to realize high-performance and stable blue PeLEDs toward practical application.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials :  Prop yl amine  hydro bromide  (PABr,   $99.999\\%,$  ),  and  ph en ethyl ammonium hydro bromide (PEABr,   $99.999\\%$  ) were purchased  from Greatcell Solar; 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA,   $97\\%$  ), Cesium  tri flu oro acetate   $(\\mathsf{C s}(\\mathsf{C F}_{3}\\mathsf{C O O}^{-})$  ,   $99.999\\%)$  ),   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$     $(99.999\\%)$  , and HBr \n\n (  $48\\%$   wt in  $\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O})$   were bought from Sigma-Aldrich.
