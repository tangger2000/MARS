Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

On the other hand, the bestperforming PSC with  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL shows a PCE of   $20.96\\%$   in RS   $(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  of   $23.06~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.153 V, and FF of 0.79) and   $20.58\\%$  in FS   $(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $23.07\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.146\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , and FF of 0.78).

Time-dependent current density and PCE measured  at the maximum power point (  $(V_{\\mathrm{max}}=0.935~\\mathrm{V}$   for   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   device  and   $V_{\\mathrm{max}}\\,{=}\\,0.995~\\mathrm{V}$   for   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -IL device), as shown in Figure   $^{3\\mathrm{e,f,}}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/7333119624a3ddaeb3412f5600238809b7f818e8efd57bb4c38a767f2057281a-1723834537.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a) Steady-state photo luminescence (SSPL) and b) time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) spectra of perovskite films with or without an  ImAcHCl layer on glass. The perovskite films were spin coated on nonconductive glass substrates and measured from glass or perovskite side (PVSK  side) where PVSK was composed of  $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.95}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.05}\\mathsf{P b I}_{2.85}\\mathsf{B r}_{0.15}$  . c) SSPL and d) TRPL spectra of perovskite films deposited on the unmodified   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and  the ImAcHCl modified   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$     $(\\mathsf{S n O}_{2^{\\cdot}}|\\mathsf{L})$  ).   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -IL films were formed on FTO substrate.  \n\nthe stabilized PCE of   $20.7\\%$   is observed after 1800 s for the \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL device, which is higher than   $18.9\\%$   for the untreated \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   device. The current density and PCE of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL  device reach immediately their maximum values, whereas  it takes about   $300\\ \\mathrm{s}$   for the control device. The faster kinetics  observed in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL is indicative of less capacitive current and  thus leads to reduced hysteresis.  \n\nSteady-state photo luminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved  photo luminescence (TRPL) are measured to understand  radiative recombination and carrier life time ( Figure    4 and Table S7 in the Supporting Information). PL intensity  decay curves are fitted using a bi-exponential decay equation of   $I(t)=I_{0}+A_{1}\\mathrm{exp}(-t/\\tau_{1})+A_{2}\\mathrm{exp}(-t/\\tau_{2})$  , where   $\\tau_{1}$   and   $\\tau_{2}$   represent  fast and slow decay time constant, respectively. Average time constant   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ave}})$   is calculated using relation  of   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ave}}\\ =\\ (A_{1}\\tau_{1}^{\\ 2}\\ +\\ A_{2}\\tau_{2}^{\\ 2})/(A_{1}\\tau_{1}\\ +\\ A_{2}\\tau_{2})$  .  As displayed in  Figure 4a, it is evidently seen that PL intensity from glass side  (light incident on glass side) is slightly higher than that from  perovskite film side when the same sample (glass/FAMA or  glass/ImAcHCl/FAMA) is illuminated on different sides. This  difference in PL intensity could be related to different defect  contents. PL intensity of the glass/ImAcHCl/FAMA sample  is markedly higher than that of the glass/FAMA reference  sample, regardless of incident sides, which is in good accordance with significantly enhanced PL lifetimes from 616.14 to  812.45  ns (Figure  4b and Table S7, Supporting Information).  This strongly suggests that ImAcHCl layer at   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2/}}$  /perovskite interface can effectively passivate the parasitic defects  from perovskite through i mid a zo liu m cation or   $C\\mathrm{l^{-}}$   anion  and thereby suppress interface non radiative recombination,  eventually resulting in improved   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  . Similar defect pass iv ation  effect has been reported in the previous work.  After  ImAcHCl interface modification, electron extraction ability is  improved in comparison with   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   control film as confirmed  by reduced PL lifetime from 68.42 to 26.35  ns, as shown in  Figure  4c,d and Table S8 in the Supporting Information.  Improved electron extraction could originate from improved  band alignment and increased conductivity after ImAcHCl  treatment for   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film, which might partially contribute to  the slightly increased  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  .  \n\nSpace-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique is usually  used to quantitatively evaluate the defect density of perovskite  films.   Figure    5 a,b illustrates the typical dark  I – V curves for electron-only devices   $(\\mathrm{FTO}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   or   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL/perov- skite/PCBM/Ag) and the defect density is estimated (Table S9,  Supporting Information). There are three regions: the Ohmic  region at low bias exhibiting linear relation between current  and electric field, the trap-filled limited region at intermediate  bias region showing a sharp increase in current, and a trapfree SCLC region at high bias. It is well known that the trap  density levels are continuously filled in the trap-filled limited  region and all the traps are filled until trap-filled limit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$   as bias increases. The trap density can be calculated  using an equation of   $n_{\\mathrm{t}}=(2\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}})/(e L^{2})$  , where   $\\varepsilon$  is the dielectric constants of perovskite,   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity,  e is the elementary charge, and   $L$   is the thickness of perovskite  film.   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is obtained by fitting the dark   $I{-}V$  curves. The  dielectric constant of the perovskite is calculated according\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
