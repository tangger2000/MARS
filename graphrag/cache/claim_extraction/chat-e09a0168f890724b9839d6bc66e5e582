Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It is interesting to note that three domain walls intersect each other. SAED patterns taken from  the domains (labeled   $\\textcircled{1}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\circled{3}\\!\\!\\!)$   in the highresolution electron microscopy (HREM)  image [Figure 4b] are given in Figure 4e–g,  respectively. The red arrows in Figure 4 e,f,i  indicate the (003) reflection. Generally, the  (00 l ) reflections with   $l=2n+1$   give the evidence of the existence of lower symmetry  space group   $P b2_{1}m$  .  The   $\\mathrm{Pb}2_{1}\\mathrm{m}$   polar  phase in the nonpolar matrix accounts for  the FIE behavior with nonzero   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   at room  temperature.

There are two types of mesoscopic domains characterized by interface  boundaries lying in   $(1\\bar{1}0)_{\\mathrm{C}}$   and   $(001)_{\\mathrm{C}}$   planes.  SAED patterns viewed along the   $[001]_{\\mathrm{C}}$   and   $[\\overline{{11}}0]_{\\mathrm{C}}$   zone axes are also given in Figure 4h,i,  which are taken from the domains (labeled  $\\circledast$  and   $\\circledast$  ) in HREM image [Figure 4d], respectively.
