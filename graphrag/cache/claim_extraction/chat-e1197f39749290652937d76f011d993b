Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

We further  carried out SEM and AFM measurements for LCE films as  shown in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), all those samples  presented fully covered film formation and smooth film surface.  \n\nFrom the above results,   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   domain is obviously detrimental  to radiative recombination. Therefore, we proceed to gain  deeper understanding about the underlying mechanism. From  Figure    4 a, pure   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   film   $(\\mathrm{P{\\mathrm{-}P D A P b B r_{4}}}$  ) presents an intense s1  excitonic peak at   $394\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   and an asymmetric PL curve with  peak at  $408\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   (PLQY:   $0.5\\%$  ). The PL tail at the low energy end  indicates continuous defect state near the band edge.  From  normalized temperature dependent PL spectra (Figure  4b),  the emission proportion at the band-tail state dramatically  decreased, simultaneously, the PL profiles became sharper and  convert to a symmetrical Lorentz-profile as the temperature  decreasing from  $300~\\mathrm{K}$   to  $80~\\mathrm{K}$  . Furthermore, the corresponding  integrated emission intensity was gradually enhanced as shown  in Figure  S12a (Supporting Information). Although, defect  states at the band edge take part in the emission process, the  vast majority of bound excitons at the band tail suffered from  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/cba273d9bf26efaf994072525fa96673e2ffb11a9bb318c5baae1fa9199d2993-1723834752.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   a) Schematic diagram of low-dimensional components engineering. b) Absorption and PL spectra of three LCE films, where different amount  of  $\\mathsf{P}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{P D A B r}_{2}$   are replaced by PEABr and marked as  $\\mathsf{P2m}$  ,  $\\mathsf{P2m2}$  , and  $\\mathsf{P2m3}$  . c) The corresponding TA spectra for   $\\mathsf{P2m}]$  ,  $\\mathsf{P2m2}$  , and   $\\mathsf{P2m3}$   films. d) Decay  kinetics at  $\\mathsf{n}_{\\rceil}$  ,  $\\mathsf{n}_{2,}$   and  $\\mathsf{n}_{3}$   domains extracted from (c). e) Proportion of excitonic peaks   $(\\mathsf{n}_{2}/\\mathsf{n}_{1})$   integrated from (b) versus depopulation time at excitation  , state of   $\\mathsf{n}_{\\rceil}$   domain, and the PLQY for various films. f) Photograph of   $\\mathsf{P2m2}$   films excited under UV radiation   $(365~\\mathsf{n m})$  .  \n\nnon radiative pathway.  Meanwhile,   $\\mathrm{{P}{\\mathrm{cdot}}\\mathrm{{PDAP}}\\mathrm{{bBr}}_{4}}$   film has a  PL lifetime ( τ ) of 1.8 ns (Figure S12b, Supporting Information),  from which a large non radiative constant of   $5.53\\times10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   can  be extracted (Supporting Information) indicative of an ultrafast  energy loss. We take the view that enhanced radiative recombination can be achieved by screening   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   domain. Photoluminescence excitation spectra (PLE) and excitation wavelength  dependent PLQY analysis were therefore conducted based on  P2   $\\mathrm{(n_{1}}$   domain abundant) and   $\\mathrm{P}2\\mathrm{m}2$     $\\mathrm{(n_{1}}$   domain scarce) films  (Figure 4c,d), where four excitation wavelengths (EX): 380 nm,   $394\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   (absorption peak of   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   domain,   $\\mathrm{{Mn}_{1}}$  ),   $410\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , and   $424\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   (absorption peak of   $\\mathrm{n}_{2}$   domain,   $\\mathrm{Ar}_{2}$  ) were employed  to selectively excite low-dimensional components in quasi2D perovskite films. Entire domains would be involved in  the emission process under EX of 380 and   $394~\\mathrm{nm}$  , while EX  of 410 and   $424~\\mathrm{nm}$   would only excite   $\\mathrm{n}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domains. By  this way, we can emphasize the exciton contributions from   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$  domain. The P2 film presented low PLQY under excitation of  380 and   $394~\\mathrm{nm}$  , which indicates a trap assisted non radiative  recombination in   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   domain. Significantly enhanced PLQY  of   $50\\%$   was achieved by tuning EX to   $410\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   and longer. It  directly reflects the importance of domain screening. For  comparison,   $\\mathrm{P}2\\mathrm{m}2$   maintained high PLQY about   $75\\%$   to   $77\\%$    regardless of domain screening. The emission mechanism of  P2 and   $\\mathrm{P}2\\mathrm{m}2$   films are presented in Figure 4e. Above results  unravel the critical merit of LCE, more importantly, the emission mechanism of LCE film absolutely favors EL in which all  domains in quasi-2D film would be involved in exciton transfer  and recombination processes.  \n\nWe thus fabricated LEDs with structure of PVK/PFI/LCE  film (P2m2)/3TPYMB/Liq/Al, we present the cross-sectional  transmission electron microscope (TEM) image in  Figure    5 a.
