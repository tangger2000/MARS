The focus of the text is on the synthesis and characterization of quasi-2D perovskite solar cells, discussing materials, methods, and properties, but not the specified entity types.<|>The energy-level diagram is shown in Figure 1b,  wherein the energy level values for perovskite and PTAA were  obtained from the previous reports.  In this device structure, PTAA acts as the hole extraction layer and   $\\mathrm{PC}_{61}\\mathrm{BM}$   as the  electron transporting layer. Quasi-2D perovskite films were  prepared by using a precursor solution of 3BBAI, methylammonium chloride (MACl), and lead iodide   $\\left(\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\right)$   with a molar  ratio of 2:2:3.  The content of MACl and 3BBAI reactants  was successively adjusted to perform initial efficiency optimization of quasi-2D perovskite solar cells. Figure  S1 (Supporting  Information) shows the photovoltaic parameters of the various  quasi-2D perovskite solar cells under the standard   $\\mathrm{AM1.5G}$   illumination. The devices based on 3BBAI, MACl and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   with  a molar ratio of 1.8:2.5:3 (corresponding to   $3<n<4$  ) exhibit an  optimized PCE of up to   $16.31\\%$  . Based on the best molar ratio,  we further optimized device performance and recorded the  current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   curve of the champion cell. The   $J{-}V$   curves presented in Figure 1c were measured with a scanning rate of   $0.02\\;\\mathrm{V}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   in both forward- and reverse-scan modes  under AM1.5G illumination. Negligible variation of   $J{-}V$  charact eris tics was observed between the two modes, suggesting  almost no hysteresis in our quasi-2D perovskite solar cells. A  peak PCE of   $18.20\\%$   is achieved, mainly due to an extremely  high open-circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   of   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   along with a good fill  factor (FF) of 0.812, in spite of a relatively low short-circuit  current density   $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\right)$   of   $18.22\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}^{-2}}$  . Incident photon-toelectron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was carried  out to validate the solar simulator measurement of device  performance. As displayed in Figure  1d, the IPCE spectrum  shows an onset of around   $790\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$     $(\\approx\\!1\\%$   IPCE) and exhibits  quantum efficiency value of over   $70\\%$   from 360 to   $660\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ,  reaching a maximum of   $86\\%$   at   $510\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . The integrated   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  from the IPCE spectrum is calculated to be   $17.77\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$  ,  which matches well   $({\\approx}2.5{\\%})$   the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   measured under AM1.5G  standard irradiation. We prepared 85 cells independently under  the same experimental conditions. The histogram of average  PCEs (Figure 1e) shows that  ${\\approx}85\\%$   of cells had PCEs exceeding   $16\\%$   under one sun illumination with an average efficiency  of  ${\\approx}16.53\\%$  .  \n\nConsidering the ubiquitous presence of humidity (from  water vapor in air) and water (from rain) in all realistic operating  conditions of solar cells, we evaluated the stability of our quasi2D perovskite devices under the atmospheric humidity and  the water-soaking stress, respectively. Figure  1f illustrates the  evolution of normalized photovoltaic parameters over time  for an un encapsulated device, which is stored in a chamber  at room temperature with a relative humidity of   ${\\approx}40\\%$  , and  carried out the   $J{-}V$   tests at room temperature in ambient air.  The device exhibits robust stability, retaining   $82\\%$   of its initial  efficiency after aging   $2400\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$  . We note that a humidity of   ${\\approx}40\\%$  does not decrease the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of the quasi-2D perovskite  solar cell, but rather affects the FF. The water-soaking test was  further carried out by using a larger device with active area of   $0.49\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  . We compared the  $J{-}V$  characteristics before and after  immersion in water for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$  . The pristine device shows a PCE  of   $12.9\\%$     $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}{\\colon14.42\\ \\mathrm{mA}}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\colon1.18\\ \\mathrm{V},$   and FF: 0.760) under  one sunlight illumination. Very encouragingly, no efficiency  drop was observed in the quasi-2D perovskite device after water  immersion, and the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   (  $14.16\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}$  ),   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   (1.18 V), and FF  (0.770) remain almost unchanged. The detailed procedures of  the water-soaking test are shown in a Movie S1 (Supporting  Information). The robust stability of the unsealed large-area  device in water represents a major progress in stabilizing the  perovskite solar cells against moisture and liquid water.  \n\nTo reveal the origin of the excellent device performance,  we investigated the quality of perovskite films as the photoactive layers. We first investigated the morphology of the quasi2D perovskite film by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  and atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements. From the  top view SEM image in  Figure 2 a, we observed a full-coverage  film with densely packed micrometer-scale crystalline grains.  The AFM image (Figure  S2, Supporting Information) shows  that the quasi-2D perovskite film has very smooth surface with  a low root-mean-square roughness   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{rms}}\\right)$   of   ${\\approx}10.7$    nm.
