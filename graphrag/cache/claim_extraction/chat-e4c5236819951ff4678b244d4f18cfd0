Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

After heat treatment (FigureÂ 3a), the peak at   $19.97^{\\circ}$   moves to a  larger angle of about   $20.24^{\\circ}$  ,  indicating the semi-crystalline   $\\beta$  -phase of PVDF domains after thermal annealing treatment.  \n\nThe full X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of  the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers is shown in  FigureÂ 3c. XPS analysis of the high-resolution spectra involving  Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and  $\\operatorname{Br}\\,3\\mathrm{d}$   is then conducted to further clarify the  existences of NCs and their electronic states. FigureÂ 3d shows  the typical Cs 3d spectrum, in which the strong peaks at 723.85  and  .86Â  eV are corresponding to Cs   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and Cs   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$  ,  respectively, suggesting that there is no CsBr primal reactant  but added to the perovskite structure as a monovalent ion in the  as-prepared   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers.  The two Br  3d signals, corresponding to   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   and   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   peaks, are clearly  seen in the   $\\operatorname{Br}\\,3\\mathrm{d}$   spectrum (FigureÂ 3e). As for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$  fiber, the Br   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   and   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   peaks in   $\\operatorname{Br}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}$   spectrum have  shifted to higher binding energy, indicating the modified chemical environment of   $\\mathrm{[PbBr]^{-}}$   anion and the stronger   $\\operatorname{Pb-Br}$   interactions after addition of PVDF. As shown in FigureÂ 3f, the Pb  4f spectrum for the primitive NCs has been recorded with two  contributions   $4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2}$   and   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   locating at 142.96 and   $138.10\\ \\mathrm{eV},$    respectively, which correspond to   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   cations. The mole ratio  of Cs, Pb, and Br, as determined by XPS, is about 1:1:3, which is  in agreement with the stoic hio me try ratio of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  .  \n\n# 2.3.

Under the condition of frequency of   $1~\\mathrm{Hz}$   and effective size  of   $0.80~\\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$  , the piezoelectric output of composite fibers  based PENG with the periodic horizontal compression and  release processes are measured by force simulator. As shown  in  Figure   4 , in order to confirm that the power output originates from   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers rather than  other factors including the test system, the devices without  fibers (blank) and with pure PVDF fibers are tested under the  same conditions for comparison. It can be clearly seen that  the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device without fiber originate from noise and can be negligible compared to that of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers based PENG (FigureÂ 4a,b).  Furthermore, the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device with  pure PVDF fibers (6Â  V,   $10\\,\\,\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{A\\,\\,cm}^{-2})$  ) are relatively smaller  than that of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers based PENG  (103Â  V,   $170~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ), implied the key role of piezoelectric  effect of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  . Switching-polarity tests are also carried  out to verify the generated output signals originated from  the piezoelectric phenomenon. A negative output signal is  observed when the PENG is connected in forward connection (FigureÂ 4c). While under a reverse connection, an oppo- site output signal is measured as shown in FigureÂ  4d. It is  obvious that the electric signals are reversible, indicating that  the detected outputs are produced from the PENG strained  by compressing motion.  And a difference of voltage peak  values between compressing and releasing conditions is also  observed, which can be explained by the difference of the  strain rate in the process of applying and removing the stress  on the piezoelectric nano generator.  \n\nIn order to fabricate high performance   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$  composite fibers based PENG, the effects of some key paraÂ­ meters, such as mass ratio of PVDF to  ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  , electro spinning  time, polarization voltages, as well as fabrication method, are  also investigated. As shown in  Figure   5 a, the electro spinning  time and polarization voltage are set to 1Â min and   $5\\;\\mathrm{kV}.$  . When  the mass ratio of PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   are kept at 8, 6, 3, 2, 1.50,  1, and 0.80, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device is 25, 36, 87, 170, 21,  20, and   $15~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
