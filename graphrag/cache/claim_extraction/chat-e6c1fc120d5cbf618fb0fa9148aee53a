Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

We also investigated the charge carrier dynamics of the pristine 2D perovskite  film deposited on glass substrates and its thickness was determined to be  ${\\approx}500\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   by a pro filo meter. As shown in the TRPL  result of the pristine 2D perovskite film (Figure S8a, Supporting  Information), the average lifetime was fitted to be 1.43 ns,  which was much smaller than those of 3D and 2D-3D samples. This was because the charge-carrier diffusion length of \n\n  $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$     $(\\approx\\!60\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   was much smaller than the film thickness \n\n  $(500\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ), leading to severe bulk recombination.  To investigate the influence of 2D perovskite layer on the charge transport dynamics at the interface of perovskite and HTM layers, we  prepared another set of samples by coating HTM layer on the  top of various perovskite films on glass substrates and the TRPL  spectra were measured on these samples as shown in Figure 4h.  When contacting with HTM layer, the HTM quenched the emission of perovskite films and all samples including the 2D perovskite sample (Figure S8b, Supporting Information) exhibited  decreased PL lifetime, which confirms the injection of holes  from the perovskite layer into the HTM layer. As shown in Table  S2 (Supporting Information), the PL lifetime calculated for 3D  perovskite/HTM sample was   $117.0~\\mathrm{ns}$  , while much shorter lifetime of 26.3 ns was obtained for the 2D-3D perovskite/HTM  sample, which indicates faster hole extraction. We attributed  the facilitated hole extraction at 2D-3D perovskite/HTM interface to the reduced inter facial non radiative recombination and  optimized energy band alignment. The in situ grown thin 2D  perovskite capping layer acted as a pass iv ation layer that can  effectively eliminate the trap states at the 3D perovskite surface and suppressed the non radiative recombination. This has  already been verified in the steady-state PL spectra as shown in  Figure S2b (Supporting Information). Furthermore, the passivation of subgap defect states by the 2D perovskite capping layer  led to an optimized energy band alignment between the 2D-3D  perovskite film and the HTM layer.  Thus, more efficient hole transfer from the 3D perovskite layer to HTM layer  can be obtained in the 2D-3D PSCs.  \n\nIn addition to the enhanced photovoltaic performance,  the moisture stability of the fabricated PSCs is significantly  improved by employing 2D-3D perovskite films. After exposure in the ambient environment with RH   $60\\pm10$   for   $2000{\\mathrm{~h~}}$  ,  the pristine 3D perovskite films experienced a fast degradation to   $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$   (non per ovsk it e yellow phase) and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , corre- sponding to the emerged peak at   $11.2^{\\circ}$   and the intensified peak  at  $12.7^{\\circ}$   in the XRD pattern ( Figure   5 a), respectively.  In sharp  contrast, no obvious change is observed in the XRD pattern of  2D-3D perovskite film, indicating the superior moisture stability. Thereafter, we have also evaluated the long-term stability  of perovskite devices with and without 2D perovskite capping  layer in the ambient conditions with RH   $60\\pm10$   as shown in  Figure 5b. During the long-term stability monitoring in terms  of PCE, the majority of initial efficiency is lost rapidly in typical devices based on pristine 3D perovskite, while the PSCs  employing 2D-3D perovskite films (PEAI $1~\\mathrm{mg~mL^{-1}}$  ) demonstrate much better stability and maintain almost   $90\\%$   of the  original PCE after   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$  . During the long-term exposure in  a humid environment, the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF of the controlled devices  experienced a rapid decline, while those of 2D-3D PSCs keep  quite constant (Figure S6b–d, Supporting Information). These  well-maintained photovoltaic parameters of the 2D-3D PSCs  can be ascribed to the increased moisture resistance as well as  suppressed ion migration from 2D perovskite capping layers  with large and hydrophobic   $\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}$  cations.  Note that the  thicknesses of the 2D perovskite capping layers in this study  are very small. By increasing the concentration of PEAI solution to   $8~\\mathrm{mg~mL^{-1}}$  , the thickness of the 2D perovskite capping  layer can be up to   ${\\approx}30\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , as shown in Figure S9 (Supporting  Information). The resultant thicker 2D perovskite capping  layers enabled the fabrication of even more stable PSCs  (Figure 5b), retaining   $93\\%$     $(4~\\mathrm{mg~mL^{-1}})$  ) and   $97\\%$     $(8\\mathrm{~m}\\mathrm{g}\\mathrm{~m}\\mathrm{L}^{-1})$  )  of initial PCEs, respectively; though the PCEs were slightly  lower (Figure S6a, Supporting Information). To the best of our  knowledge, the surpassing 1000 h stability with a high PCE  value over   $16\\%$   for unsealed PSCs exposing to a highly humid  environment   $\\langle>\\!\\mathrm{RH}~60\\rangle$   has not been witnessed in previously  reported 2D-3D PSCs (Table S1, Supporting Information). With  proper encapsulation, we expect the device lifespan can be further prolonged toward future commercialization.  \n\nIn addition, the thermal stability of 2D-3D PSCs was investigated  by heating the devices on a hotplate at different temperatures  in nitrogen atmosphere (Figure S10, Supporting Information).  Under continuous thermal treatment at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $100\\textup{h}$  , the  3D PSCs lost the majority of the initial performance, while the  2D-3D PSCs with   $1~\\mathrm{mg~mL^{-1}}$   PEAI post-treatment can retain  around   $75\\%$   of the original PCE under the same conditions.  Such significantly improved thermal stability in the 2D-3D PSCs  may be due to the suppressed iodide ion diffusion by the 2D  perovskite capping layer. Compared to the 3D perovskite material  with a small binding energy of  ${\\approx}2\\;\\mathrm{meV};$  , 2D perovskite   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$  has a relatively large binding energy of   $230~\\mathrm{meV},$   which needs  much higher activation energy to induce ion migration upon  heating.  As a thermal-stable layer, the 2D perovskite capping layer can effectively block the iodide ion diffusion from the  3D perovskite film to the HTM and electrode.  With thicker  2D perovskite capping layers   $(8\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$   PEAI), the 2D-3D PSCs  demonstrated even better thermal stability, maintaining nearly   $90\\%$   of the original PCE after   $100\\textrm{h}$   at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . When aging at  an elevated temperature of   $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the 2D-3D PSCs based on  the thin and thick 2D perovskite capping layers still can retain  around 60 and  $\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
