Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The combination of  PLQY and PL decay dynamics confirms that   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD inks can achieve near-unity radiative decay in their excited states in a single  channel. Consequently, the intrinsic decay  channel of the excited states of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD  inks can be nearly completely radiated, which  is expected to construct high-performance  QLEDs.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/0a2fb6f4762dbcfa56116aa24a31a38460fc2c825471f2cb19c92073baf467ee-1723833204.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   Highly luminescent, smooth, and compact QD films. a) Photograph of high bright   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   and FA-doped  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QD films. b) Their corresponding PL spectra. c) Atomic force  microscopy (AFM) images of FA-doped   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QD films.

DDAB as a ligand is onto the QD surface  through   $\\mathrm{\\DDA^{+}}$   with the negative sites   $\\left(\\mathrm{Br}^{-}\\right)$   or adsorbed  $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   on  the QD surface. OTAc as a ligand can be inferred from the  emergence of   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   stretching vibration band at   $1709~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   in  the spectrum of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)  (Figure S3, Supporting Information) through the bonding of  carboxyl group and lead. The detailed effect of ligands on the  ink and op to electronic properties is demonstrated as follows.  \n\nuse of the   ${\\mathsf{C}}_{18}$   alkyl chain ligand of oleic acid (OAc). The electrical properties of QDs were analyzed by electron-only and  hole-only devices presented in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). Compared with the QDs synthesized using OAc, both  electron and hole currents obviously increase, demonstrating  the improved electron injection and transportation efficiency.  This finding is attributable to the particles with long   $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{18}\\right)$    hydrocarbon chains of OAc creating higher insulating barriers  around each QD compared to the   $(C_{8})$   hydrocarbon chains of  OTAc, which is related to the carbon content confirmed by  XPS and FTIR (Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information).  Such an improvement is also confirmed by the typical QLEDs  measured in the range of low and high voltages as shown in  Figure 1f and Figure S11 (Supporting Information). The corresponding current densities improved substantially, for instance,  from 183 to   $288~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at   $5\\;\\mathrm{V}.$   These results indicate that the  charge injection capacities and transport properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    QDs can be boosted by using short ligands (OTAc), which are  also anticipated to be useful in constructing high-performance  QLEDs.  \n\nFirst, TOAB can improve the dissolution ability of   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$   and  avoid accelerating QD degradation by coordinating the lead species and proton exchange with acid ligands, which is caused by  oleylamine (typical ligands in the HI process).  Thus, highly  stable QD ink stored for 1 month can be obtained through our  proposed amine-free reaction systems (Figure 1e). High ink  stability can guarantee high uniformity and compactness of the  assembled QD thin film as shown in  Figure   2 , avoid current  leakage, and improve the efficiency of QLED devices.  \n\nSecond, the DDAB used in the treatment process can endow  the QDs strong PL features and uniform dispersity in solvent to  form stable ink. The enhanced PL was confirmed by the comparison of the QD crude solution before and after treatment  (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The treated sample exhibits  stronger PL properties, which could be attributed to the introduction of DDAB creating a Br-rich environment  (the content  of Br confirmed by the XPS results is presented in Figure S5 in  the Supporting Information). Apart from the improvement of  PL, DDAB can also improve the dispersion of QDs as well as  ink stability (Figure 1e). The untreated QDs purified by ethyl  acetate are difficult to disperse in hexane and octane to form  uniform ink (Figure S6, Supporting Information), whereas  \n\nIn addition to QD inks with superior PL properties, their  films also exhibit high-luminescent properties with PLQY  (as high as of   $46\\%$  ) qualified by absolute PLQY measurements  (Figure 2a). Importantly, the PLQY of films can further be  improved by adding a small amount of  $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   dopant (up to   $61\\%$  ).  The FA-doped   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   films show a brighter and more uniform green PL under ultraviolet lamp excitation, directly confirmed by the corresponding PL spectra measured under the  same conditions (Figure 2b). The PL emission peak of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    shifts slightly from 512.9 to   $514.7\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   after adding   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  , indicating that a small fraction of FA cations is successfully introduced into the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   crystal lattice, which is confirmed by  the XRD results (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The FAdoped   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs with a certain doped concentration exhibit  similar morphology to pure   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs by TEM images  (Figure S13, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the films  deposited by spin-coating of the QD inks show dense, uniform,  and crack-free morphology, and a very smooth surface with a  root-mean-square surface roughness of   $2.3\\ \\mathrm{\\nm}$   (Figure 2c;  Figure S14, Supporting Information). The high flat QD films  are highly desired in constructing high-performance optoelectronic devices.  \n\nThe increase in PL of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD films after introducing  the   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   cations is further analyzed by time-resolved PL decay  (Figure 2d; Table S1, Supporting Information). The timeresolved PL curves are fit to bi-exponential decays, where the  slow decay is ascribed to radiative recombination of the single  excitons.  The lifetime   $(\\tau_{2})$   of the slow decay component of  doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD films is   $37.8~\\mathrm{ns}$  , longer than that of pure  QD films, indicating less surface and bulk defects for QD  films after adding the FA dopant. The longer   $\\tau_{2}$   also reflects  high-quality QD films with less non radiative recombination  centers, which is favorable to reduce the trapping of excitons  and enhance the recombination efficiency of electrons and  holes.  \n\nThe robustness of highly luminescent properties and effective electrical injection and transportation features of QD films  are expected to reach high exciton recombination efficiency in  devices. The device performance of QLED based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs is presented in  Figure   3 . The device (Figure 3a) consists\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
