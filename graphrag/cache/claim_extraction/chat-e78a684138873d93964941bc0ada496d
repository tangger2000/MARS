Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

The elemental ratios in the perovskite films with different   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additives calculated from the  integral intensities of the peaks of each element. The results  were shown in Table S5 in the Supporting Information.  \n\nFinally, the long-term st abilities of un encapsulated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    films with different concentrations of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additives are tested  in air with a high relative humidity (RH) of   ${\\approx}40\\%$  . As shown in  Figure   5 , where the stability of the perovskite film is positively  related to the  $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   concentration, it is obvious that the perovskite films with higher concentrations of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive show  higher stability. The improved stability of the perovskite films  could be ascribed to the pass iv ation effect of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  . To evaluate  the stability of the complete   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs, un encapsulated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs without and with   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive are stored  and tested in air (RH:   ${\\approx}25\\%$  ). As shown in Figure S12 in the  Supporting Information, the optimized device showed a slow  decrease of PCE over time, maintaining   ${\\approx}90\\%$   of its initial efficiency after   $1080\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$  . During the same aging process, the PCE of  the control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSC dropped dramatically to  ${\\approx}70\\%$   of its  initial value. These results indicate that the optimized  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    PSCs demonstrate better stability than the control devices; the  enhanced stability of the optimized PSCs is probably due to the  surface pass iv ation effect of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   on the perovskite film.   Operational stability of the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSC was measured using a Xenon lamp at   $\\mathrm{AM1.5}$   solar illumination in air  (RH:   ${\\approx}25\\%$  ).  As shown in Figure S13 in the Supporting  Information, the optimized device without encapsulation can  supply a stable efficiency output of over   $16\\%$   for   $150\\;\\mathrm{min}$  .  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we have performed a systematic study on the  effect of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films and PSCs. We demonstrate that calcium cannot be incorporated into the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    lattice but rather serves to passivate and dope the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    materials.   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive can significantly enhance the crystallinity of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film to decrease the trap state density and  prolong the carrier lifetime. In addition, the Fermi level of the \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   was raised to lie close to the conduction band by the \n\n  $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive, leading to a larger   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   and thus a much higher   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.32\\mathrm{~V~}$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs. As a result, a record PCE of   $16.79\\%$   was obtained in planar   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs. Therefore, our  work suggests a new route to further improve the efficiency and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of one-step-fabrication   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells, which is desirable for perovskite/silicon tandem cells and other optoelectronic devices.  \n\n# 4.
