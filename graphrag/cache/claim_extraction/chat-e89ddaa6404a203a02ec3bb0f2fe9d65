We found that the defect-state density was   $1.48\\;\\times\\;10^{16}\\;\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/C s P b I_{2}B r}$   film and   $9.47~\\times~10^{15}~\\:\\mathrm{{cm}}^{-3}$   for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N/C s P b I_{2}B r}$   film. The  decrease in defect-state density of the latter case could be attributed to the enhanced crystal lin it y, larger grain sizes (fewer  grain boundaries), and the effective surface pass iv ation of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film by the PN4N layer.  \n\nTo better understand the interactions at the interfaces  between the perovskite and different ETLs, both surface analysis study and theoretic calculation were performed. First,  the bonding interactions between the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and PN4N  were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  measurement, which probes the chemical state of the atoms at  the very top surface   $(\\approx\\!10\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  . Therefore, a thin layer of PN4N   $(8\\;\\mathrm{nm})$   was coated on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film for the study.  Figure   3   showed that the Cs 3d and Pb 5f peaks were both shifted  toward lower binding energy while the N 1s peak from the  PN4N shifted toward higher binding energy when compared  to the reference samples. This suggested that the electron density around the metal atoms was increased and that around the  nitrogen atom was decreased, revealing that the electron lone  pairs on the N atom could donate to both the metal cations,  forming coordination bonds. Similarly, the strong interaction  between PDCBT and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  could also be confirmed by formation of the   $_{S-C s}$   and   $_{\\mathrm{S-Pb}}$   bonds (Figure S4, Supporting  Information), which have been employed to passivate perovskite surface trap states.  \n\nIn addition, we also performed electronic structure  calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the chemical bonding and pass iv ation mechanism at the   $\\mathrm{{PM4N}/C s P b I_{2}B r}$   and PDCBT   $/\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   interfaces. Two surfaces terminated with the (100) and (110) planes were used for  the calculations as those crystallography planes were found to  be dominated from the XRD study. The under-coordinated   $C s^{+}$    ions could be passivated by   $_{\\mathrm{N-Cs}}$   and   $_{S-C s}$   bonds, while the   $_\\mathrm{N-Pb}$     $\\mathrm{(N-Pb:~}\\bar{3.05\\mathrm{~\\AA}})$   and   $_{\\mathrm{S-Pb}}$   (S  Pb: 2.89 Å) bonds could  passivate the deep-level antisite defects.  In our calculation,  (110) plane and (100) plan exhibit similar defect and electronic  properties. As illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure S5 (Supporting  Information), the electron distribution was localized around  the antisite defect site on the (110) and (100) surfaces, which  could trap charge carriers and increase charge recombination.  With PN4N and PDCBT, however, the antisite defect states are  passivated through the formation of   $_\\mathrm{N-Pb}$  and   $_{\\mathrm{S-Pb}}$   bonds,  resulted in a delocalized electron distribution in the perovskite  lattice. Therefore, the introduction of dual PN4N and PDCBT  inter layers can effectively lower the density of inter facial defect  states.  \n\nThe effects of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N}$   on the PVSC  performance were evaluated based on the conventional device  structure   $(\\mathrm{ITO/ETL/C s P b I_{2}B r/P D C B T/M o O_{3}/A g})$  .

Such modification can enhance the builtin potential within the device and reduce inter facial recombination due to the trap pass iv ation by PN4N, which consequently  resulted in   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement of the PVSC.  As depicted  in  Figure   4 a and  Table   1 , the devices based on the optimized  inter layers delivered a simultaneous increase in   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   FF, and   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $1.30~\\mathrm{V},$  ,   $81.5\\%$   and   $15.3\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , respectively, leading to  a much higher PCE of   $16.2\\%$  .
