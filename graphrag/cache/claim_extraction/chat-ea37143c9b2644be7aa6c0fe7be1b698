Using temperature-dependent photo luminescence spectroscopy, we investigated the dynamics of photo generated excitons in the control and treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms. We monitored the emission characteristics of the two   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$  ﬁlms, and found all  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms show a slight increase in integrated PL intensity with decreasing temperature from 300 to  $100~\\mathrm{{K}}$  , ascribed to reduced exciton dissociation and non radiative trapping ( Figure  2 a,b ). The suppressed red-shift of treated ﬁlms suggests the removal of mid-gap states, resulting from the better pass iv ation of the bi-ligand strategy (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). Furthermore, we extracted the exciton binding energy of each   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlm by plotting the integrated PL emission intensity as a function of inverse temperature [ 27 ]  $$ {\\frac{1}{I\\left(T\\right)}}={\\frac{1}{I_{\\mathrm{0}}}}+{\\frac{A}{I_{\\mathrm{0}}}}\\exp\\left(-{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{b}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}\\right) $$  where    $I_{0}$   is the initial integrated emission intensity at   $0\\,\\mathrm{~K~}$  ,    $E_{\\flat}$  is exciton binding energy,    $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$   is the Boltzmann constant, and A  is the pre-exponential parameter. We calculated the    $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   by ﬁtting the temperature-dependent PL intensity spectra and obtained the largest exciton binding energy of   $144~\\mathrm{meV}$   for the treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms: this represents a 1.6-fold related to the control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms (Figure  2c ). This indicates that the introduction of AHI/OI further enhances the exciton binding energy of nano crystals, thereby promoting the eﬃcient recombination of electrons and holes. 28–30 ]   The high exciton binding energy of treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms coincided with the high PLQY of  ${\\approx}92\\%$  . We calculated the electron–phonon coupling strength by ﬁtting the temperature of the FWHM using the following equation [ 31 ]  $$ \\mathrm{FWHM}\\left(T\\right)=\\frac{A}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{LO}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)-1}+C $$  where FWHM involves the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon contribution and includes the Bose–Einstein distribution term (Figure  2d ). The in homogeneous broadening term    $C$   corresponds to the FWHM at low temperatures, where not much thermal broadening occurs. The broadened linewidth resulting from the exciton–phonon scattering is the reason why the FWHM showed a temperature dependence. We conducted further analysis by comparing the changes in FWHM, and found that the treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms exhibit reduced FWHM values and smaller changes in FWHM compared to the control  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms: the FWHM of treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms are    ${\\approx}4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   narrower at room temperature   $(27\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ). These together suggest that the bi-ligand treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms have less phonon eﬀect because of improved ligand rigidity and less vibration-induced non-recombination. We employed ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (FETs) to study the inplane conductivity of control and treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms. The  $I{-}V$   curve of treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms exhibited an 8.1-fold increase in slope compared to the control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms, suggesting improved current density at the same voltage. By combining the    $I{-}V$   slope with the channel length and width, we obtained the conductivity   $(\\sigma)$   of   $5.04\\times10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{S\\m^{-1}}$    for the treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms: this represents an order of magnitude higher than that of the control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms   $(6.22\\times10^{-6}\\mathrm{~S~m^{-1}})$  (Figure  2f ). The higher conductivity results from the reduced trap density and removed OI ligands, as evidenced by the high PLQY of  $92\\%$   and  $66\\%$   reduced integrated intensity from the 1H NMR spectra (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). 24 ] We built hole-only and electron-only devices to study electrical transport mobility and density of trap states)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1.
