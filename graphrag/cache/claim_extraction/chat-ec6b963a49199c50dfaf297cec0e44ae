Introduction  \n\nII–VI, III–V, and perovskite compounds, color conversion QD  films, and QLEDs, will be discussed.  \n\nQuantum dots (QDs) have emerged as next-generation semiconducting materials due to their tunable bandgaps and function aliz able characteristics.  QDs are being applied in various  devices in the fields of displays, photovoltaics, and transistors.  Among these, QDs have recently been commercialized in display applications in the form of QD films for liquid  crystal display (LCD) panels, and they will soon be applied  in color conversion matrices in micro light-emitting diodes   $(\\upmu$  -LED) and self-emitting layers in quantum dot light-emitting  diodes (QLEDs), due to their narrow-emission spectra, wide  color gamut, and high quantum yield.  QLEDs have recently  \n\n# 2. Degradation Mechanism of QDs  \n\n# 2.1. Influences of Oxygen and Water Combined with Light  \n\nQDs are known to be degraded via various molecular interactions with oxygen and water. Oxygen and water physically and/ or chemically adsorb on the QD surface, which can enhance  or degrade their optical performance.  Studies of the degradation mechanism and stability of colloidal QDs have mainly  focused on Cd-based QDs. CdSe QDs have been reported to  show enhanced PL when exposed to moisture under light  illumination; this phenomenon is called photo activation. This  enhancement in QD performance is believed to result from the  pass iv ation of surface trap states by the adsorbed water molecules.  The pass iv ation of trap states allows electrons  to repopulate from the trap states to the conduction band of  the QDs, resulting in increased band-edge radiative recombination.  This process can be reversed by detaching  the ph ys is or bed water molecules with inert-gas purging or  vacuum degassing, as shown in  Figure   1 .  Photo activation  by chem is or bed oxygen has also been reported. When photoexcited QDs are exposed to oxygen, they undergo surface oxidation; this mechanism is called photo oxidation. As shown in  Figure   2 , photo oxidation converts the surface of the CdSe QDs  to CdO,  $\\mathrm{{se}O_{2}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{CdSeO}_{x}$  .  The QD surface trap states are  also eliminated by pass iv ation by   $\\mathrm{{se}O_{2}}$   and/or by smoothing  through the dissociation of   $\\mathrm{{se}O_{2}}$  .  Photo activation has been  reported to occur mainly due to the pass iv ation of trap states on  the surface of the CdSe core, rather than on the shell.  \n\nHowever, the optical characteristics of QDs are irreversibly  degraded when photo excited QDs are continuously exposed  to oxygen molecules for long periods.  Long-term oxygen  exposure induces the formation of surface trap states and  causes permanent fluorescence quenching. Ions such as  $\\mathrm{{seO^{3-}}}$    and   $C_{ Ḋ }\\mathrm{d}^{2+} Ḍ$   are produced by photo oxidation, and dissociate from  the core in a process called photo corrosion.  Photo corrosion  generates surface trap states and causes a reduction in the core  size, resulting in permanent PL quenching, spectrum broadening, and a blueshift of the band-edge emission.  The  stability of photo luminescence characteristics can be enhanced  by shell engineering.  However, it is difficult to protect  the cores if the shells are not grown epi taxi ally on the core surface.  None pit axial growth of the shells may occur due  to lattice mismatch between CdSe and   $Z\\mathrm{n}S$  , which also causes  defects in the core and shell interfaces.  \n\nThe most well-known Cd-free QDs, InP QDs, are quite sensitive to oxygen.  The use of thick shells without grain boundaries can protect InP QDs, but implementing this strategy is  challenging. One possible reason is the surface oxidation of InP  QDs during the synthesis process.  The surface oxidation  of InP QDs is mainly due to the water molecules generated  during InP QD synthesis.    $\\mathrm{InP}$   QDs have stronger covalent  bonding compared to II–VI QDs, and a high growth temperature of above   $188~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is required.  At this high temperature,  carboxylic acids, which are widely used in InP QD synthesis,  generate water via the side reaction shown below  \n\n$$\n2\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\right)_{14}\\mathrm{COOH}\\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{In\\,P\\,QDs,\\,300\\,\\,^{\\circ}C}}\\left[\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\right)_{14}\\right)\\right]_{2}\\mathrm{CO}+\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\n$$  \n\nThe amorphous phase of the surface oxide can inhibit epitaxial growth of the   $Z\\mathrm{n}S$   shell, as can the relatively large lattice  mismatch between the surface oxide and   $\\mathrm{ZnS.}^{[24]}$   The lattice  constant of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   is   $10.12\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  , which is very different from that  of   $Z\\mathrm{n}S$   (5.41 Å).  \n\nPerovskite structures have generally the chemical formula   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$  , where “A ” and “B” are cations of different sizes and “X” is  anion. Perovskite QDs can be divided into two types depending  on the material used as cation “A.” The first is the organic– inorganic hybrid type, in which “A ” is an organic substance \n\n (e.g., methyl amine (MA), ethylamine (EA), or form amid in i um \n\n (FA)). The second is the all-inorganic type containing an inorganic cation such as Cs. Pb and Sn are the most common “B”  cations, and halogen anions such as Cl, Br, and I are\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
