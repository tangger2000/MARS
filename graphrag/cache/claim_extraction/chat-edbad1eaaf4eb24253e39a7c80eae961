Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

These results demonstrated  the OIHL pass iv ation strategy conducted by various metal bromides could be used to improve the electro-optic conversion  efficiency of the devices. These devices also showed high reproducibility (Figure 6e,f) with an average peak current efficiency  from 40 devices as high as 61.2, 59.6, 57.4, and 53.7 cd   $\\mathsf{A}^{-1}$   for  LEDs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnBr_{2^{-}}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{MnBr_{2}}\\cdot$  ,   $\\mathrm{InBr}_{3}.$  , and   $\\mathrm{GBaBr}_{3}$  -passivated  QDs. Their corresponding average peak EQE values were  $15.1\\%$  ,   $14.8\\%$  ,   $13.8\\%$  , and   $14.6\\%$  , respectively. These inorganic metal  bromides could enhance device performances by up to   $40\\%$  through the proposed OIHL method. These results demonstrate  the metal-bromide-based OIHL strategy presents a practical  solution to improve the performance of perovskite QLEDs.  \n\nTable 1. â€‚ Summary of the material and device performance parameters  of QDs through OIHL pass iv ation strategy with various metal bromides. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/f9ca6495d5367cc9d122489d693ee993d75cddb05f1c11b90045902d8d35e643-1727122474.jpg)  \na) Luminance here is a maximum value in luminance versus voltage curve;   ${\\mathsf{b}})_{\\mathsf{E Q E}}$  here is a maximum value in EQE versus luminance curve;  c) Current efficiency here  is a maximum value in current efficiency versus luminance curve.  \n\nThe efficiency of perovskite-based LEDs has improved rapidly since the first relevant LED report in 2014.  The present result demonstrates a record for perovskite-based QLEDs  through OIHL pass iv ation, which has met the requirements of  the practical applications. However, device stability is still an  urgent issue warranting exploration in perovskite-based LEDs.  The stability of the QLEDs in this study was tested under a  constant injection current in   $\\Nu_{2}$   (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The luminance decreased gradually, and finally the  devices with a life-time of  ${\\approx}140\\,\\mathrm{min}$   are higher than the device  based on primal QDs (  $(40\\,\\mathrm{\\min})$  ). The devices were thus comparable to the Br-related perovskite with   $100\\ \\mathrm{min}$   stability in  previous report,  even showing a slight improvement.  \n\nFurther improvement of perovskite-based LED stability is  necessary. The ion migration under voltage bias is a major  issue leading to device instability.  Several strategies can be  proposed to improve LED stability such as developing stable  perovskite-emitting materials,  adding suitable molecules to  suppress ion movements,  using effective ligands to reduce  defect sites  and identifying stable carrier injection and transportation layers.  Thus, highly stable perovskite QLEDs are  expected to be developed to suit the requirements of future  practical applications.  \n\nIn summary, we report a generalized and simple OIHL passivation strategy to treat perovskite QDs for high-performance  LEDs. The IR and XPS results showed that organicâ€“inorganic  hybrid ligands were adhered to the QD surface. Importantly,  OIHL pass iv ation contributed to QD films with highly emissive features and effective electrical transportation properties.  The LEDs based on QDs through OIHL with   $Z\\mathrm{nBr}_{2}$   exhibited a  maximum peak EQE of   $16.48\\%$  , which is the highest efficiency  of perovskite-film-based LEDs and QLEDs to this point. Meanwhile, various metal bromides, such as   $\\mathrm{MnBr}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{GaBr}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{InBr}_{3}$  , could feasibly be used to passivate perovskite QDs  through the proposed OIHL strategy to enhance device performance with a nearly   $40\\%$   improvement. The proposed OIHL  pass iv ation strategy for highly efficient LEDs therefore moves  perovskite QD emitters closer to industrialization.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis of Metal-Bromide-Passivated Perovskite   $C s P b B r_{3}$  -Based   $Q D s$  :  For the synthesis of  $Z\\mathsf{n B r}_{2}$  -passivated  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs,  $0.85~\\mathsf{m L}$   of a cesium  precursor (0.1  m    $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   in OTAc) and   $0.15~\\mathrm{{mL}}$   FA precursor   $(0.1~\\mathrm{~M~}$  form amid in e acetate (FA(Ac)) in OTAc) were swiftly added into   $9\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$  of a   $\\mathsf{P b}^{2+}$   solution (0.1  m  $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   and   $0.2~\\mathrm{M}$   tetra oct yl ammonium bromide  (TOAB) in toluene).
