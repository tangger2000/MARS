Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

A spiro-OMeTAD HTL was deposited on  top of the perovskite layers by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   from the  aforementioned solution. Finally, a   $100\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   gold electrode was thermally  deposited in vacuum to complete the devices. The completed devices  were encapsulated using a glass lid and UV-cured sealant. All the film  fabrication and device encapsulation were carried out in nitrogen, except  the spin-coating and annealing of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   in air with a relative humidity of   $\\approx\\!60\\%$  . In the devices, the thicknesses were  $30~\\mathsf{n m}$   for   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  ,   $650~\\mathsf{n m}$   for  the perovskite,   $150~\\mathsf{n m}$   for spiro-OMeTAD, and   $100\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   for Au.  \n\nOptimized PSC Fabrication Conditions : Deposition of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   layer was  conducted in air with a relative humidity below  $30\\%$  . This humidity was  lower than that used for the initial batch and provided higher performing  PSCs. During a deposition of perovskite layer in a nitrogen-filled  glovebox, the glovebox was purged by nitrogen continuously to avoid the  solvent vapor-induced damage to a perovskite film.  \n\nCharacterization :  $J^{-V}$  measurements were performed on PSCs using a  computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source unit under simulated AM1.5G  solar illumination from a Xe lamp-based solar simulator (SRO-25 GD,  Bunkokeiki). The scan rate was   $0.2\\ \\vee\\ s^{-1}$   unless otherwise mentioned.  The active area of the PSCs was defined to be   $3.24~\\mathsf{m m}^{2}$     $(\\mathsf{I}.8\\times\\mathsf{I}.8\\ m m^{2})$    by using a black shadow mask while the original device area defined  by an overlap of the ITO and Au electrodes was   $4\\ m m^{2}$  . Prior to each  measurement, the lamp power was carefully calibrated at   $100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  (1 sun) using a crystalline Si reference cell with an amorphous Si optical  filter (Bunkokeiki), which was certificated by the National Institute of  Advanced Industrial Science and Technology of Japan. For morphological  and structural characterization of fresh and degraded perovskite films,  scotch tape was used to peel off the top metal electrode after carefully  removing the encapsulation glass. Then, chl oro benzene was used to  remove the HTL. Steady-state PL spectra of these perovskite films were  obtained using a JASCO FP-8600 spec tro flu oro meter with a wavelength  range between 600 and   $900\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   with a step of   $0.2\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . The excitation  wavelength was fixed at  $460\\:\\mathsf{n m}$  . XRD patterns of the perovskite films were  evaluated with an XRD system using a typical 2  θ / θ  technique  $[\\lambda=].54\\:\\AA$    (CuK α )] (Rigaku, Ultima IV). SEM images and HR-SEM images of the  perovskite films were taken with a JEOL JCM-5700 and a HITACHI SU8000  system at an acceleration voltage of 5 and   $1~\\mathrm{\\bf~kV}$  with magnifications  of  $\\mathsf{c}_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}{\\times}\\mathsf{\\pi}_{0}\\mathsf{\\pi}_{000}$   and  $\\times\\ 40\\ 000$  , respectively. Quantitative elemental analysis  was performed on the samples with a HITACHI SU8000 SEM-EDS system  equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer.  \n\nDevice Lifetime Measurements : White light from a LED with an  intensity of   $\\bar{1}00\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\circ m^{-2}$   was used to illuminate the PSCs continuously  at  $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .   $V_{0C},J_{S C},$  \n\nusing a lifetime measurement system (System Engineers). In between  scans, PSCs were connected with a  $\\rceil\\ \\lvert\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$   resistor.  \n\nPhotolysis Experiments of   $P b I_{2}$   Neat Film :   $0.5~\\mathrm{~M~}$   of   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   solution in  DMF: DMSO (4:1 vol/vol) was stirred at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $5\\,\\mathsf{h}$  . With this solution,   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   films were spin-coated on the cleaned glass substrates at 4000 rpm  for   $30~s$   and annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The film thicknesses were   $\\approx\\!60\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$  , which was measured by a Dektak pro filo meter.   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   films were  irradiated by UV light for 1, 2, or   $3\\ \\mathsf{h}$  . It was noted that the samples were  put on a hot plate kept at 370 or   $500~\\mathsf{K}$   during the irradiation of UV light.  After irradiation, absorption spectra and XRD patterns of UV-illuminated  and fresh   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   films were measured and compared.  \n\nImpact of Excess   $P b I_{2}$   on Performance of   $M A P b I_{3}$   Based PSCs :   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$  films were prepared from a stoic hio metric solution of   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  : MAI  (1:1 by mol) with a concentration of   $1.2~\\mathrm{M}$   for each chemical. To prepare  precursor solutions with excess   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  , 1.21 or   $1.23~\\mathrm{~M~}$   of   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   was used  while the concentration of MAI was fixed at   $1.2~\\mathrm{M}$  .   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   and MAI were  dissolved in a DMF: DMSO   $(4;1\\ \\mathsf{v o l}/\\mathsf{v o l})$   solvent. These solutions with  the different   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   concentrations were stirred at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   overnight. The  solutions were spin-coated on glass substrates coated with ITO and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   at   $4000\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for 30 s.   $200~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of chl oro benzene was dropped on  the substrate at   $5\\ s$   after the spin program started. After the deposition  of the perovskite layers, the substrates were immediately annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The fabrication conditions for other layers were the  same as those mentioned earlier.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors thank Dr. Watanabe Dori for her instruction and assistance  for HR-SEM and SEM-EDS measurements.
