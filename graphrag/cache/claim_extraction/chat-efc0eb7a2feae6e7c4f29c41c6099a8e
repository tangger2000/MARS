Note that the pH value  of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   solution that was used for the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film deposition  decreased from 9 (alkaline) to 7 (neutral) after RCQs-doping,  which would reduce damage to the ITO substrates from the use  of this alkaline solution in the  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   deposition process.  \n\nTo ascertain whether chemical interactions exist between \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and RCQs, we obtained X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy \n\n (XPS) spectra for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -RCQs films that were  deposited on the ITO substrates.

The scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films in FigureÂ 2a  show the change in the perovskite film morphology induced  by RCQs-doping of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film; the perovskite films were  deposited following exactly the same one-step solution method  for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RCQs and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   films. It is clear that both films  are continuous and pinhole-free, with randomly interconnected  grains. However, most of the grains on  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   are notably  larger than those on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  . This phenomenon can be seen  more clearly in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), where  the measured average grain size of   $\\approx\\!700\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs  is significantly larger than the corresponding value of   ${\\approx}300\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}}$   on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  . The AFM images of the perovskite film  on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   in Figure S3 (Supporting Information) also  exhibit larger domains and smaller RMS values than those on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  , indicating the reduction of defects and surface potential  fluctuations on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   surface.  In Figure S4 (Supporting Information), the contact angle of the perovskite precursor solution deposited on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   is measured as   ${\\approx}20^{\\circ}$  ,  which is clearly smaller than that on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$     $(\\approx\\!40^{\\circ})$  , indicating  a smaller surface energy with increased interface wet t ability  for the perovskite from the carboxylic acid- and hydroxyl-rich  RCQs-doped surface.  Lower Gibbs free energies in heterogeneous nucleation are known to facilitate the perovskite  nucleation process.  Thus, the carboxylic acid- and hydroxylrich RCQs on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   surface can promote perovskite  crystal lin it y and, thus, an increased grain size, as observed by  SEM and AFM, and later by GIXRD. The optical absorption  spectrum (FigureÂ  2b) and the photo luminescence (PL) spectrum (FigureÂ 2c) of the perovskite film grown on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs  further demonstrate higher light absorption and weaker PL  emission than those of the control film, indicating enhanced  photo generated carrier generation with reduced recombination, which will eventually lead to increased photo currents  in the\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
