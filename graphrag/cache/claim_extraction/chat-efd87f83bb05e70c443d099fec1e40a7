Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The as-prepared SFMC is indexed in an ortho rhombi c double  perovskite (PDF#01-080-8394), which partly transforms to Ruddlesden–Popper phase   $\\mathrm{Sr}_{3}\\mathrm{Fe}_{2\\cdot x\\cdot\\gamma}\\mathrm{Mo}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{\\gamma}\\mathrm{O}_{7-\\delta}$   (denote as RPSFMC, PDF#01-075-3655) after reduction,  and the phase  transformation aggravates with prolonging the reduction time.  A CoFe alloy phase could also be observed in the reduced samples, illustrating that Co in conjunction with Fe could be in situ  exsolved from the parent SFMC in alloy form. The exsolution  process is shown in Equation (1).  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{Sr_{2}F e_{1.35}M o_{0.45}C o_{0.2}O_{6-\\delta}}\\!+\\!\\mathrm{H_{2}}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Sr_{3}F e_{2-x-y}M o_{x}C o_{y}O_{7-\\delta}}}\\\\ &{\\quad+\\mathrm{Sr_{2}}\\left(\\mathrm{Fe_{1.35}M o_{0.45}C o_{0.2}}\\right)_{1-z}\\mathrm{O_{6-\\delta}}+\\mathrm{CoFe+H_{2}O}\\!+\\!\\mathrm{V_{0}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\mathrm{Sr}_{2}(\\mathrm{Fe}_{1.35}\\mathrm{Mo}_{0.45}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.2})_{1\\cdot2}\\mathrm{O}_{6-\\delta}$   represents B-site deficient  double perovskite after reduction and before the phase transformation,  $\\mathrm{V_{O}}$   represents the oxygen vacancy.  \n\nHigh-temperature in situ XRD measurement was conducted  on the as-prepared SFMC powder to investigate the redox stability by switching the atmosphere between reduction and  ox i diz ation (Figure  1c). The XRD patterns shift to lower 2 θ values at   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in Ar and during the following reduction process in   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  , indicative of lattice expansion after the loss of lattice oxygen. The phase transformation occurs and aggravates  with prolonging the reduction time. Then, the XRD patterns  shift to higher   $2\\theta$  values in air, accompanied with the phase  transformation back to double perovskite. The peak position  moves slightly to the low angle after complete re-oxidation  (green line), compared to that at room temperature, mainly due  to the loss of lattice oxygen at high temperature. Re-oxidation  serves to heal the disordered region by driving CoFe nanoparticles and oxygen back into the parent perovskite to convert into  the original perovskite (Figure 1d,e). The cyclical in situ XRD  results demonstrate that CoFe alloy exsolution and phase transformation are reversible, indicative of good redox r ever sibi lit y  ( Scheme    1 a). The reversible phase transformation between  SFMC and RP-SFMC with CoFe alloy nanoparticles is also  confirmed within thermodynamic equilibrium (Scheme S1,  Supporting Information).  \n\nPure   $\\mathrm{Sr}_{2}\\mathrm{Fe}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Mo}_{0.5}\\mathrm{O}_{6-\\delta}$   (SFM) is redox stable, with no exsolution of Fe nanoparticles under reducing atmosphere at high  temperature.  In the case of Co-doped SFM, Co cation has a  higher tendency to be exsolved toward the surface than Fe. The calculated segregation energy of Co and Fe with oxygen  vacancies are   $-0.64$   and   $0.91~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively (Scheme 1b). The  introduction of cation defects and oxygen vacancies by Co exsolution could decrease the segregation energy of Fe to   $0.62\\ \\mathrm{eV}$  and thus facilitate Fe exsolution, as obtained by DFT calculations.  We therefore speculate that exsolution phenomenon  origins from oxygen vacancies introduced after   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   annealing,  nucleated metallic Co that is exsolved from the parent perovskite with the generation of cation defects and oxygen vacancies, and then metallic Fe can be exsolved to generate CoFe  alloy nanoparticles. After re-oxidation at   $200–600\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  , CoFe  phase disappears gradually (Figure  1f,g), whereas the layered  perovskite phase remains unchanged, which  illustrates fast  oxidation of CoFe alloy to   $\\mathrm{CoFeO}_{x}$   and sluggish cation dissolution into the perovskite at low temperatures. Figure S1, Sup- porting Information, shows the surface morphology evolution  of SFMC before and after reduction as well as after re-oxidation. The nanoparticles are exsolved directly after reduction.  After re-oxidation, certain flat particles with irregular shape  appear and are attached onto the perovskite surface.  From  XRD and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) results in Figure   $_{1\\mathrm{f,g}}$  and Figure S2c, Supporting Information, we speculate that the  composition of   $\\mathrm{CoFeO}_{x}$  is probably   $\\mathrm{CoFe_{2}O_{4}}$   spinel (PDF#03- 0864). The diffraction peak that ascribed to   $\\mathrm{CoFe_{2}O_{4}}$   has a low  signal-to-noise ratio, mainly due to the low crystal lin it y of the  re-oxidized nanoparticles (Figure S2, Supporting Information).  After re-oxidation at  $800~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , a complete dissolution of the CoFe  alloy nanoparticles into the perovskite occurs (Figure S1h, Supporting Information).  \n\nIn situ TEM has been employed to provide insights at  nanoscale into the exsolution of metallic nanoparticles in  per ovsk ites under reducing atmosphere.

In Figure  2a, CoFe alloy  nanoparticles emerge during the reduction and then vanish  during the oxidation at the same location. The local structure  of the re-oxidized sample is essentially the same as that of the  as-prepared sample, with no aggregation of CoFe alloy nanoparticles. These in situ STEM and ESEM results perfectly matched  the in situ XRD results that the exsolution and phase transformation are reversible.  \n\nFigure  2b shows direct insights into emerging, growing  (circled with a yellow full line), and coarsening (circled with a  yellow dashed line) processes of CoFe alloy nanoparticles under   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   atmosphere. The metal ions may nucleate at a sub-nanometer size on the surface or inside the parent perovskite, and  then migrate to the surface. The exsolution of SFMC is reversible, therefore, we focus on in situ observation of the re-oxidation process, which has seldom been reported in the literatures.
