The hydrothermal method is a synthesis method of crystal materials in hot water or organic solvents under high temperature. The basic principle of hydrothermal method for ZnO synthesis is as follows. A Zn salt and alkali, e.g., KOH or hexamethylene tetramine, are dissolved into the solvent. The Zn2+ and OH- in the solution react with each other to form Zn(OH)2 precipitates. As the reaction proceeds, the temperature and pressure increase, the pH of the solution increases gradually, and the concentration of Zn2+ decreases, which leads to decomposition and dehydration of Zn(OH)2 precipitates. Finally, the Zn(OH)2 precipitates convert into ZnO. Like other solution-based synthesis methods, the morphology and doping of ZnO nanorods can be realized by tuning the composition and concentration of precursor, reaction temperature, and time.)\n##\n(ZnO nanorods<|>PSCs<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>ZnO nanorods are introduced into PSCs by Bi et al. in 2013. They fabricated the PSCs on the basis of experience and knowledge accumulated from traditional DSSCs. In their research, by using MAPbI3 as the sensitizer and combining solid spiro-OMeTAD HTM and ZnO nanorods ETM, they prepared PSCs with the structure of Au/spiro-MeOTAD/MA PbI3/nanorods/seed layer/FTO. The ZnO nanorods were synthesized from the hydrothermal method. Compact ZnO film prepared from ZnO colloids was used as a seed layer for hydrothermal as well as a hole block layer. The obtained ZnO nanorods were vertically aligned on the substrate. The MAPbI3 sensitizer was made from a precursor solution (PbI2:CH3NH3I = 1:1, molar ratio, 40 wt% in n-Bu tyrol act one) by spin coating. After spin coating, the MAPbI3 will penetrate into the space between the nanorods without affecting ZnO nanorods. They studied the relation between the nanorods length and cell performance. It was found that the length of nanorods plays a key role in cell efficiency. To certain extent, with increasing the ZnO nanorods length, the Jsc, FF, Voc, and PCE of solar cells increase but the Voc may decrease. This is mainly because the length of ZnO nanorods determines the electron transport time and lifetime, which will directly affect the performance of solar cells. Although the best PCE they gained is only about 5.0%, the work opens a new direction for the ZnO ETM based PSCs.)\n##\n(ZnO nanorods<|>PSCs<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Similar study has been reported by Son et al. In their research, they fabricated PSCs with the same device structure. Because the morphology and quality of perovskite materials fabricated by the initial one-step coating process cannot be tightly controlled. Perovskite cannot always completely fill and cover the space between the nanorods, and the spiro-OMeTAD can permeate into these unfilled holes and contact with ZnO nanorods, which will form shunt path and deteriorate the performance of solar cells. Therefore, they used a two-step coating method to replace the one-step method used by Bi et al. The cross-sections of PSCs based on ZnO nanorods of different lengths were shown in Figure 5e–g. As can be seen, the two-step coating method produced a fully filled perovskite film that covered all ZnO nanorods of different lengths without voids and formed an overlayer on the nanorods surface. Additionally, the two-step coating procedure optimizes the cuboid size of MAPbI3 and then decreases the series resistance of the PSC, which is favored by solar cells. As a result, combining the two-step coating method with the optimized nanorods length, a best PCE of 11.13% was obtained.)\n##\n(ZnO nanorods<|>PSCs<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Further research on the relation between the nanorods length and solar cell performance was carried out either. The J-V curves, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra together with EQE data-based integrated current density for the PSCs based on ZnO nanorods of different lengths are shown in Figure 5h,i. As can be seen, with the increase of ZnO nanorods length, the PCE, Jsc, and EQE of solar cell increase too, while the Voc decreased. The increase of PCE and Jsc are because longer nanorods increase the charge extraction efficiency and the nanorods also act as scattering centers to increase the light absorption, which is confirmed by the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films on ZnO nanorods of different lengths shown in Figure 5j. The decrease of Voc can be attributed to larger interfacial area induced by increasing nanorods length, which increased the recombination at the same time.)\n##\n(ZnO nanorods<|>PSCs<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Besides the length of nanorods, the seed layer plays an important role in the ZnO nanorods growth and photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. The so-called seed layer is usually a compact ZnO film, which is usually fabricated by solution processes. Generally, there are three kinds of precursor solutions that can be used to fabricate ZnO seed layers. The precursor solutions can be zinc salt solution, ZnO colloids, or ZnO nanoparticle solution. Son et al. systematically deposited three different ZnO seed layers based on each precursor solution and studied the influence of ZnO nanorods growth and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. According to their results, the seed layer can affect the properties of ZnO nanorods. Seed layer produced from the colloid solution can fully cover the substrate, and however, the seed layer made from the zinc salt solution or ZnO nanoparticle solution does not provide a full coverage. The poor coverage of ZnO films tends to form shut paths. ZnO nanorods grown on a colloid seed layer showed not only a good coverage but also enhanced transmittance over the range of visible wavelengths. The shunts caused by the poor coverage decrease the Voc and photo current density, as shown in Figure 5kJ. In addition, recombination at the perovskite/ZnO interface was suppressed for the cell using the seed layer prepared by the colloid solution. This work directly proved the important role of the seed layers for the ZnO nanorods based PSCs.)\n##\n(ZnO nanorods<|>PSCs<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>On the other hand, considering the unique structure and morphology of ZnO nanorods)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt\n\n## Target Activity\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.\n\n## Goal\nGiven a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n## Steps\n1.

As a  result, in order to reduce the severe recombination, 1D   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nano structures were used to replace nano particle films. Unlike  nanoparticles, the 1D ZnO nano structure usually is single  crystal and provides a direct pathway for electron transport.
