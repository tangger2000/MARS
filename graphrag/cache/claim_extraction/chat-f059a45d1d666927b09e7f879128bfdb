Encapsulation techniques can slow down  the degradation process, but the essential approach to tackle this issue is to  find stable perovskite materials capable  of achieving long-term stability.  In  contrast to traditional 3D counterparts,  quasi-2D layered per ovsk ites have shown  enhanced stability owing to the bulkier  and hydrophobic organic molecule in  the structure, and have been applied  both in photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes.  Quasi-2D per ovsk ites  take the generic structural formula of   $\\mathrm{L}_{2}\\mathrm{S}_{n-1}\\mathrm{M}_{n}\\mathrm{X}_{3n+1},$  , where   $n$   is an integer, M is  a divalent metal, X is a halide anion, and  L and S are organic cations with large and  small sizes, respectively.  Layered structures are usually formed by inserting the  large-sized organic cation spacers into the  inorganic sheets of corner-sharing   $[\\mathrm{MX}_{6}]$    octahedra. These quasi-2D compounds  \n\nQuasi-2D layered organo metal halide per ovsk ites have recently emerged  as promising candidates for solar cells, because of their intrinsic stability  compared to 3D analogs. However, relatively low power conversion efficiency  (PCE) limits the application of 2D layered per ovsk ites in photovoltaics, due  to large energy band gap, high exciton binding energy, and poor interlayer  charge transport. Here, efficient and water-stable quasi-2D perovskite solar  cells with a peak PCE of   $\\mathbf{18.20\\%}$   by using 3-b romo benz yl ammonium iodide  are demonstrated.

The robust performance of perovskite solar cells results from the quasi2D perovskite films with hydrophobic nature and a high degree of electronic  order and high crystal lin it y, which consists of both ordered large-bandgap  per ovsk ites with the vertical growth in the bottom region and oriented smallbandgap components in the top region.

In addition, a remarkable  PCE of   $17.4\\%$   has been achieved by using benz yl ammonium  for layered per ovsk ites   $(n=9)$  .  Although quasi-2D layered  per ovsk ites have shown promising stability against moisture,  a few challenges need to be addressed in order to achieve high  efficiency solar cells, such as poor interlayer charge transport,  large energy band gap and high exciton binding energy.   Two main strategies have been developed to enhance the  device performance of quasi-2D perovskite solar cells.   One is increasing the number ( n  value) of inorganic sheets  between two adjacent organic spacers, although this approach  sacrifices stability to some extent.  The other approach is  tuning of the crystal growth orientation perpendicular to the  substrate to achieve rapid charge transport, however the efficiency is still much lower than that of their 3D counterparts  due to the narrower absorption across the solar spectrum and  higher exciton binding energy.  \n\nHerein, we demonstrate efficient and water-stable perovskite  solar cells with a peak PCE of   $18.20\\%$   by using 3-bromobenzy l ammonium iodide (3BBAI) based quasi-2D per ovsk ites  with good moisture resistance due to its hydrophobic nature.  The excellent performance of solar cells stems from the robust  quasi-2D perovskite films with high crystal lin it y and order.  Moreover, due to the suppressed non radiative recombination,  the solar cell can be operated as a light-emitting diode (LED),  which shows an external quantum efficiency of   $3.85\\%$   with  better stability than near-infrared organic LEDs.  \n\nThe devices were fabricated in the inverted planer configuration:  indium  tin  oxide  (ITO)/Poly[bis(4-phenyl)­\n\n (2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)amine]  (PTAA,   $30\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~\\textrm~{~\\,~}~}}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{nm}})$  nm)/perovskite \n\n (  $350\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  )/[6,6]-phenyl $\\cdot C_{61}$  -butyric acid methyl ester   $(\\mathrm{PC}_{61}\\mathrm{BM}$  ,   $100\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  )/chromium (Cr, 3  nm)/gold (Au,   $100\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ), as shown  in  Figure   1 a. The energy-level diagram is shown in Figure 1b,  wherein the energy level values for perovskite and PTAA were  obtained from the previous reports.  In this device structure, PTAA acts as the hole extraction layer and   $\\mathrm{PC}_{\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
