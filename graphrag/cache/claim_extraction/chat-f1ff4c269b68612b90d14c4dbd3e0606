Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

No obvious peak shifts for all the  elements of perovskite were observed.

The cell without the dye interlayer showed an  average PCE of   ${\\approx}2.29\\%$   based on the scans of reverse and  forward directions, which was reasonably compared with the  literature results, while the cell with the N719 dye interlayer  showed an average PCE of   ${\\approx}2.77\\%$  , which was about   $21\\%$  improved as compared to the former. Such improvement in  the PCE was a result of the increased   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  . To ensure  that such improvement is a universal feature, for each type of  cells (with or without the dye interlayer), twenty cells were fabricated and tested, and the PCE distribution for both types of  cells was given in FigureÂ 2b. It shows that the average PCE of  the PSCs with the N719 dye interlayer was improved obviously  as compared to the dye-free ones. Moreover, we compared the  reported PCEs of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  -based PSCs in the literature with  our current results as shown in FigureÂ  2c.  The PCE of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  -based PSCs with N719 dye interlayer in this work  performs better than most of the available   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$  -based  devices. FigureÂ  2d presents the steady-state PCE and current  density of the modified device at a constant voltage on the maximum power output points under sunlight illumination. The  dye-incorporated cell demonstrated a stable PCE of   $2.70\\%$   at a  voltage of   $0.73\\,\\mathrm{\\:V.}$   FigureÂ 2e shows that the integrated current  density obtained with external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were 4.33 and  $5.21\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   respectively for the cells  without and with the N719 interlayer, which are consistent with  the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   (4.49 and  $5.13\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ) from  $J{-}V$  measurements shown  in FigureÂ 2a. Moreover, it was found that the absorption wavelength ending point of the EQE spectrum was broadened from  550 to  $680\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   with the introduction of the N719 dye interlayer.  \n\nIt is well known that the PCE of a PSC is determined by  many factors such as the sunlight absorption capability, energy  level alignment of different layers, photo-generated carrier  transport properties, and recombination behavior as well as the  defect density. The broadened absorption wavelength ending  point of EQE spectrum suggests the additional light absorption capability of the N719 dye, which was also confirmed  by the absorption profiles of the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$   films with and  without the N719 dye interlayer (FigureÂ  2f). The   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$  exhibited a sharp absorption peak at about   $438~\\mathrm{nm}$   and a weak  tailing absorption edge at around   $610\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   due to the indirect  band gap property of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  , which led to the lower  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of  the devices. After the introduction of the N719 dye interlayer,  the sunlight absorption intensity was enhanced obviously. We  also measured the absorption capability of pure N719 film as  shown in FigureÂ S8, Supporting Information, a much broader  adsorption wavelength was found as compared to the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g\\cdot}$   $\\mathrm{BiBr_{6}}$   perovskite. Therefore, the improvement of   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and PCE  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}/\\mathrm{N}719$   film-based PSCs was partially due to the  contribution of additional sunlight absorption of the N719 dye.  \n\nIt is well known that a proper energy level alignment of the  different layers in PSC is critical to accelerate the hole extraction  process, which will then enhance the PCE of PSC.  FigureÂ 1b  displays the energy band diagrams of the different layers in the  dye-modified PSC. Here, the position of Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$   and  valence band maximum   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}\\right)$   of the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  film was determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement as shown in FigureÂ  S9, Supporting  Information, which was turned out to be   $-4.08$   and   $-6.13\\,\\mathrm{\\eV},$  respectively. FigureÂ  S10, Supporting Information shows the  Tauc plot of the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$   film from which phonon assisted  energies of 1.74 and   $2.30~\\mathrm{eV}$   were determined. Therefore, the  indirect band gap of the prepared   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$   film in this study  was   $2.02~\\mathrm{eV}$   (an average of the phonon assisted energies). The  position of conduction band minimum   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}\\right)$   of   $-4.11$  eV  was then calculated according to the relationship: band   $\\mathtt{g a p=}$   $E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}~-~E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}$  . The energy band structures of other materials  were obtained from the literature.  It was found the energy  band structure between   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$   (  $.E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}$  ,   $E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}$  :   $-6.13$  ,   $-4.11$  eV) and Spiro-OMeTAD   $(E_{\\mathrm{VBM}},\\,E_{\\mathrm{CBM}};-5.20,-2.20\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   was mis- matched, which will hinder the hole extraction process in PSCs.  The N719 dye is a conventional sunlight absorbing material in  dye-sensitized solar cells with the   $E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}$   of   $\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
