Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The  coupled sample shows excellent HER activities as compared to  pristine NiFe LDH-NS (barely HER activity) (Figure 2d). The  measured over potentials at the current density of   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$    for the NiFe LDH-NS  $@$  DG10, NiFe   $\\mathrm{LDH-NS@N G}10$  , and  NiFe LDH-NS@G10 are 300, 360, and   $440\\ \\mathrm{mV},$   respectively.  The NiFe LDH-NS  $(@D G10$   also exhibits a smaller Tafel slope  of   $110~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1}$   in the linear region (Figure 2e), which represents a fast reaction kinetics. When NiFe LDH-NS  $\\cdot@D G10$   is  supported on Ni foam with a loading of   $2\\;\\mathrm{mg}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , it presents  a small over potential of only   $115~\\mathrm{mV}$   to reach a current density of  $20\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$   (Figure S8, Supporting Information). It is  noteworthy that there are few reports about LDH based catalysts possessing such a favorable HER activity, even comparable to transition metal chal co geni des and phosphides based  catalysts reported to date in basic media (Table S2, Supporting  Information). The durability is excellent, as can be seen from  Figure 2f, the HER activity keeps almost unchanged after 8000  cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan. We also carried out  the chrono am pero metric test for the NiFe LDH $\\mathrm{NS}@\\mathrm{DG}10$   at  an over potential of   $300\\ \\mathrm{mV}$   as seen in Figure 2f, inset. It is  evident that the current density is nearly constant during the  continuous operation for 20,000 s. The Faradaic efficiency is   $97.3\\%$   after   $5\\mathrm{~h~}$   chrono am pero metric test at a cathode current  density of   $100\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (see details in the Supporting Information). The TEM image of NiFe LDH-NS  $(@D G10$   collected  after the chrono am pero metric test (Figure S9b, Supporting  Information) shows the robust stability of NiFe LDH-NS  $@$  DG10 in HER. The excellent catalytic HER activity and durability of NiFe LDH $\\mathrm{NS}@\\mathrm{DG}$   may result from the following factors: (i) as compared to NG or G, defective sites on DG provide  more efficient anchor sites to directly couple transition metal  atoms (Ni and Fe) on 2D exfoliated NiFe LDH nanolayers;  (ii) variable inter facial interaction between 3d transition metal  atoms and defects on carbon significantly enhances density of  electron transfer at specific domains; (iii) the incorporation of  DG prevents the aggregation of exfoliated LDH nanosheets,  leading to enlarged and stable electrochemical active surface  area.  \n\nIn our previous study, defects on graphene were confirmed  to be functional as the catalytic active sites for HER, leading to  an extremely high activity among the metal free catalysts.  On  the other hand, the exfoliated Ni–Fe LDH nanosheet was recognized as the ideal catalyst for OER.  Based on experimental  results aforementioned, both the HER and OER activities are  further enhanced after coupling of DG and Ni–Fe LDH-NS,  indicating the synergistic effect may play a vital role in HER  and OER. Considering HER and OER are the two half reactions  of overall water splitting, which are described as  \n\n$2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+2\\mathrm{e}^{-}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{H}_{2}+2\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$  ( HER in alkaline electrolyte )  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{4OH^{-}\\rightarrow O_{2}+2H_{2}O+4e^{-}\\left(O E R\\ i n\\ a l k a l i n e\\ e l e c t r o l y t e\\right)}\n$$  \n\nNaturally, we supposed that the charge transfer between DG  and Ni–Fe LDH-NS can efficiently enhance the HER and OER,  which is conducted by each components. To investigate the  charge distributions on this he t ero structure, we undertook a  series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Green, brown, silver, and red balls represent C, Fe, Ni, and  O atoms, respectively. The different defect types and associated enhanced charge density areas are marked with a blue solid line and a blue dash line,  respectively. c) The schematic of the probable electro catalytic mechanism of Ni–Fe LDH-NS  $@$  DG for HER and OER is presented based on the DFT  calculation results. The pink and purple spheres represent electrons and holes, respectively.  \n\nshows the geometries of the fully relaxed Ni–Fe LDH-NS  $@$  DG  (DG-5, DG-585 or DG-5775) in top view and their charge density  differences are shown in side view (Figures 3b). It can be seen  apparently that the electrons are redistributed after assembling  the DG and Ni–Fe LDH-NS together, especially around the  defect sites marked with blue dash frames in Figure 3b. Electron transfer from Ni–Fe LDH-NS to graphene was observed  in DG in contrast to negligible in G and NG (Figure S10, Supporting Information), revealing the electron accumulation at  the defect sites in DG.  \n\nHere, the localized electrons accumulation at the defect sites  is supposed to enhance the HER. On the other hand, the electron transfer results in the holes accumulation on Ni–Fe LDHNS, which is favor to OER. To be concluded, the hybrid of DG  and Ni–Fe LDH-NS leads to the separation and redistribution  of electrons and holes on DG and Ni–Fe LDH-NS, respectively.  The high density of electrons on DG facilitates HER, while  the high density of holes on Ni–Fe LDH-NS improves the  OER performance, as illustrated in Figure 3c. Noticeably, the  NiFe LDH ${\\mathrm{NS}}@G10$   catalyst shows a lower activity to   $\\mathrm{HER}/$  OER, which may be attributed to the lower density of defects  in G. The defect densities for pristine and defective graphene  are   $2.5\\,\\times\\,10^{12}$   and   $3.4\\,\\times\\,10^{12}\\,\\,\\mathrm{{cm}}^{-2}$  , respectively (the calculation details are provided in the Supporting Information). The  high defect density of the defective graphene supplies more  active sites in NiFe LDH-N  $\\mathrm{S}@\\mathrm{D}G10$  , thus exhibits higher  activity in HER/OER. This defect mechanism  was also  supported by recent publications in etched metal oxide based  systems.  \n\nInspired by the promising half-cell performance in OER  and HER, the NiFe LDH  $\\mathrm{-NS@D G}10$   hybrid material was  used as a bi functional catalyst to evaluate its performance  in a prototype electrolytic cell at room temperature. Impressively, the overall water splitting performance of NiFe  LD  $\\bullet_{\\mathrm{H}\\cdot\\mathrm{NS}@\\mathrm{DG}10}$   bi functional catalyst exhibits more superior  electrolytic rate than NiFe LDH-NS  $@$  graphene (NG and G)  catalysts ( Figure   4 a, inset). It is also noteworthy that higher  loading for NiFe LDH $\\cdot\\mathrm{NS}@\\mathrm{DG}10$     $(2\\,\\mathrm{\\mg\\cm^{-2}})$  ) results in a  better performance for overall water splitting performance  with a current density of   $20\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
