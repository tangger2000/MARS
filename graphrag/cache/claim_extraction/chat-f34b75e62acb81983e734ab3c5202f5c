In pristine perovskite, the PB of n=3 phase shows a fast decay time with τ1 of 1.31 ps (Figure 2e). The PB formation time of n≥4 phase is 1.63 ps within the timescale of the fast decay time of n=3 phase, indicating a fast carrier transfer process. Differently, the PB of n=3 for pristine/ABA perovskites show a smaller τ1 of 0.67 ps (Figure 2f), which is nearly half of that in pristine perovskite (1.31 ps), implying more efficient carrier transfer from n=3 phase to n≥4 phase in pristine/ABA perovskites. Besides, the higher efficient carrier transfer is verified by the faster formation time constant (τet, 0.95 ps) of n≥4 phase for pristine/ABA perovskites, which is less than that of pristine perovskites (1.63 ps). Consequently, we observe the fast photogenerated carrier transfer from the low-order phase to the high-order phase in the quasi-2D perovskite, and demonstrate that pristine/ABA perovskites show more efficient carrier transfer from n=3 phase to n≥4 phase than that of the pristine perovskite, which is vital to obtain highly performed PeLEDs as discussed in the following part. Besides the efficient energy transfer in pristine/ABA perovskite films, there is an enhanced PL intensity for pristine/ ABA perovskite films as observed in Figure 2b, consistent with this trend, a dramatic increase of PLQY from 45.5% (pristine) to 63.5% (pristine/ABA) is found (see Figure S7, Supporting Information), indicating a large reduction of non radiative recombination. We further performed time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements to investigate the effect of ABA on the perovskite film carrier lifetime. The TRPL decay curves are shown in Figure 3 a, which can be fitted by a bi exponential function of I Ω(t)=I0+a1exp(-t/τ1)+a2exp(-t/τ2), where a1, a2 are the amplitudes; τ1, τ2 represent time constants for fast and slow decay lifetimes. The fast time constant is related to nonradiative recombination of the traps, and the slow time associates with the radiative recombination. The fitted parameters for TRPL decay curves are extracted in Table S3 (Supporting Information). It is revealed that both the fast and slow decay lifetimes for pristine/ABA perovskite film of 3.62 and 19.63 ns are much longer than that of pristine perovskite film (τ1, 3.08 ns and τ2, 12.82 ns), which promotes the average fluorescence lifetime of pristine/ABA perovskite (τav=6.10 ns) 1.5-fold higher than the pristine perovskite (τav=3.99 ns). The PL and TRPL results show that the incorporation of ABA can effectively passivate trap states and improve the radiative recombination in the perovskite films, which is consistent with the result of the metallic Pb suppression by ABA incorporation as shown in Figure 1e. To further verify the effect of ABA on defect density of perovskite films, the space charge limited current (SCLC) is performed (Figure 3b,c). The current–voltage (J-V) curves of the devices were measured under dark condition with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite /MoO3/Ag. The trap state density of the perovskite film can be calculated by the equation of N=(2VTFLεrε0)/(e L2), where VTFL is trap-filled limiting voltage, L is the thickness of the film, e represents the electron charge, εr and ε0 are the dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity, respectively. Generally, the lower value of VTEF indicates the less concentration of trap states in the films. In order to determine the trap state density, the value of εr is estimated by the equation of εr=(CL)/(ε0S), where the geometrical capacitance of C can be determined from the C-V curves (Figure S8, Supporting Information), as reported previously. As expected, the trap state density for pristine/ABA perovskite film is notably reduced to 2.01×1017 cm-3 from 4.22×1017 cm-3 (pristine perovskite film), which further confirms the effective passivation of ABA. Besides, we also extract the trap density of states (t DOS) of pristine and pristine/ABA perovskites from capacitance versus frequency measurement, in which the device structure of ITO/PVK/perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al was adopted according to the previous reports. As shown in Figure 3e, the pristine/ABA perovskite shows much lower t DOS that that of pristine perovskite over the entire energy range, indicating the less trap density after ABA incorporation, which is in good agreement with the results of TRPL and SCLC measurements. We have also fabricated the PeLEDs to evaluate their EL performances. The PeLEDs are configured with a structure of ITO/ PVK/perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al, where the perovskite is the emission layer, PVK and TPBi are the hole injection layer (HIL) and electron injection layer (EIL), respectively. The energy bands of pristine and pristine/ABA perovskite films were confirmed by the energy diagram of each layer in PeLEDs, the cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of PeLEDs, the density–luminance–voltage (J-L-V), efficiency–current density (EQE-J), and efficiency–luminance (EQE – L) curves.
