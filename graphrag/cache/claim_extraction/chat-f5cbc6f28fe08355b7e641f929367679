Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The precursor films  gradually converted into a perovskite phase consisting of homogeneously inter mixing of Br and I in the lattice, reducing Sn  vacancies and I vacancies in the grain boundary at the hightemperature annealing due to the Br rich to the grain boundary.  Although the introduction of Br led to a higher bandgap and  thus a decreased  ${\\cal J}_{\\mathrm{sc}},$  , the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of cells was significantly improved  due to the incorporation of Br.  \n\nIncorporation of Cl can enlarge the grain size, functional ize  grain boundaries, and reduce electronic disorder, consequently  improving the efficiency of solar cells. Perovskite films with  large grain sizes and high crystal lin it y were obtained through  the introduction of Cl, while the grain boundaries were passivated by the excess Cl ions. SEM image of perovskite films  with Cl incorporation is shown in  Figure    7 a. Compared with  the reference film, the film with Cl is more uniform. Moreover,  Cl incorporation enables higher charge mobility according to  transient photo current characterization. The best efficiency of  the   $2.5\\%$   Cl-incorporated PSC is   $18.4\\%$  , with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $0.85~\\mathrm{V},$   a  fill factor (FF) of   $74.4\\%$  , and a  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of  $29.31\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  .  \n\n# 3.4.2. SCN Series  \n\nSimilar to the strategy of halide doping, the addition of   $\\mathrm{SCN^{-}}$  salts can also improve the performance, e.g., adding lead thiocyanate   $\\left(\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{SCN})_{2}\\right)$  , methyl ammonium th io cyan ate (MASCN),  and guan id in i um th io cyan ate (GuaSCN). The Yanfa Yan  group studied the effects of   $\\mathrm{Pb(SCN)_{2}}$   in mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide  PSCs.  Using the composition of   $(\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3})_{0.6}(\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3})_{0.4}$  , the  researchers obtained excellent performance by mixing   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   perovskite precursor solutions (6:4) in 2016. The  best efficiency was   $15.08\\%$  , with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $0.799\\;\\mathrm{~V},$  , an FF of   $70.6\\%$  , and a  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $26.86~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . By introducing   $\\mathrm{Pb(SCN)}_{2}$  into the precursor solution, the researchers obtained perovskite films with higher quality. The grains of the film without \n\n  $\\mathrm{Pb(SCN)}_{2}$   were small and chaotic, while those of the film with \n\n  $\\mathrm{Pb(SCN)}_{2}$   were large and uniform. Larger grains were beneficial  to the performance as they reduce grain boundary scattering,  extend the carrier lifetime, and improve the crystal quality.  The best efficiency of   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide PSCs with   $\\mathrm{Pb(SCN)}_{2}$   was  improved to  $17.6\\%$  , with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $0.854~\\mathrm{V},$   an FF of  $71.4\\%$  , and a   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of  $28.7\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  .
