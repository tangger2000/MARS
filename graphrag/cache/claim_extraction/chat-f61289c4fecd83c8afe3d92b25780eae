Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The control and optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films are  n-type semiconductors (Fermi levels are close to the conduction bands). The energy difference between the valence bands  of the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film and Spiro-OMeTAD is remarkably smaller than that of the control film, which means that  the energy loss for hole transfer from the valence band of the  perovskite to Spiro-OMeTAD is smaller. The Fermi level of  the optimized perovskite film is raised from   $-3.68$   to  $-3.55~\\mathrm{eV}$  with the addition of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   and moves closer to the conduction  band   $(-3.53\\mathrm{~}\\mathrm{eV})$  , which indicates a more n-type nature for the  optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film. Therefore, the built-in electric field  between the n-type perovskite and p-type Spiro-OMeTAD will  be increased, giving rise to a higher driving force for photogenerated carrier separation and leading to higher   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   for   $C s P$  -  $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs.  To elucidate the substantial up-shifted Fermi  level of the perovskite film upon the addition of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  , the UPS  of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   was measured, and the bandgap structures of the control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   are shown in Figure S11 in the Supporting Information. The   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   has a much higher Fermi level  than the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br},$  , and when   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   is contact with   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br};$  the excess electrons in the  $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   would diffuse to the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  to increase its Fermi level. Therefore, the   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   can provide  heavy n-type doping in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite.  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  -doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}/$  Spiro-OMeTAD heterojunc- tion exhibits a more desirable band structure for efficient  hole extraction and transfer, which contributes to the higher  built-in potential and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of the ultimate   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs.  To further investigate the improved built-in potential   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{bi}}\\right)$  between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and Spiro-OMeTAD, capacitance–voltage   $(C{-}V)$   measurements are performed. Figure  3e presents the   $1/C^{2}{\\cdot}V$  plots for the control and optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs, and  the   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   is obtained according to the Mott–Schottky equation:   $1/{\\mathrm{C}}^{2}=2(V_{\\mathrm{bi}}{\\cdot}V)/{\\mathrm{A}}^{2}\\mathrm{e}\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon N_{\\mathrm{A}},^{[36,37]}$   where   $V$   is the applied voltage,   $e$   is the electron charge,   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity,   $\\varepsilon$  is the  relative dielectric constant of the inorganic perovskite, and   $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$  is the carrier concentration. The   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   for the optimized  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  was estimated to be   $1.22\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , which is higher than that of the  control device (1.17 V), following a trend similar to that of the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   values obtained from the   $J{-}V$  curves. The relatively higher   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   implies an enhanced driving force for charge separation and  an extended depletion region for suppressing carrier recombination,  which could be the major reason for the improved   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$  .  \n\nFurther, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  measurements are performed to provide insight into the  charge carrier recombination in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PSCs, and the  corresponding Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit model  are presented in Figure 3f;  the fitting parameters are listed  in Table S4 in the Supporting Information. It is found that  the optimized devices exhibit lower series resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$   and  much higher recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$   than the control device.  These results are thus supportive of markedly  reduced carrier recombination in the optimized device, which  is consistent with PL results. Therefore, the above   $C{-}V$  and EIS  characterizations confirm that   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive can effectively  passivate the trap states in the perovskite films and promote  the transport of charge carriers, consequently resulting in high  photovoltaic performance.  \n\nIn order to confirm the existence of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   and understand  the interaction between   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br};$  , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are undertaken. The  high-resolution XPS spectra for various elements (Cs 3d, Pb 4f,  I 3d, and Br 3d) in the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films are shown in  Figure    $\\mathtt{4a-d}$  ,  respectively. Notably, the peak positions of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 3d,  and Br 3d show negligible shifts with   $0.5\\%$   and   $1\\%~\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$    additive, which further rules out the possibility of   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$    entering the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   crystal lattice. Peaks of the   $\\mathrm{Ca}~2\\mathrm{p}$   and  Cl   $2\\mathrm{p}$   orbitals can be detected at   $\\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$   additive concentrations  of   $0.5\\%$   and   $1\\%$  , as shown in Figure 4e,f.
