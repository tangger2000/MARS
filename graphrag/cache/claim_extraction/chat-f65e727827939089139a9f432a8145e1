Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots.

A  $450\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  laser was used to excite samples, which was placed on a piezo-crystalcontrolled scanning stage.  \n\nX-Ray Detection : The used   $\\mathsf X$  -ray source is a soft-X-ray beamline in  Australia Synchrotron. The energy range is about 100â€“2500 eV, which  is suitable for study the   $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray detecting properties of the perovskite  as the X-ray radiation is effectively absorbed inside the   $600\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m}$  film. The dose rate was measured by a portable Radiation Monitor  Controller (Radcal Corporation Model 9010). The effective area can  refer to the focal spot size at the sample which is about   $0.0006\\ {\\mathsf{c m}}^{2}$  The device with two copper wires was mounted on the sample holder  with a glass slide as an insulation in between. The wires were linked  with two pinholes on the sample holder, which have dedicated  electrical contact to export the current to the Keithley source meter  (2400 series) for the current/voltage measurement. The current vs.  voltage and current vs. time were recorded by Quick IV measurement  software.  \n\nFor the hard-X-ray-detection measurements in the X-ray platform,  the used   $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray source is the Bruker D8 discover diffract o meter with   $\\textsf{C u}\\,K\\alpha$  Radiation   $(8~\\mathsf{k e V})$   runs at   $40~\\mathrm{kV}$   and  $40~\\mathsf{m A}$  .

In  the measurement, the dose rates of the X-ray source were changed by  changing the voltage   $(40{-}20~\\mathrm{kV})$   and current   $(40{-}10\\ \\mathsf{m A})$   of the   $\\textsf{C u}\\,K\\alpha$  Radiation source. The dose rate was measured by the Radiation Monitor  Controller.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nJ.L. and B.S. contributed equally to this work.
