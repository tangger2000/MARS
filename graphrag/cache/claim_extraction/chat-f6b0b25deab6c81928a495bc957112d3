Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The energy  dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping of   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   presents a uniform distribu- tion of Pb and I on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  particles and a  more nonuniform distribution of O (the first  three panels of Figure 1d). The oxygen distribution occurs in the region of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   covered with a rGO sheet (the SEM image in the  fourth panel of Figure 1d). This suggests the  bonding between rGO and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   through  the residual oxygen-containing groups and is  consistent with the FTIR results. The UV–vis  diffuse reflectance spectra of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   (Figure S5, Supporting Information) show that both absorb the visible  light, and the absorption edge of   $\\mathrm{\\small{MA}\\mathrm{bl}_{3}/}$   $\\mathrm{r}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{O}$   is blue shifted by   ${\\approx}15\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   with respect  to that of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   reflecting the introduction of rGO to   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  . These results sug- gest that GO is photo reduced to rGO and is  \n\nwell as a more discernible 2D peak around   $2650~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   after  the photo reaction. The D (“disordered”) peak arises from the  breathing modes of the  $\\operatorname{sp}^{2}\\mathbf{C}$   atoms in the rings and the defects  in graphite structures and the G (“graphite-like”) peak from the  bond stretching of all pairs of   $\\operatorname{sp}^{2}\\mathbf{C}$   atoms.  The increase in  the   $I_{\\mathrm{D}}/I_{\\mathrm{G}}$   ratio indicates a decrease in the average number of   $\\operatorname{sp}\\!\\mathrm{^2C}$   atoms or an increase in the structural defects, and hence  an increased degree of GO reduction.  The X-ray diffraction  (XRD) patterns of   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}/\\mathrm{rGC}$   (Figure S3, Supporting Information) reveal that both samples have tetragonal  structures with good crystal lin it y. Scanning electron microscope \n\n (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of \n\n  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and  $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   are presented in  Figure   1  and Figure S4 \n\n (Supporting Information). The   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   particles (of   $45~\\ensuremath{\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$    in average size) have relatively smooth surfaces (Figure S4a,  Supporting Information), which become rougher after the  photo reaction due to the attached rGO sheets (Figure 1a).  The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) picture of Figure 1b shows  distinctly different lattice fringes of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   (Figure S4b, Supporting Information) and rGO (Figure S4c,d, Supporting Information), revealing the formation of  $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   after the photo­ reaction.  The reduction of GO to rGO and the attachment of  the latter to  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   are further confirmed by their Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectra (Figure 1c). The FTIR spectrum of GO  shows the stretching and bending vibrations of various oxygencontaining groups, e.g., epoxy or alkoxy   $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$     $\\scriptstyle(\\approx1060\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ),  epoxide   $_{\\mathsf{C-O-C}}$   or phenolic   $_{\\mathrm{C-O-H}}$     $(\\approx\\!1230\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ), alcoholic   $_{\\mathrm{C-OH}}$     $(\\approx\\!1400\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  , water   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   and   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$     $(\\approx\\!1623\\ \\mathrm{\\cm^{-1}})$  ,  carboxyl ate or ketone   $\\mathrm{C=O}$     $(\\approx\\!1731\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ), as well as a broad  absorption across   $3600{-}2500~\\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$   corresponding to   $\\mathrm{-O-H}$    stretching from the surface hydroxyl groups.  All these  absorption s are weakened or vanish after the photo reaction.  The noticeable absorption band of   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   at   $\\mathord{\\approx}1640$     $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   can be assigned to the skeletal vibration of the graphene  \n\nbonded to the surface of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   particles. The latter point is  further probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The  high-resolution C 1s peaks of GO and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   are presented in  Figure   2 a,b, respectively. GO exhibits strong peaks of   $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$   at   $286.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   and   $\\mathsf{C-C}/\\mathsf{C}{=}\\mathsf{C}$   at   $284.6~\\mathrm{eV}$   as well as weak  peaks of   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   at  $287.7~\\mathrm{eV}$   and  $\\mathrm{O-C=O}$   at   $289.1\\ \\mathrm{eV}.$   The peaks  of three oxygen-containing groups are strongly weakened after  the photo reaction, while the peak of the   $\\mathsf{C-C}/\\mathsf{C}{=}\\mathsf{C}$   bonds  becomes dominant. The peak at   $285.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   is associated with the  formation of a Pb-O-C linkage, and the corresponding changes  are also found in the Pb 4f peak at   $143.6~\\mathrm{eV}$  (Figure 2c) and  the O 1s peak at   $533.6~\\mathrm{eV}$   (Figure 2d). These features strongly  suggest the formation of chemical bonds between   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$    particles and rGO sheets. In addition, there occur a shift of   ${\\approx}0.4~\\mathrm{eV}$   toward a higher binding energy in the Pb 4f peak and  an opposite shift toward a lower binding energy in the O 1s peak  after the photo reaction (Figure 2d). These are attributed to the  fact that rGO is bonded with   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   and the extent of   $\\pi$  conjugation becomes stronger in rGO than in GO. Thus, the  photo reaction of GO to rGO is accompanied by the bonding of  rGO to  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  , changing the surface energy states of   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   and O.  \n\nWe evaluate the photo catalytic   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  evolution reactions using  powder samples of pristine   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and as-prepared   $\\mathrm{\\small{MA}\\mathrm{bl}_{3}/}$  rGO in aqueous HI solution saturated with   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  .
