Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The EIS curves are composed of a semicircle, which can be fitted according to the equivalent circuit model (inset in Figure S9b, Supporting Information).  The   $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$   and  $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$   represent the series resistance and charge transfer  resistance, respectively. As shown in Table S3 (Supporting Information), both films exhibit similar   $R_{s}{\\mathrm{.}}$  , suggesting that the effect  of the series resistance is negligible. While much smaller   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$  in the BVO-1.5h film indicates the better charge transfer property,  resulting in higher photo current densities.  \n\nIn addition, the enhanced photo current densities in the  2-BVO-1.5h dual photo anodes are attributed to the better  light utilization in the wavelength range of   $400{-}520~\\mathrm{~nm}$  (Figure 2b,c).  To further understand the contribution of  the back BVO-1.5h film in the 2-BVO-1.5h dual photo anodes,  the photo current density versus applied potential curve and  the IPCE curve of the BVO-1.5h film filtered by another BVO $1.5\\mathrm{h}$   film were also measured. As shown in Figure S10a (Supporting Information), the BVO-1.5h film can still generate a  photo current density of around   $0.80~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at   $1.23\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus  RHE when located behind another BVO-1.5h film, which is  mainly converted from the light at   $400{-}520\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure S10b,  Supporting Information). Moreover, the photo current density  of   $6.22\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$   at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE for the 2-BVO-1.5h  dual photo anodes is almost equal to the photo current density  from the front BVO-1.5h film   $(5.38\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$  ) plus the back  BVO-1.5h film   $(0.8\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  .  \n\nThe PEC water splitting performances of the BVO-1.5h  films were further studied by decorating the surface with  FeOOH/NiOOH dual OECs. As shown in  Figure   3 a, the  pristine BVO-1.5h film exhibits a photo current density of   $2.38\\ \\mathrm{mA\\cm}^{-2}$   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE. With the surface modification of an   ${\\approx}10\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   layer of amorphous FeOOH/NiOOH dual  OECs (Figure S11, Supporting Information), the photo current  density is drastically increased to   $5.13\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$   (Figure 3a). In  addition, the surface charge transfer efficiency at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus  RHE is increased from 44.3 to   $95.3\\%$  (Figure S12, Supporting  Information), indicating the excellent surface kinetics for water  oxidation with FeOOH/NiOOH dual OECs.  Furthermore, the  2-BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes can generate  a photo current density of   $5.87~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/013e44ee09d2c4a2babc0bc7bb9f052165c21b522753b934e33eef36fe626653-1727117573.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   a) Photo current density versus applied potential curves and b) ABPE curves of the I: BVO-1.5h, II: BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH, and III: 2-BVO1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH films. c) Photo current density versus time of the 2-BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes at  $1.23\\,\\lor$   versus RHE under AM   $1.5\\subset$   illumination and d) gas evolution from PEC water splitting of the 2-BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes at  $1.23~\\lor$  versus RHE under  AM   $1.5\\odot$   illumination. All measurements were performed in a  $]\\texttt{M}$   potassium borate electrolyte   $(\\mathsf{p}\\mathsf{H}~9.5)$  .  \n\nand a remarkable ABPE of  $2.2\\%$   at   $0.7\\;\\mathrm{V}$   versus RHE (Figure 3b).  Compared to the BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH film, the ABPE  peak of the   $_{2\\cdot\\mathrm{BVO-1.5h/FeOH/NiOH}}$  is shifted slightly  (Figure 3b), which can be associated to the increase extent of the  photo current density at different applied potentials according  to Equation (S3) (Supporting Information). With an external  bias of   $1.23\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE for the   $_{2\\cdot\\mathrm{BVO}\\cdot1.5\\mathrm{h/FeOH/NiOH}}$  dual photo anodes, an average photo current density of around   $5.70\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   can be achieved for   $100\\mathrm{~h~}$   (Figure 3c), indicating  the excellent PEC stability of the films. Figure S13 (Supporting  Information) reveals that the FeOOH/NiOOH dual OECs are  still fully covered on the   $\\mathrm{BiVO}_{4}$   surface without any obvious  damage after  $100\\,\\mathrm{h}$   of the long-term stability measurement, indicating that FeOOH/NiOOH are robust and efficient OECs for  the BVO-1.5h films. Moreover, the overall water splitting properties of the 2-BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes were  also studied in an air-tight cell at   $1.23~\\mathrm{V}$   versus RHE under AM   $1.5~\\mathrm{G}$   illumination and the amount of the produced gases were  measured by a chromatography (GC) every  $30\\;\\mathrm{{min}}$  . As shown in  Figure 3d, the produced   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   and  $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   gases are 498 and   $247~\\upmu\\mathrm{mol}$   $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   after  $5\\mathrm{~h~}$  , respectively, indicating the 2:1 ratio of the water  splitting reaction with a faradaic efficiency of  ${\\approx}95\\%$  .  \n\nTo evaluate the unbiased water splitting performance of the  2-BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes, a sealed perovskite solar cell (PSC) was placed behind the photo anodes to  form a PEC/PV tandem device ( Figure   4 a). The PSC can generate a short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$   of   $23.08\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and  an open-circuit potential   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$   of 1.08 V, with a fill factor (FF)  \n\nof 0.76 (Figure 4b). The corresponding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC is   $18.82\\%$  . Before the assembly of the  PEC/PV tandem device, the performance of the front 2-BVO1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes and the rear PSC were  evaluated independently.
