Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Figure 5h displays the fitting curves of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and   $P_{\\mathrm{light}}$   according to the Equation of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\,\\propto\\,n k T/q\\,\\ln P_{\\mathrm{light}},$   where   $n$   is the ideal factor,   $k$   is the  Boltzmann constant,   $T$  is the Kelvin temperature, and   $q$   is  the elementary charge.  When the   $n$   value is close to 2, the  trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall recombination is dominant  in the devices.  Compared with the   $n$   value (1.87) of the control device without CBL, all of PVSCs employed CBL show a  lower fitted slope. In particular, the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device  exhibits the significantly lowest  n  value of 1.68, indicating that  TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL could more effectively reduce the trapassisted recombination.  \n\nThe effects of CBLs on the trap density and electron transport are quantitatively investigated by space-charge limited  current (SCLC) method with electron-only device structure of   $\\mathrm{ITO/SpO_{2}/M A P b I_{3}/P C B M/C B L/A g}$  . As shown in Figure 5i, the  double logarithmic plot of  $J{-}V$   curve contains three regions: an  ohmic response region   $(J\\propto\\,V)$  , a trap-filled limited (TFL) current region   $(J\\propto V^{n}$  ,   $n>3$  ), and a SCLC region   $(J\\propto V^{2})$  .  The  electron mobility   $(\\upmu_{e})$   of the device is caculated with the Equation of   $J\\,{=}\\,\\frac{9\\varepsilon_{r}\\varepsilon_{0}\\mu_{e}V^{2}}{8L^{3}}$  , where   $L$   is the thickness of perovskite  film,   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   is the relative dielectric constant and   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum  dielectric constant.   $V$   is the applied voltage. The TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    based device exhibits the highest   $\\upmu_{e}$   of   $3.3\\,\\times\\,10^{-5}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$    in three kinds of cells, contributing to more efficient charge  transport and extraction. The relationship between the initial  TFL voltage (  $(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}})$   and trap density   $(n_{\\mathrm{t}})$   can be described by the  Equation of   $V_{_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}=\\frac{q n_{t}L^{2}}{2\\varepsilon_{r}\\varepsilon_{0}}$  . The   $n_{\\mathrm{t}}$   values of the devices without  CBL, with  $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL and with TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL are calculated to be   $3.85\\times10^{16}$  ,   $2.27\\times10^{16}$  , and   $9.07\\times10^{15}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  , respectively. This result demonstrates that the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL  can remarkably improve interface contact quality and passivate  electronic defects.  We verified that   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL can  improve electrical conductivity and passivate PCBM/Ag interfacial defects, thereby increasing charge transport and reducing  charge recombination. Moreover, the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL with  higher electrical conductivity enables optimization of energy  level structure and effective inhibition of iodine ions migration  from perovskite layer to  $\\mathrm{Ag}$   cathode, thus realizing efficient carrier transport for higher photovoltaic performance.  \n\nFinally, the operational robustness of the PVSCs is also  investigated by humidity and thermal stability test as shown  in  Figure   7 . Figure  $7\\mathrm{a}$   displays the PCE changes of the devices  stored in air, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  S6 (Supporting Information). Compared to  the control device, the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  based device is more stable  and maintains   $70\\%$   of its initial PCE, while the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    based device exhibits further increased air stability with   $88\\%$    of the initial PCE. The performance evolutions of the devices  at   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in nitrogen atmosphere are summarized in Figure 7b  and Table  S7 (Supporting Information). After thermal aging  for   $100\\textrm{h}$  , the PCE of the control device without CBL rapidly  drops to   $18\\%$   of the initial PCE, and the  $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device  possesses slightly better thermal stability with   $50\\%$   of the initial PCE. However, the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  based device still retains   $85\\%$   of the initial PCE, showing significantly better thermal  stability. Compared with the control device and the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    based device, the TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  based device exhibits obviously improved operational stability, which may be attributed  to the obviously enhanced charge extraction and the effective  inhibition of iodine ions migration from perovskite layer to   $\\mathrm{Ag}$    cathode by the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL.
