Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The ability of DMF to fully dissolve these components is essential for the subsequent controlled crystallization process when this solution is mixed with a poor solvent.

Zener diode allows a wide range of currents when a reverse voltage  exceeds a threshold value which called Zener voltage. In this work, a  Zener diode with Zener voltage of   $10~\\lor$  has been chosen and connected  it at the output of the TENGs. As a result, the voltage of the TENGs is  regulated at  $10\\;\\lor.$  \n\nDevice  Characterization  and  Field  Testing  Conditions :  SEM  characterization was performed using an FEI Zeiss Merlin field  emission SEM. An Enlitech 350 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G filter was  used for 1 sun simulated illumination. A Thorlab NDK01 ND filter  kit was used to produce incident light at various intensities, from   $10~\\upmu\\mathbb{W}~{\\mathsf{c m}}^{-2}$   to   $100\\,\\,{\\sf m W}\\,\\,{\\sf c m}^{-2}$  . Note that   $10~\\upmu\\mathbb{W}~{\\mathsf{c m}}^{-2}$   is the lowest  intensity can be produced by this ND filter set. For   $I{-}V$   characterization  in conventional current detection mode, a Keithley 2420 source meter  was used to measure the current flow across the perovskite with  1 V DC bias. In the self-powered voltage detection mode, a National  Instruments BNC-2120 board with homemade data acquisition  software was used to measure the voltages across the perovskite while  the PD was being powered by the TENG.   $D^{*}$   and  R  were calculated  by Equations (1) and (2). For the bending and durability tests, the  voltage was measured across the perovskite PD under bending angles  of   $0^{\\circ}$  ,   $45^{\\circ}$  , and   $90^{\\circ}$  . At each bending angle, the voltage was measured  after the self-powered PD had been powered by finger tapping for  1, 500, and 1000 times. The voltages measured were normalized to  indicate the changes upon bending and prolonged operation. For the  conditions of the field test, the sunny and cloudy days occurred at N   $22^{\\circ}18^{\\prime}30^{\\prime\\prime}$   and E  $39^{\\circ}06^{\\prime}20^{\\prime\\prime}$   at 11:00 on March 16th, 2017 and 15:00 on  March 21st, 2017, respectively.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was financially supported by the King Abdullah University of  Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR2016-CRG5-3005), KAUST Sensor Initiative, KAUST Solar Center, and  KAUST baseline funding.  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\nflexible electronics, organometallic halide per ovsk ites, photodetector s,  self-powered electronics, solvent engineering, tri bo electric nano generators  \n\nReceived: August 14, 2017 Revised: November 2, 2017 Published online:  \n\n[1]\t X.  Gong, M.  Tong, Y.  Xia, W.  Cai, J.
