At present, several groups have achieved  appealing PCEs exceeding   $25\\%$  .  Among  them, most of works focused on optimizing  electron transport layer (ETL) and the inter­ face between perovskite layer and ETL.   This indicates that it is of critical impor­ tance to further minimize the efficiency  gap between practical value and Shockley − Queisser (SQ) limit value by minimizing  non radiative recombination losses at   $\\mathrm{ETL}/$  perovskite interface.  The tin oxide   $(\\mathrm{{SNO}_{2})}$    and titanium dioxide   $(\\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$   are usually  employed as ETLs in regular PSCs. The  PSCs based on both   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}^{\\cdot\\left[5,7,8\\right]}$   and   $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}^{[6,9]}$    ETLs have achieved high PCEs over   $25\\%$  .  However, the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   ETL still faces the fol­ lowing challenges: First, the high tempera­ ture annealing process is usually required  to fabricate  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   ETL, which will complicate  the device fabrication process and increase  device fabrication cost. Second, poor UV  stability was demonstrated for the PSCs  based on   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   ETL because   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   has photo­ catalytic activity. Finally, different levels  of hysteresis is often observed for the PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   ETL.  \n\nInterface engineering is one feasible and effective approach to minimize the  inter facial non radiative recombination stemming from inter facial defects,  inter facial residual stress, and inter facial energy level mismatch. Herein, a  novel and effective steric-hindrance-dependent buried interface defect passivation and stress release strategy is reported, which is implemented by  adopting a series of adamantane derivative molecules functional i zed with   $\\tt c{=}0$   (i.e., 2-adamant an one (AD), 1-adamantane carboxylic acid (ADCA), and  1-adamant a ne acetic acid (ADAA)) to modify   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2I}$  /perovskite interface. All  modifiers play a role in pas siva ting inter facial defects, mitigating inter facial  strain, and enhancing device performance. The steric hindrance of chemical  interaction between  $\\tt c{=}0$   in these molecules and per ovsk ites as well as  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$    is determined by the distance between  $\\tt c{=}0$   and bulky adamantane ring,  which gradually decreases from AD, ADCA, and ADAA. The experimental and  theoretical evidences together confirmed steric-hindrance-dependent defect  pass iv ation effect and inter facial chemical interaction strength. The inter facial  chemical interaction strength, defect pass iv ation effect, stress release effect  and thus device performance are negatively correlated with steric hindrance.  Consequently, the ADAA-modified device achieves a seductive efficiency up  to  $\\mathbf{23.18\\%}$  . The un encapsulated devices with ADAA maintain  $\\mathbf{81\\%}$   of its initial  efficiency after aging at  $\\mathbf{60\\,^{\\circ}C}$   for  $\\mathbf{\\bar{\\boldsymbol{000}}}\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{h}}}$  .  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nIn contrast,   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   has been demonstrated to be hopeful electron  transport material due to its high electron mobility, low film  annealing temperature, and low photo catalytic activity.  \n\nThe excellent op to electronic properties of organic–inorganic  hybrid metal halide per ovsk ites make them find appropriate  applications in various photoelectric devices. Since Miyasaka  et al.  for the first time reported perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with  \n\nIn the regular PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL, perovskite/hole  transport layer (HTL) and perovskite/ETL interfaces are critical  to efficient and stable PSCs. In the past, most studies focused  on modulating perovskite/HTL interface. In contrast, the report  on the engineering perovskite/ETL interface is relatively lim­ ited.  Presently, the perovskite/ETL interface in regular device  is usually called a buried interface. On the one hand, the predeposited interface molecules at perovskite/ETL interface are  easy to be dissolved by the polar solvents (e.g., dimethyl forma­ mide (DMF) and dimethyl s ulf oxide (DMSO)) in perovskite pre­ cursor solution. On the other hand, in situ characterization of  the defects at buried interface is much tougher than at top inter­ face.  On account of this, it is more challenging to manipulate  perovskite/ETL interface than perovskite/HTL interface. The  defects at buried interface, which originate from not only the  lower surface of perovskite films, but also the upper surface of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   films, are one of the main reasons for the non radiative  recombination loss of inter facial carriers.  The rapid crystal­ lization process would lead to the generation of a large number  of defects in poly crystalline perovskite films, which usually dis­ tribute at grain boundary (GB) and interface.  These defects  are usually deep level defects, which would bring about serious  carrier non radiative recombination and thus deteriorate device  performance. In addition, there are often a mass of oxygen  vacancy defects on the surface of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL, which would  reduce its electron extraction and transport efficiencies, causing  carrier non radiative recombination and thereby decreasing  device photovoltaic performance.  The residual strain  induced by stress usually exists in perovskite films, which can  be classified into compressive and tensile strain. The strain  produced in perovskite films could be ascribed to many fac­ tors, such as coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) difference  between per ovsk ites and charge transport materials (CTMs),  lattice mismatch between perovskite film and substrate, tem­ perature gradient, light/bias stimulation, phase transitions, and  GBs.  The strain in perovskite films has a significant effect  on band structure, carrier mobility, bandgap, ion migration,  and defect formation energy. It was revealed that the tensile  strain can increase bandgap while the compressive strain can  decrease the bandgap.  The carrier mobility was increased  through regulating cation stacking pattern and thus miti­ gating micro strain.  The compressive strain was reported to  increase the activation energy of ion migration and the tensile  strain reduced the activation energy of ion migration.  Conse­ quently, the tensile strain would result in carrier non radiative  recombination, which is detrimental to the PCE and stability  of PSCs.  It is urgently needed to develop suitable interface  modification molecules to heal the trap states and release stress  at buried interface.  \n\nTo date, systematic and deep investigation has been per­ formed to passivate the defects and release stress at buried  interface. For example, it was reported in our previous studies  that ImAcHCl  and FBABF 4  ionic liquid molecules can  effectively passivate inter facial defects, improve inter facial  energy band alignment, and modulate perovskite crystal  growth. We also adopted inorganic salt   $\\mathrm{K}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{4}$   to modify   $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2}/$  perovskite interface with the simultaneous realization of inter­ facial defect pass iv ation and energy band modulation.  Zhao  et al. incorporated CsI into   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL and revealed that inter­ facial defect pass iv ation, perovskite crystal growth promotion,  improved band alignment, and enhanced UV stability were  achieved simultaneously after CsI modification for buried inter­ face.
