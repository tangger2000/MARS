T. Redfern, Haotong Wei, Haiyu Wang, Huaizhong Shen, Wei Zhang,   Weitao Zheng, Hao Zhang, John S. Tse, and Bai Yang\\*  \n\nlifetime,   high  charge  carrier  mobility,  and tunable bandgap.  As  a result of rapid progress in both device  architectures and compositional engineering, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as   $22.1\\%$   has been  achieved.  The high efficiency of perovskite solar cells benefits from the high  open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$   with low energy  losses   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{loss}}\\right)$  .  \n\nCesium-based trihalide per ovsk ites have been demonstrated as promising light  absorbers for photovoltaic applications due to their superb composition stability.  However, the large energy losses   $(E_{\\mathsf{l o s s}})$   observed in inorganic perovskite solar  cells has become a major hindrance impairing the ultimate efficiency. Here, an  effective and reproducible method of modifying the interface between a  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$  absorber and poly thi oph ene hole-acceptor to minimize the   $E_{\\mathsf{l o s s}}$    is reported. It is  demonstrated that poly thi oph ene, deposited on the top of   $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r},$  , can significantly reduce electron-hole recombination within the perovskite, which is due  to the electronic pass iv ation of surface defect states. In addition, the inter facial  properties are improved by a simple annealing process, leading to significantly  reduced energy disorder in poly thi oph ene and enhanced hole-injection into the  hole-acceptor. Consequently, one of the highest power conversion efficiency  (PCE) of   $\\mathbf{12.02\\%}$   from a reverse scan in inorganic mixed-halide perovskite solar  cells is obtained. Modifying the perovskite films with annealing poly thi oph ene  enables an open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{oc}})$   of up to  $\\mathbf{1.32\\,V}$   and   $E_{\\mathsf{l o s s}}$   of down to   $0.5\\,\\mathrm{{eV},}$    which both are the optimal values reported among cesium-lead mixed-halide  perovskite solar cells to date. This method provides a new route to further  improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by minimizing the   $E_{\\mathsf{l o s s}}$  .  \n\nThe   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   can be described by the equation:   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}\\,=\\,E_{\\mathrm{g}}\\,-\\,e V_{\\mathrm{OC}},$   where   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   is the optical  bandgap of the light absorber and   $e$   is the  charge of an electron. Upon decreasing   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}},~V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  will improve and thus the PCE  will increase. An optimized organic– inorganic perovskite photovoltaic device  generally has a high   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   larger than   $1\\;\\mathrm{~V~}$  with   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   below   $0.6\\;\\;\\mathrm{eV},$   which partially accounts for the high PCE of over   $20\\%$  .  However, the thermally unstable  nature of organic materials severely limits  their commercial utility.  As an alternative, all-inorganic per ovsk ites, prized  for their superb stability toward moisture, light soaking, and  \n\nMetal trihalide per ovsk ites materials are promising for nextgeneration solution-processed solar cells because of their high  absorption coefficient,  long charge carrier recombination  \n\nthermal stressing, have received a great deal of attention. A variety of deposition techniques including spin-coating,  \n\ntwo-step sequential method,  vapor deposition,  and  spray-assisted deposition  have been developed to produce  high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films. The recent achievement of strongly emissive   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   nano crystal (NC) inks for  photovoltaic prototype device has provided a new pathway for  large-scale, single-step fabrication of perovskite solar cells.  In  spite of rapid progress in film preparation, the efficiencies of  all-inorganic perovskite solar cells achieved to date leave much  room for further improvement, principally as a result of their  large   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$  .  \n\nFigure   1  shows plots of   $e V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   against   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   for all inorganic  perovskite solar cells reported so far, and the detail performance parameters are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). One of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   NC solar cell attains a PCE of   $10.77\\%$    with the minimum   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   of   $0.52~\\mathrm{eV}.^{[23]}$   The   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   for most inorganic perovskite devices lies between 0.7 and   $0.9\\ \\mathrm{eV};$   for one  of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   device, the value even reaches 1.06. Large  values of   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   reflect defect states,  energy disorder,  and/ or in homogeneous energy landscape  that generate non­ radiative energy loss channels and thus lead to reductions in   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}};$   hence, there is considerable scope to increase the PCE  of inorganic perovskite solar cells by boosting   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  . Recently,  the cesium lead mixed-halide per ovsk ites,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  , have  attracted increasing attention, which is due to their better  structure stability in the cubic phase than the fully iodide \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   counterparts,  and reasonable broad bandgaps of \n\n  $1.82~\\mathrm{eV}$   with great potential applying in semi transparent and  tandem solar cells.  More recently, Park group reported efficient   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells with the highest   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   by  optimizing the crystallization process.  So far, the record  efficiency of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells is around   $11\\%$   with a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$    of   ${\\approx}1.2\\,\\mathrm{~V.~}$   Therefore, it is of great urgent to reduce the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$    to improve the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and thus PCE of inorganic cesium lead  mixed-halide perovskite solar cells.  \n\nIn this paper, we report a systematic study to minimize the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite solar cells. The photo active layers  are deposited from   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   NC solution, and the as-prepared  film exhibits a sharp band-tail that enables efficient charge  transfer, evidenced by the transient absorption (TA) spectra.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/9048553834fb0d0b4decb4dcb35055f256790dc7e0045dc989bad086a27bbf90-1727116091.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Plots of   $e V_{\\mathsf{O C}}$   against   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   for inorganic\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
