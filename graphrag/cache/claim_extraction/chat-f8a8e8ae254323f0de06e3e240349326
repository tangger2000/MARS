{"result": "## (DS<|>CH3NH3PbI3<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>DS additive plays a crucial role in the synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. It is added to the perovskite solution to increase the grain size and improve the crystalline quality of the films. The interaction between DS and PbI2 leads to the formation of a chelated intermediate complex, which slows down the crystallization rate and results in larger grain size and better crystalinity. The use of DS additive is more effective in improving the perovskite film compared with DMSO, yielding better device performance.<|>The perovskite precursor solution with concentration of   $1.2\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$   for   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{I}$   (MAI) was prepared under  stirring at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $2\\textrm{h}$  . Then, different volume ratios of DS  were added into the filtered perovskite solution, and the  mixed solution was stirred at room temperature for   $2\\textrm{h}$  . The   $\\mathrm{parallel}_{3}\\mathrm{-D}\\mathrm{S}$   perovskite films were fabricated by spin-coating  and obtained after heating at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $10~\\mathrm{min}$  . More details  can be seen in the Experimental Section.  Figure   1 a,b shows  the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$     $\\left(\\operatorname{MAPbI}_{3}\\right)$  ) films prepared without and with the  DS additive   $(\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}–\\mathrm{DS})$  ). The perovskite grain size obviously  increases when the DS additive was used. Figure 1c shows  grain size distribution for these two samples. It is clear that the  average grain size of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   film made without additive is  only   ${\\approx}151$   nm, it is increased to as large as   ${\\approx}409$   nm when it is  prepared using the DS additive, as labeled   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}–\\mathrm{DS}}$  . Figure  S1 (Supporting Information) shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}–\\mathrm{DS}}$   samples. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the   $\\mathrm{\\sfMAPI}_{3^{-}}$  DS is increased to 11.1 from   $7.76\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   for the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  . The  slightly bigger RMS is reported to help light trapping, which  is beneficial to enhanced   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}.{}^{[41]}$   Figure 1d shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   and MAPbI 3 –DS films. The  intensity of all the characteristic peaks in the   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$  sample show obvious increase compared to that of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  ,  demonstrating significantly improved crystal lin it y. The large  grain size and good crystalline quality are known as important  to high performance F-PSCs.  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is performed  to understand the function of DS additive in the perovskite  thin film deposition process. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows the molecular structures of the   $\\nsucc$  bu tyrol act one  (GBL) solvent and the DS additive. Figure S3 (Supporting Information) displays the FTIR spectra of GBL, DS,   $\\mathrm{GBL+PbI}_{2}$  , and   $\\mathrm{GBL+PbI_{2}+D S}$   samples, with their signature peak attribution  summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). It is clear  that the GBL peaks show no significant change when   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$    was dissolved, indicating that there is no reaction between  GBL and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . In comparison, for the DS sample, its characteristic peak ascribed to   $C{-}S$   stretching vibration appears at   $\\approx\\!973~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  ,  it is shifted to around   $954~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   when it is added  into   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   solution, demonstrating strong interaction between   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   and DS molecules as it is expected that they would react  to form a chelated intermediate complex. As given in Figure S4  (Supporting Information), the soft Lewis base of DS molecule  can coordinate with lead ions to form a hex a coordinated compound, which allows less configuration al entropy loss, leading  to smaller Gibbs free energy during perovskite crystallization  process.  As a result, the crystallization rate of perovskite  is slowed down by the complex, leading to larger grain size  and better crystal lin it y in the perovskite films, in good agreement with the SEM and XRD measurements. Compared with  the dimethyl s ulf oxide (DMSO),  there are mainly three  advantages to use DS additive during perovskite crystallization  process. i) The sulfur atoms in DS have smaller electron eg ativity (2.5) than that of oxygen atoms (3.5) in DMSO. Thus, the  sulfur atoms are more capable of providing electrons to coordinate with the empty Pb 5d orbitals, resulting in a hexacoordinated complex (Figure S4, Supporting Information). ii) The  relative polarity of DS molecule is 0.472, stronger than that  of DMSO (0.444),  which is more beneficial for DS to form  stable intermediate with the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  .  In fact, the chelated intermediate complex has been demonstrated by FTIR, as shown in  Figure S3 (Supporting Information). iii) The Gibbs free energy  of the lead atoms combined with sulfur in DS is smaller than  that of the lead atoms complexed by oxygen in DMSO.   The smaller Gibbs free energy means more favorable interaction between   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and DS to generate more stable intimidate  compared to the DMSO. The stronger interaction between   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$    and DS offers more positive influence on the perovskite crystal  growth during the perovskite crystallization process, in agreement with the experimental results. Compared to the DMSObased complex, the more stable DS-based intermediate leads to  more difficult dissociation, which significantly slows the rate of  perovskite crystallization, resulting in large grains with better  crystal lin it y (Figure 1). Therefore, the DS additive is more  effective in improving the perovskite film compared with the  DMSO, yielding better device performance.  The F-PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$   were fabricated to analyze the effect of the DS additive.  Figure   2 a illustrates the F-PSC structure, wherein a   $60~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   thick   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{5}$   layer  was used as the ESL as deposited according to our previous  report,    $^{2,2^{\\prime},7,7^{\\prime}}$  -tetrakis( N , N -di  $\\cdot p$  -meth oxy phenyl amine)-9,9 ′ - spiro bif luo rene (spiro-OMeTAD) as a hole selective layer,   $\\mathrm{MgF}_{2}$  as an anti reflection layer,   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   with and without DS additive  as the absorber, PET/indium tin oxide (ITO) and gold as the  cathode and anode, respectively. As both the conductivity and  transmittance of the ITO anode are known to play important  roles in high performance solar cells, we therefore fabricated  different thicknesses of ITO layers to quantify its effect. Figure  S5a (Supporting Information) shows the optical transmittance  spectra of different ITO thicknesses on the PET substrate. It  is apparent that the transmittance decreases with increase of  the ITO layer thickness, while the conductivity is significantly  increased as expected. Accordingly, the F-PSCs based on various ITO thicknesses were fabricated, and their current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   characteristics and key parameters are shown  in Figure S5b and Table S2 (Supporting Information). It can be  seen that the device with   $90\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick ITO gives the highest   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   due to the good transmittance, while the FF is the smallest  because of the largest sheet resistance   $(92~\\Omega)$  . When the ITO  thickness is increased to   $180\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   decreases due to the reduced transmittance, but the FF increases due to the lower sheet resistance. The overall performance of the device with   $180\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick ITO is comparable to that with   $90\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick ITO, indicating that the ITO thickness has a significant impact on the device performance.  The effect of DS additive on the device performance was further investigated by fabricating F-PSCs with different DS concentrations. Figure 3a shows the J-V characteristics of the F-PSCs with different DS concentrations. It can be seen that the device with 0.5 wt% DS additive exhibits the highest efficiency, while the efficiency decreases with increasing DS concentration. This is because the excessive DS additive can lead to the formation of large grains, which may cause recombination and reduce the device performance. Therefore, the optimal DS concentration for the F-PSCs is 0.5 wt%.  In conclusion, the DS additive is an effective method to improve the performance of F-PSCs. It can increase the grain size and improve the crystalline quality of the perovskite films, leading to better device performance. The optimal DS concentration for the F-PSCs is 0.5 wt%.

Therefore, the DS additive is more  effective in improving the perovskite film compared with the  DMSO, yielding better device performance.  \n\nThe F-PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$   were fabricated to analyze the effect of the DS additive.  Figure   2 a illustrates the F-PSC structure, wherein a   $60~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   thick   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{5}$   layer  was used as the ESL as deposited according to our previous  report,    $^{2,2^{\\prime},7,7^{\\prime}}$  -tetrakis( N , N -di  $\\cdot p$  -meth oxy phenyl amine)-9,9 ′ - spiro bif luo rene (spiro-OMeTAD) as a hole selective layer,   $\\mathrm{MgF}_{2}$  as an anti reflection layer,   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   with and without DS additive  as the absorber, PET/indium tin oxide (ITO) and gold as the  cathode and anode, respectively. As both the conductivity and  transmittance of the ITO anode are known to play important  roles in high performance solar cells, we therefore fabricated  different thicknesses of ITO layers to quantify its effect. Figure  S5a (Supporting Information) shows the optical transmittance  spectra of different ITO thicknesses on the PET substrate. It  is apparent that the transmittance decreases with increase of  the ITO layer thickness, while the conductivity is significantly  increased as expected. Accordingly, the F-PSCs based on various ITO thicknesses were fabricated, and their current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   characteristics and key parameters are shown  in Figure S5b and Table S2 (Supporting Information). It can be  seen that the device with   $90\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick ITO gives the highest   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   due to the good transmittance, while the FF is the smallest  because of the largest sheet resistance   $(92~\\Omega)$  . When the ITO  thickness is increased to   $180\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , the   $J_{\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
