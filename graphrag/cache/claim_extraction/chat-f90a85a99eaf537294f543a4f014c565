Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  analysis further confirms the coordination between carboxyl ate  and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   cations, as shown in Figure S4b (Supporting Information). The XPS O 1s spectrum revealed three clear peaks at \n\n  $529.4~\\mathrm{eV}$     $\\mathrm{(Pb-O}$   bond),   $531.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$   bond), and   $532.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   \n\n (C  O bond), in contrast to the single peak at   $531.3\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   (absorption of the water molecules) for pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   film.  \n\nTo study the effect of OTG molecules on the crystallization  process of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite, we compared the XRD patterns  of pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   and the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}$   films ( Figure   2 a). The  main diffraction peaks of pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   appeared at   $14.4^{\\circ}$  ,   $20.6^{\\circ}$  , and   $28.9^{\\circ}$  . We attributed them to the preferred orientations of (110), (020), and (220), respectively.

This structure is frequently found in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite processed with   $\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   or HI in the precursor  solution.  Interestingly, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}$   films exhibited  an obvious decrease of peak intensity for the (002), (112), and  (004) planes, especially in the case of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$  . These  observations further point to the fact that fabrication of large  steric hindrance terminal groups on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   surface is critical for suppressing the octahedral tilting of   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   units in  the perovskite lattice. In addition, the fact that the XRD pattern  of the CsPbI 3 –OTG films did not show any additional peaks  associated with the 2D structure is attributable to the fact that  large organic molecules could not permeate into the perovskite  lattice. Besides, the UV–vis spectrum (Figure S5, Supporting  Information) indicated that the presence of OTG molecules did  not affect the UV–vis absorption and the bandgap of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  perovskite.  \n\nFigure 2b illustrates the XRD patterns of the corresponding  perovskite films after they were kept in moist air for   $12\\,\\textrm{h}$  .  For the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   films, the diffraction peaks of the  black phase almost disappeared along with the strong peaks  located at   $9.8^{\\circ}$   and   $12.9^{\\circ}$   attributable to the presence of the  ortho rhombi c yellow phase.  The fact that the XRD pattern  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   film was very similar to that of the fresh  sample indicated that suppressing   $\\mathrm{[Pbl_{6}]^{4-}}$  octahedral tilting  played a vital role in hindering the phase transition of the  black phase of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  . Figure S6 (Supporting Information) also  shows the color change versus the time of aging of the corresponding perovskite films. The phase-stabilizing effect of OTG  molecules under treatment with another polar solvent was also  investigated by dipping perovskite films in ethanol. Figure S7  (Supporting Information) shows the XRD patterns of those  films. We found that the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   black phase treated with OTG3  also exhibited much higher resistance to phase transition than  the black phase of the pristine sample.  \n\nWe used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterize  the impact of OTG molecules on the surface morphology of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite films. Top-view SEM images of the corresponding perovskite films (Figure 2c–f) revealed little difference  in grain size before and after treatment with OTG molecules,  as is apparent in the distributions of grain sizes (Figure S8,  Supporting Information). Previous reports have demonstrated  that minimizing the grain sizes (increasing the surface/volume  ratios) is an efficient way to stabilize the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   black phase.  The fact that the highly symmetrical cubic structure usually has  a surface energy smaller than that of the ortho rhombi c structure  leads to a reduction of the total Gibbs free energy of the material surface.  This observation confirms that the mechanism  of phase stabilization of OTG molecules is not associated with  reduction of the grain size of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite. In addition,  we used energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) to determine  the distribution of elements in the modified perovskite films.  Figure S9 (Supporting Information) shows the element mapping profiles of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   films.  \n\nFigure    3 a illustrates the phase stabilizing mechanism of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite with OTG molecules as the surface capping layer. First, OTG molecules in the precursor solution are  thought to act as nucleation sites for the growth of the cubic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   black phase. This step is followed by formation of a  perovskite film with a surface OTG capping layer. After exposure to moisture or another polar solvent, the bulk alkyl chains  of the OTG molecules provide steric hindrance that suppresses  the tilting\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
