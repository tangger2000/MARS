Therefore, it is of great urgency  to reduce the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   for further improving the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   toward highly  efficient   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs by synergic optimization of perovskite film and device interface.  Toward this goal, our work here demonstrates that the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   FF, and PCE can be improved simultaneously through  the introduction of   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL to fabricate allinorganic PVSCs based on a novel conventional architecture   $\\mathrm{(ITO/S nO_{2}/Z n O/C s P b I_{2}B r/S}$  Spiro-OMeTAD/  $\\mathrm{{MoO}_{3}/A g})$  ).  The  high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with regular crystal grains and full  coverage can be realized on the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   surface. The higherlying conduction band minimum (CBM) of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$     $(-4.21\\,\\mathrm{\\eV})$  facilitates the desirable cascade energy level alignment between  perovskite and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL with stronger electron  extraction capability than that based on single-layer metal oxide   $\\mathrm{ETL},$   resulting in a suppressed inter facial trap-assisted recombination with lower charge recombination rate and greater charge  extraction efficiency. The as-optimized all-inorganic PVSC  delivered a high   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   and a PCE of   $14.6\\%$  , which is  one of the best efficiencies reported for the Cs-based all-inorganic PVSCs to date (Table S1, Supporting Information). More  importantly, decent thermal stability with only   $20\\%$   PCE loss  was demonstrated for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -based   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs  after being heated at   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $300\\textrm{h}$  . This work not only demonstrates a simple but effective method to enhance the performance of all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs, but also provides an  important interface design strategy that may also be applied to  improve other perovskite op to electronic devices.  The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite films were prepared via a simple  one-step solution process with high reproducibility. The formation of all-inorganic perovskite transition film during the firststep annealing procedure with low temperature was found to  play a critical role in improving the device performance.   Therefore,  by  optimizing  two-step  temperature-control  annealing procedure, the dark-brown   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite film  formed on the commonly used   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   or   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL and the new  bilayered   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   ETL exhibited equally strong X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks at  $14.6^{\\circ}$  ,   $20.8^{\\circ}$  , and  $29.5^{\\circ}$  , which correspond to  the (100), (110), and (200) crystal planes of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   cubic  perovskite structure, respectively ( Figure   1 , and Figure S1,  Supporting Information).  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite film showed  a well-defined multi crystalline structure with full coverage and  regular crystal grains along the [100] direction on both the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   ETLs. The high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite  film is a prerequisite of highly efficient all-inorganic PVSCs  with low   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$  .  The effects of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL on  the cell performance were investigated based on the conventional device architecture of ITO/ETL/CsPbI 2 Br/SpiroOMeTAD/  $\\mathrm{{\\prime}M o O_{3}/A g}$   ( Figure   2 ). A layered structure with sharp  interfaces could be observed in the cross-sectional scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) image of the multilayer film. The  CBM values of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   are derived from the valence  band maximum (VBM) values determined by ultraviolet   photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and their bandgap  $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$   values  determined by UV âˆ’ vis absorption spectroscopy (Figures S2  and S3, Table S2, Supporting Information), while the energy  levels of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   are extracted from literature.
