Therefore, it is of great urgency  to reduce the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   for further improving the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   toward highly  efficient   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs by synergic optimization of perovskite film and device interface.  Toward this goal, our work here demonstrates that the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   FF, and PCE can be improved simultaneously through  the introduction of   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL to fabricate allinorganic PVSCs based on a novel conventional architecture   $\\mathrm{(ITO/S nO_{2}/Z n O/C s P b I_{2}B r/S}$  Spiro-OMeTAD/  $\\mathrm{{MoO}_{3}/A g})$  ).  The  high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with regular crystal grains and full  coverage can be realized on the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   surface. The higherlying conduction band minimum (CBM) of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$     $(-4.21\\,\\mathrm{\\eV})$  facilitates the desirable cascade energy level alignment between  perovskite and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL with stronger electron  extraction capability than that based on single-layer metal oxide   $\\mathrm{ETL},$   resulting in a suppressed inter facial trap-assisted recombination with lower charge recombination rate and greater charge  extraction efficiency. The as-optimized all-inorganic PVSC  delivered a high   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   and a PCE of   $14.6\\%$  , which is  one of the best efficiencies reported for the Cs-based all-inorganic PVSCs to date (Table S1, Supporting Information). More  importantly, decent thermal stability with only   $20\\%$   PCE loss  was demonstrated for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -based   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs  after being heated at   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $300\\textrm{h}$  . This work not only demonstrates a simple but effective method to enhance the performance of all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs, but also provides an  important interface design strategy that may also be applied to  improve other perovskite op to electronic devices.  The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite films were prepared via a simple  one-step solution process with high reproducibility. The formation of all-inorganic perovskite transition film during the firststep annealing procedure with low temperature was found to  play a critical role in improving the device performance.   Therefore,  by  optimizing  two-step  temperature-control  annealing procedure, the dark-brown   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite film  formed on the commonly used   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   or   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL and the new  bilayered   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   ETL exhibited equally strong X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks at  $14.6^{\\circ}$  ,   $20.8^{\\circ}$  , and  $29.5^{\\circ}$  , which correspond to  the (100), (110), and (200) crystal planes of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   cubic  perovskite structure, respectively ( Figure   1 , and Figure S1,  Supporting Information).  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite film showed  a well-defined multi crystalline structure with full coverage and  regular crystal grains along the [100] direction on both the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   ETLs. The high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite  film is a prerequisite of highly efficient all-inorganic PVSCs  with low   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$  .  The effects of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL on  the cell performance were investigated based on the conventional device architecture of ITO/ETL/CsPbI 2 Br/SpiroOMeTAD/  $\\mathrm{{\\prime}M o O_{3}/A g}$   ( Figure   2 ). A layered structure with sharp  interfaces could be observed in the cross-sectional scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) image of the multilayer film. The  CBM values of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   are derived from the valence  band maximum (VBM) values determined by ultraviolet   photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and their bandgap  $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$   values  determined by UV − vis absorption spectroscopy (Figures S2  and S3, Table S2, Supporting Information), while the energy  levels of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   are extracted from literature.

The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.
