Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Hence, to prevent the relaxation of the phase, an additive, such  as MAX, must be added to the   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$   lattice. This substitution results in the formation of a cubic phase. The cubic phase  of HMHP materials enhances the charge carrier lifetime after  charge excitation, by increasing Rashba–Dress el haus coupling,  thus making the method suitable for the development of highly  efficient solar cell devices. However, the sustainability of this  crystal phase is associated with the full disorder of the A-site  organic molecules.  \n\nMany reports have discussed ion and defect migrations at  the built-in potential under operating conditions. The origin  of these migrations in bulk HMHPs is related to defect formation. Many types of defects form at the conduction and valence  bands. Primary defects, for example,   $I_{\\mathrm{i}},$     $V_{\\mathrm{Pb}},\\;I_{\\mathrm{MA}},$   and   $I_{\\mathrm{Pb}}$  , form  at the valence band sites, whereas   $\\mathrm{{Pb}_{\\mathrm{{i}}}}$  ,  $\\mathrm{MA_{i}}$  , and  $\\mathrm{Pb_{I}}$   form at the  conduction band sites in   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  . Defect formation is affected  by the substitution with different halides, in the   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX_{3}}$  system. The defect formation enthalpy for the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   system  was determined to be the lowest, compared with those for the  other two halides.  \n\nFurthermore, another factor that affects defect formation is  the fragmentation of A-site organic molecules; the representative   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation readily undergoes this process under operating conditions or during the formation of HMHP thin films.  Simulations reveal that the fragmentation of   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cations can  produce H,   $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  . The  charged by-products easily migrate to the inorganic lattice  and react with anionic halide and cationic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$  . Furthermore,  hydrogen atoms also dissociate from MA and influence defect  formation. For highly stable HMHP materials and devices,  the fragmentation of MA and the migration of hydrogen  must be controlled. Hydrogen atoms are lost from the A-site  organic molecules, as   $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{H}^{0}$  , and   $\\mathrm{H^{-}}$  . These hydrogen species undergo secondary reactions with surrounding molecules,  atoms, and ions. Therefore, because the intrinsic chemical  instability of halide per ovsk ites is mainly caused by the MA  cations, it is very important to find new additives that increase  the structural stability of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   without using MA. If these  processes are modulated, many instability issues can be  resolved, allowing the generation of highly stable materials for  the commercialization of these devices. In addition, the chemical stability may also be significantly increased by the introduction of divalent or trivalent inorganic cations and divalent  anions into the   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   sites.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea  (NRF) grant from the Korean government (MSIT) (2018 R 1 A 3 B 1052820,  2011-0031565, 2015M1A2A2056542).
