Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

It is clear that  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  -based RRAM with different top electrode materials exhibits typical resistive switching effect. However, the  SET voltage of the ITO/PMMA/CsPbBr 3 /PMMA/Ag structured  memory device is   $2.4~\\mathrm{V},$   which is smaller when compared with  SET voltage of the Au-top-electrode-based RRAM (4.5 V).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/cae0524460728accf29a64c70130fd4d856c2fb58d029dc2db36adaa4aa5c703-1727117036.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a)   $I{-}V$  characteristic of the ITO/PMMA/CsPbBr 3 /PMMA/metal structured memory device based on different metal anode. b) Formation  tendency of  $\\mathsf{A g}$   filament observed in the SEM images of   $\\mathsf{A g}/\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{A g}$   device after low bias stimulation.

The phenomenon  is in consistent with the previous reported studies.  For  Au-anode-based RRAM, the reaction on the Au anode can be  expressed as   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}\\leftrightarrow B r+e^{-}}$  at low anodic potential, while the  Au top electrode may react with the   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   to form a negative  charged complex such as   $\\mathrm{A u B r}_{2}^{\\;-}/\\mathrm{A u B r}_{4}^{\\;-}$   at high anodic potential (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The anchored   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   ions  will diffuse back into the perovskite layer once the bias voltage is  removed. For Ag-anode-based RRAM, the Ag top electrode with  high electro chemically activity can preserve the   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   ions to form   $\\mathrm{AgBr}_{x}$  . The whole recombination process is reversible, which can  be expressed as   $\\mathrm{Ag+Br^{-}\\leftrightarrow A g B r+e^{-}}$  . The electrode potential  of   $E^{0}$   $(\\mathrm{AgBr/Br^{-}})$   (0.07133 V) of Ag anode is lower than   $E^{0}$   (  $|\\mathrm{Br}_{2}/$  Br − ) (1.066 V) of Au anode. Thus, the migration of the   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   ions  is accelerated in the Ag-anode-based RRAM device. At the meantime, bromide vacancy   $(\\mathrm{V_{Br}}^{+})$   is formed inside the film after   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   anions impelled toward Ag top electrode.   ${\\mathrm{V_{Br}}}^{+}$   induces conducting channels and subsequent transition from HRS to LRS.  Additionally,   ${\\mathrm{V_{Br}}}^{+}$   is well-known n-type dopants to upward shift  the energy band of perovskite and decrease the Schottky barrier.  \n\nOn the other hand, as an active metal, Ag is more facile to be  ionized into  $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}}$   cation under external bias. The applied voltage  on the anode will facilitate the further migration of   $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}}$   toward  cathode through   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs’ active layer. Finally,   $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}}$   cations  are reduced to neutral   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   atoms, leading to the nucleation  and growth of Ag cluster inside the active layers and eventual  formation of nanoscale Ag filaments via the nucleation process  after capturing charge carriers. Both the Ag metallic filaments  and   ${\\mathrm{V_{Br}}}^{+}$   filaments are attributed to switching from HRS to  LRS in Ag-anode-based RRAM, which is in consistent with the  above-mentioned result that the SET voltage of Ag-anode-based  RRAM is lower than the value of Au-anode-based RRAM.  \n\nThe hypothesis has been further verified by the SEM measurements and EDX analysis. Top-viewed SEM images of lateral structured RRAM under low-voltage bias stimulation and after SET  operation are compared in Figure 4b and Figure 4c. Multiple Ag filaments are grown between the anode and cathode under the applied  external voltage bias. We further measured the elemental distribution of   $\\mathrm{Ag}.\\mathrm{Pb}$   in the regions along the Ag filament and a randomly  selected area as shown in Figure 4c. According to EDX results, high  density of Ag is detected in the region close to the filament, and  much lower amount of Ag is measured in the randomly selected  area. The Br:Pb ratios of locations 1–4, labeled in Figure 4c, gradually increase from 0.75, 1.05, 1.92 to 2.50, respectively. While the  Br:Pb ratio collected from location 5, which is not in the same lateral  direction of locations 1–4, is 0.99, demonstrating a uniform distribution of   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   ions inside the film. Possible scenarios of the resistive  switching process are shown in Figure 4d,e, and the corresponding  variation of the energy level diagrams is shown in Figure  $^{4\\mathrm{g,h}}$  . Compared with reported works on perovskite-based non volatile memory  device, our work presents the RRAM with the competitive performance parameters which are summarized in  Table   1 .  \n\nTable 1.   Comparison of various perovskite-based RRAM devices. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/a8fcea2eea7afa287fab86684f706bf3cfb44e80d3c35ab22a3b1661cdfb61ca-1727117087.jpg)  \n\nTwo distinct mechanisms are attributed to the photo­ response behavior of photonic RRAM. The possible scenario  of the photo-assisted resistive switching process is shown  in Figure   $4\\mathrm{f}$  while the corresponding energy level diagram is  shown in Figure 4i. By absorbing photons with  energy higher  than the value of the bandgap, an electron–hole pair can be generated in  ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs, thus rendering the photovoltaic effect.  The excitons are divided in the interface between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs  and PMMA by the electric field and further drifted toward the  metal electrodes in opposite directions. Subsequently, the photogating effect plays a key role in next vacancy filament and  metal filament formation processes. The photo generated electron/hole pairs are split at the   $\\mathrm{{\\small PMMA}/C s P b B r}_{3}$   interface by  the external electric field. The separated charge carriers could  be further arrested by QDs to form an additional internal electrical field. Then   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   ions can be more effectively driven to the  Ag anode under an enhanced field. Meanwhile, more   $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}}$   is  repelled toward the ITO cathode to be reduced into   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   cluster.  Spontaneously, more released   ${\\mathrm{V_{Br}}}^{+}$   and formation of Ag clusters will accumulate in the perovskite to form more conductive  channels.  \n\nWe further demonstrate programmable FET prototypes  which display similarity to traditional flash memory via  employing   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
