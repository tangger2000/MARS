Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

As illustrated in Figure 4b, compared with the pure IL–Ni– Cl, the   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   hybridized materials demonstrated significantly  wider solar regulation ability covering a broad range from  500 to   $2500~\\mathrm{nm}$  . A   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   up to   $26.5\\%$   was achieved when such  composite system was heated to   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.$  . Meanwhile, the   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$   at  high temperature was maintained at a high level of   $43.9\\%$  . A  color change was observed in the composite from light brown  at   $20~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   to dark green at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , which was attributed to the  combination of IL–Ni–Cl changing from transparent to blue  while   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   remained yellow-brown (Figure 4c).  \n\nA similar approach is to integrate   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   nanoparticles and  NLETS (nickel(II)-based ligand exchange thermo chromic  system), which comprised nickel(II), 2,2-dimethyl propane1,3-diol, and bromide.  This demonstrated a high   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   of   $18.2\\%$   while maintaining a relatively high   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$   of   $68.7\\%$   simultaneously while heated. Thus, hybridization with   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   nanoparticles has been recognized as a promising solution to enhance  the   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   of an ionic liquid–based complex system for energyefficient smart window application.  \n\nThe organic approach hybridizes an ionic liquid–based  complex system with thermo chromic hydrogels, also known  as ionogels or ion gels.  Besides the configuration transformation of ionic liquid–based complex systems, an LCST-type  phase transition occurs between the polymer chains and ionic  liquids at elevated temperatures, leading to a remarkably dist ingui sh able difference in optical transmittance (Figure 4d).  At low temperature, the polymer chains and ionic liquid form  a homogeneous network that has high transparency. Upon  heating, this uniform distribution of polymer chains and ionic  liquid is no longer stable, resulting in the formation of ionic  liquid–rich domains, scattering of incident light, and a change  in optical transmittance.  Figure 4e represents the transmit- tance spectra of ionogel at various temperatures ranging from  15 to   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . With the temperature increase of ionogel, the   $300{-}2200\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   spectral range is affected. As Lee et al. reported,  when the ionogels were heated above the LCST, up to   $80\\%$  luminous modulation   $(\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lum}})$   could be achieved via an observable color change to white (insets of Figure 4e).  Below the  LCST, the   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$   was maintained at   $87\\%$  . Furthermore, the exact  LCST could be manipulated from below zero to over  $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   just  by varying the composition of ionic liquid. The ionogel system  demonstrated high stability, maintaining solar modulation performance after 5000 heating–cooling cycles. Additionally, as  shown in Figure 4f, this ionogel has been successfully adapted  with various organic dyes, which increases its competitiveness  in the commercial smart window market.  \n\n# 2.3. Meta materials  \n\nMeta materials refer to engineered composite materials with  properties that are not found in nature. These properties are  not derived from the source materials themselves, but from  their artificially constructed structures.  Various applications  of meta materials have been developed, including antennae, absorbers,  and cloaking.  Meta materials are also regarded  as one of the competitive candidates for energy-efficient smart  window applications.  \n\nIn order to achieve thermal responsiveness for energy-efficient smart window applications, meta materials could either  be constructed from thermo responsive materials  or from  origami-inspired meta materials  attached to materials that  respond to environmental temperature change, resulting in the  meta material configuration changing spontaneously.  \n\nWhile there appears to be great promise in the application  of thermo responsive meta materials to energy-efficient smart  window applications, this research is still in its early stage, with  limited achievements to date in this field. As one category of  reconfigured meta materials, origami-inspired meta materials  have exhibited considerable potential for smart window application, with dynamically tunable geometry of the patterned cuts  and folds manipulated by external stimuli.  \n\nTang et  al. pioneered a thermo responsive origami-inspired  structure (also known as kirigami) that could be buckled out of  plane to reflect or transmit light in response to a minor change  of local temperature.  The so-called kiri-kirigami structure  was characterized by patterned notches inserted into both sides  of the sheet ( Figure   5 a). These notches acted as geometrical  imperfections of the kirigami structure so that only certain  desirable tilting orientations could be achieved. Furthermore,  the tilting orientation was fully programmable by adjusting the  design of notches, as demonstrated in Figure 5b. By integrating  the thermally shrinkable tape (black) onto the patterned notches  (Figure 5c), a self-foldable bilayer structure formed, relying on  the mismatched deformation between the thermally shrinkable  tape and the kiri-kirigami meta material to spontaneously selftilt upon thermal activation. Upon heating from 24 to   $65\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ,  the tilting orientation changed until it reversed (Figure 5c). By  integration with a reflective coating, the configuration could  change such that it reflected sunlight at elevated temperature  and directed sunlight indoors at low temperature.  \n\nTo evaluate the performance of this kiri-kirigami material, a  testing space was designed with dimensions of   $5200~\\mathrm{mm}$     $(L)\\times$   $3400\\;\\mathrm{~mm~}\\:(W)\\:\\times\\:2300\\;\\mathrm{~mm~}\\:(H)$  , containing three windows,   $2300\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}$     $(L)\\,\\times\\,580\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}$   ( W ) (Figure 5d), each with reflective, thermo responsive meta material structure (Figure 5e).  Figure 5f shows the illumination performance of the base  model without the kiri-kirigami smart windows installed, and  Figure  $5\\mathrm{g}$   shows the illumination performance of the proposed  model with the kiri-kirigami smart windows. Taking an average  day as the example, it was observed that direct penetration of  sunlight decreased dramatically with the kiri-kirigami window.  According to the simulation, using the kiri-kirigami smart windows throughout the year would result in a total saving of   $47\\%$  and  $26\\%$   electricity for cooling and lighting, respectively.  \n\n# 2.4. Per ovsk ites  \n\nPer ovsk ites are materials with an identical crystal structure to  calcium titanium oxide. Among thousands of complex structures, per ovsk ites stand out with numerous interesting properties including chemically mani pula table optical and electrical  properties.  There has been tremendous recent scientific  interest in the development and application of per ovsk ites,  especially for photovoltaics,  lasers,  LED devices,  and  photo electrolysis.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
