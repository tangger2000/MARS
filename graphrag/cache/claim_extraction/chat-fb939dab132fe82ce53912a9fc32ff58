Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Then the pristine   $\\mathsf{P E A}_{x}\\mathsf{P A}_{2-x}(\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3})_{n-1}\\mathsf{P b B r}_{4}$  perovskite  films were obtained by spin-coating the precursor at 3000  rpm for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$   in which   $300~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of toluene was quickly dripped on the substrate  at   $28\\,\\mathrm{~s~}$   after the spin-procedure starting, followed by annealing at   $75\\,\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for   $10\\ \\ m i n$  . For the pristine/ABA per ovsk ites, the precursor  were prepared by adding different concentrations of   $\\mathsf{A B A}_{2}\\mathsf{P b B r}_{4}$   into  the   $\\mathsf{P E A}_{x}\\mathsf{P A}_{2-x}(\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3})_{n-1}\\mathsf{P b B r}_{4}$   solution (e.g.,   $5\\%$   ABA incorporated  perovskite precursor was prepared by adding   $3.75\\times10^{-3}\\texttt{M A B A}_{2}\\mathsf{P b B r}_{4}$  into pristine perovskite precursor).  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The glass/ITO substrates were successively washed  by deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and then further  cleaned with UV-Ozone cleaner for   $20~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The PVK HIL was prepared  by spin-coating the PVK solution   $(4\\,\\mathsf{m g\\,m L^{-1}}$   dissolved in chl oro benzene)  on ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for   $45\\ \\mathsf{s}$  , and then heated at   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $15\\;\\mathsf{m i n}$   before use. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on  PVK substrates for preparation of the perovskite films. Then TPBi, LiF,  and Al electrode were successively evaporated onto the perovskite films  with the thickness of 45, 1, and   $100\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   at deposition rates of 0.5, 0.04,  and  $]\\textrm{\\AA}s^{-1}$  , respectively. After completion of the device fabrication, the  devices were sealed by an ultraviolet-curable resin before testing.  \n\nCharacterization : UV–vis absorption spectra were performed with  the spectrophotometer of PERSEE TU-1901. X-ray diffraction analysis  was carried on X-ray diffract o meter (Bruker Advance D8 Ew Germany)  with   $\\mathsf{C u}^{\\mathrm{~\\tiny~K~}\\alpha}$  radiation. The morphology of perovskite films and the  cross-sectional SEM characterization were performed on the scanning  electron microscope (Zeiss 1550). The XPS measurements were carried  out with Kratos Ultra Spectrometer equipped with mono chroma ti zed  Al   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$   X-ray photons discharge lamp. The UPS analysis was carried out  using a KRATOS ULTRA AXIS DLD photoelectron spectroscopy system  with an unfiltered He I (21.22  eV) gas-discharge lamp. AFM images  were measured with use of the atomic force microscope of NanoScope  III (Digital Instrument). The PLQY were recorded by the equipment of  Hamamatsu Quantaurus-QY, model no. C11347. TA spectroscopy was  conducted using an ExciPro XL Femtosecond Transient Absorption  Pump-Probe Spectrometer (CDP systems). The perovskite films were  pumped with a femtosecond   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   laser pulse generated from an  optical parametric amplifier. The probe pulses ranging from 380 to   $800\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   were derived from the fundamental   $800\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   laser pulses with  a small portion   $(\\approx\\!5~\\upmu)$   of a   $2\\ m m$   thick   $\\mathsf{C a F}_{2}$   plate.

The timeresolved photo luminescence was conducted by a time-corrected single  photon counting (TCSPC, PicoHarp 300E) module equipped with a  photomultiplier (PMA-C 192-M) detector. The capacitance–voltage ( C – V )  measurement was carried out with use of Keithley 4200A parameter  analyzer at   $\\rceil\\downarrow\\mathsf{k}\\mathsf{H}\\boldsymbol{z}$   and   $30~\\mathsf{m V}$   AC amplitude. The tDOS experiment was  performed using Keithley 4200A parameter analyzer with the frequency  range from  $10^{3}$   to   $10^{7}\\ {\\mathsf{H}}z$   and  $25\\textsf{m V A C}$   amplitude. The  t DOS   $\\left(N_{\\top}\\right)$   can  be derived from the angular frequency dependent capacitance with the  equation:   $N_{\\top}=-\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{bi}}}{q w}\\frac{{\\sf d}C}{{\\sf d}\\omega}\\frac{\\omega}{k_{\\tt B}T}$  , where   $C$   is the capacitance,   $\\omega$   is the angular  \n\nfrequency,   $q$   is the elementary charge,   $k_{8}$   is the Boltzmann constant,  T is the temperature,   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   is the built-in potential, and   $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{W}}$  is the depletion  width, respectively. The current density–voltage–luminance curves were  obtained from Ocean Optics system equipped with a Keithley 2400 source  meter, an integrating sphere (FOIS-1), and an QE Pro spectrometer.  The integrating sphere was calibrated with a radiometric calibration  light source (HL-3plus) before use. The active area for the devices is   $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$  . The EQEs of perovskite LEDs are obtained by measuring the light  intensity in the forward direction by placing the devices on the top of the  integrating sphere. The scanning rate is   $0.5\\ \\vee\\ s^{-1}$   with a dwell time of   $].5\\textsf{s}$  . The device performances are crosschecked at University of Hong  Kong (W. C. group) and Southern University of Science and Technology  (K. W. group) to show the reliable result. The CIE coordinates of the  devices were obtained from LED Color Calculator (OSRAM).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis research was supported by Equipment fund, Platform Research  Fund and feed fund (Grant Nos. 2019157209, 201511159225, and  201811159147), from the University Grant Council of the University of  Hong Kong, the General Research Fund (Grant Nos. 17211220, 17204117,  and 17200518) from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China,  as well as 2019 B 121205001 from Department of Science and Technology  of Guangdong Province, National Science Foundation (NSF) of China \n\n (No. 61875082), National Key Research and Development Program \n\n (No. 2017 Y FE 0120400), and NSF of Guangdong Province (No.  2017 B 030306010).
