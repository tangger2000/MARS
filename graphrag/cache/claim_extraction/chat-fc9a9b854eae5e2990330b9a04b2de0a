Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Similarly, Kamarudin et  al. enhanced  the stability of   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.98}\\mathrm{EDA}_{0.01}\\mathrm{SnI}_{3}$   by Lewis base posttreatment.  Ethane-1,2-diamine (edamine) was diluted in Ph-Cl  at various concentration and the solution was spin-coated  on perovskite film. The increment of open-circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   was contributed by the suppression of tin oxidation and  stabilization of under-coordinated   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  . The PCE of the device  with post treatment even increased to   $10.18\\%$   after 7 days of  storage in the glovebox.  \n\n# 2.3. Additives to Enhance Device Performance and Stability  \n\nAs mentioned above, tin halide per ovsk ites suffer from the  easy ox i diz ation of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$   to   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   in the presence of oxygen,  while leads to the formation of   $\\mathrm{Sn}$   vacancies and thus self  p-type doping. Extra   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   compensation such as   $\\mathrm{SnX}_{2}$     $(\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Cl}$  and F) can help reduce the loss of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$  . These tin halides not  only postpone the ox i diz ation process but also improve the film  quality. In addition to   $\\mathrm{SnX}_{2}$  , other additives can be added as  well to regulate the film morphology.  \n\nIn 2019, Yan et  al. demonstrated that they could fabricate  air-stable devices by employing hydroxy benzene sulfonic acid  or its salt as an antioxidant to combine with excess   $\\mathrm{5nCl_{2}}$  . Figure    4 a shows the molecular structures of the three  representative additives used in this work, including phenol  sulfonic acid (PSA), 2-aminophenol-4-sulfonic acid (APSA), and  the potassium salt of hydro quin one sulfonic acid (KHQSA).  The interaction between   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$   and the sulfonate group guaranteed the long-term stability of tin halide per ovsk ites. In  Figure 4b, it exhibits the difference between the process with  or without addictives. The   $\\mathrm{5nCl_{2}}$  –additive complex layer, which  formed in the presence of the sulfonate group, helped the  devices maintain   $80\\%$   of the PCE over  $500\\textrm{h}$   in the air without  any encapsulation. In Figure  4c, the KHQSA-PSC showed a  stabilized PCE of   $6.6\\%$   within 1200 s maximum power point  tracking, while the pristine PSC degraded gradually from the  initial PCE of   $3.3\\%$   to   $2.8\\%$  . Without encapsulation in   $20\\%$   RH  air, the average PCE of the KHQSA-PSCs was maintained over   $80\\%$   of its initial PCE for more than  $500\\;\\mathrm{h}$   (Figure 4d).  \n\nIn another study, Islam et  al. employed hydra z in i um chloride   $(\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5}\\mathrm{Cl})$   as a co-additive to hinder the ox i diz ation process  of   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   to   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  .  This phenomenon can be explained by the  following reductive reaction:   $2\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}\\rightarrow2\\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\\mathrm{N}_{2}+\\mathrm{H}_{2}+\\mathrm{e}^{-}$  .  Due to the strong reducing property,   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   can easily release  electrons to suppress the appearance of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  . To evaluate the  influence of   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5}\\mathrm{Cl}$  , the authors prepared   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   solutions  with only   $\\mathrm{SnF}_{2}$   and with   $\\mathrm{SnF}_{2}{+}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5}\\mathrm{Cl}$   to observe the changes  in ambient air. After   $2\\textup{h}$   of aging, the ox i diz ation signal began  to appear. As shown in Figure  4e, the solution containing  both additives remained light yellow, while the solution with  only   $\\mathrm{SnF}_{2}$   turned dark red, indicating the different rates of  ox i diz ation. Without encapsulation, the best device retained   $65\\%$   of its initial PCE after   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$  of storage in nitrogen   $\\left(\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\right)$   \n\n (Figure 4f). Besides, Li et al. utilized tri hydrazine di hy dr iodide \n\n (THDH) as an additive for solution deposition of   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  .   This additive could not only provide full surface coverage and  smooth morphology but also inhibit the rapid ox i diz ation of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$  . With   $3\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\%$   THDH, the PCE increased to   $8.51\\%$  . By  observing the color change of different precursor solutions, oxidization can be inhibited by the presence of THDH.  \n\n# 3. Mixed Pb–Sn Halide Perovskite Solar Cells  \n\n# 3.1. Bowing Effect of Mixed Pb–Sn Halide Per ovsk ites  \n\nWith the decreased   $x$  value in   $\\mathrm{\\MAPb}_{x}\\mathrm{Sn}_{1-x}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  , the valence  band (VB) and conduction band (CB) both undergo a  energy shift, from   $-5.45$   and   $-3.90\\,\\mathrm{~eV~}$     $(x\\,=\\,1.0)$  ) to   $-5.47$    and   $-4.17\\,\\mathrm{~eV}$   $(x\\,=\\,0)$  ), respectively ( Figure    5 a).  The relatively larger shift of CB brings about the narrower bandgap  of tin-riched per ovsk ites. Here, an abnormal phenomenon  called bowing effect is observed for bandgap tuning,   where the trend of the bandgaps appears like a bowing and  the narrowest bandgap is achieved with Sn ratio around   $60\\%$    (Figure  5b,c). Figure  5b shows the bandgaps from the Tauc  plot and the photo luminescence (PL) as a function of the   $\\mathrm{Sn}$    ratio. The electronic structure, which is calculated by the first  principle, indicates that the Pb and Sn atoms are ordered  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/33d323d69c522e388778b586799c08d1f6b6a3419a75f10239e7f368a18a93fb-1723835202.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $\\\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
