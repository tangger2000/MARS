Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The transition from HRS to LRS requires  much larger voltage after enlarging the sweeping range. For  the sweep voltage range of 0–4, 0–5, 0–6, and   $_{0-7\\ \\mathrm{V},}$   the SET  voltage increases from 1.3, 2.3, 4.5 to  $5.5\\;\\mathrm{V}.$   The similar trend is  observed during the RESET process in which the LRS switched  to HRS at  − 1.3,  $-2.7$  ,  $-4.6$  , and − 5.8 V, respectively.  \n\nWe then systematically performed a series of controlling  tests to study the switching mechanism of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based  photonic memory device in air. Figure   $2\\mathrm{f}$  depicts the memory  performance with respect to the thickness of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$     $\\mathrm{QDs}^{\\prime}$    arrays. The RRAM device fabricated on thinner   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs’  arrays exhibits an unstable resistive switching performance  while the RRAM device fabricated on thicker  ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   requires  larger voltage to be turned on. Thus, the following electrical  performance and photo response were mainly investigated on  RRAM device fabricated from the medium concentration of   $0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\:mg\\mL^{-1}\\ C s P b B r_{3}}$   QDs’ solution due to its high stability  and lower power consumption. Figure   $2\\mathrm{g}$   displayed the SET/ RESET functionality as the dependence of compliance current   $\\left(I_{\\mathrm{CC}}\\right)$  . The SET and RESET voltages of the RRAM device display a significant fluctuation by varying  $I_{\\mathrm{CC}}$   from   $10^{-1}$   to   $10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}$  .  In the metal filament-based RRAM device, the formation/rupture of conductive filaments corresponds to the SET/RESET  operation, which is primarily dominated by the external electric  field and current-induced Joule heat, whereas that of vacancy  conductive filaments is governed by both redox reaction and  current-induced thermal activation. Higher compliance current  induces the formation of thicker filament and subsequently  harder rupture process; thus, increased SET and RESET voltages are observed in the high   $I_{\\mathrm{CC}}$   level situation. In addition,  Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows the relationship  between the sweep rate and the switching voltage. Obviously,  due to the generation of large Joule heat and more conductive  filaments, the resistance change becomes more complicated in  the dense sweep rate of   $0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . The intermediate resistance  state occurs during the SET process, suggesting the formation  of “netlike” filament structure. SET and RESET voltage values  become larger when the dense sweep rate is applied.  \n\nIt is worthwhile to note that PMMA layers are incorporated  in the sandwich structured memory due to its extraordinary  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/455a2a8a7589ecc310e6b5449e3e27aa3e19e9d354e44a7c51aaf98fa6c20510-1727117119.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   a) Schematic illustration of the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QD-based RRAM device fabrication via all-solution process. b) AFM image of the topography of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs’ arrays with the height profile of the surface. c) Cross-sectional SEM image showing the side view of the Ag/PMMA/  $\\mathsf{\\Gamma}\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs/PMMA/ ITO device. d) Typical current–voltage ( I–V)  plot of the device; inset is the photograph of the as-prepared device. e)  I–V  characteristics with different  sweeping voltage ranges. f) Concentration-dependent   $I{-}V$  plots.

To study the stability  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based photonic RRAM, the resistive switching  behavior of the   $\\mathrm{ITO/Cs P b B r}_{3}/\\mathrm{Ag}$   structured reference device  was measured under the same circumstance for comparison.  As shown in Figures S3 and S4 (Supporting Information),  obvious damages of anode electrode can be observed in ITO/  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{Ag}$   device after five sweeping cycles, and the device  exhibits unstable resistive switching behavior. However, there  is almost no damage in attacking the anode in ITO/PMMA/  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}/\\mathrm{Ag}$   structured device after 5000 cycles, as the  transition between LRS and HRS is stable. When the charge  carriers are injected into the memory device, morphological  changes in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs’ layer, and reaction in the interface between the  ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs’ layer and the Ag electrode may  occur. After introducing the PMMA protection layer between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs and electrode, the beneficial interface passivation of the trap state in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs’ layer is obtained to  modify the contact between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs’ layer and electrodes,  which guarantees the stable resistive switching of ITO/PMMA/  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}/\\mathrm{Ag}$  device. The bending experimental results  are presented in Figure 2h. The current ratio between HRS  and LRS could be maintained at   ${\\approx}6\\times10^{5}$   during the alternative  positive/negative sweeps. To clarify possible principles of conduction behavior, positive part of the   $I{-}V$   curves was fitted with  various theories. As displayed in Figure 2i, the results suggest  that the conduction in the HRS region can be interpreted  into three segments including mechanism Ohmic conduction   $(I\\propto\\,V)$  , space-charge-limited current (SCLC) obeying the Child  law   $(I\\propto V^{2})$  , and trap-free SCLC (  $.I\\propto\\,V^{n}$  ,   $n>2$  ).  \n\nNext, we assessed the photonic memory's response to the  optical signal, and the illustration of experimental setup is  shown in  Figure   3 a. It should be worth noting that the capability of more exciton harvesting and fast exciton separation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}\\,\\mathrm{QCs}$   can potentially induce the facile coupled electronic  and photonic memory devices.
