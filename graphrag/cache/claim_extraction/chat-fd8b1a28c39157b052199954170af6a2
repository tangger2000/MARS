Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The large  covering area of color coordinates also indicates great potential  application in vivid wide color gamut displays. Considering the  photo stability and thermo stability are important for practical PL  applications, we put   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composites under continuous  UV-light (emission:   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  ; power: 16 W; window area:   $4\\;\\mathrm{{cm}\\times}$   $19\\ \\mathrm{cm}$  ; irradiation distance:   $15\\ \\mathrm{cm}$  ) irradiation for   $15\\mathrm{~d~}$   to test  their photo stability. Since the network density of polymer  chains may affect the photo stability, the cross linking degree of   $6\\%/12\\%/18\\%$   PS beads was tested in this experiment, respectively. From Figure S8 (Supporting Information) described above,  all composites exhibit better photo stability to some extent compared with bare PQDs. The thermal behavior of the composites  was further studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)  and thermo grav i metric (TG) techniques. As shown in Figure S9  (Supporting Information), the sharp endothermic peak on  $135~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    was observed in the DSC curve (dashed line in blue) that attributed to the glass transition of pure cross linking PS spheres. In  comparison, the glass transition of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composites got  a relative broad temperature range from 100 to   $190~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (solid line  in blue), which suggests that the interaction between PQDs and  PS microspheres greatly influences the thermal movements of  chain segments. Compared with the un cross linked PS latex got a  glass trans is tion temperature at about   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and melting point  of   $270\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ,  the composites present high thermal resistant  property owing to the fact that cross linked PS are infusible.  \n\nDespite numerous efforts in improving stability of perovskite,  the highly luminescent nanohybrid PQDs still quenched most  of their emission when being immersed into water.  In comparison with porous materials, polymer chains encompass the  nano crystals compactly, which endows the composite excellent  water resistant property. We stirred the composite in water for   $3\\ \\mathrm{d}.$  . Then the composite was separated from water by a Büchner  funnel and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature. The  absolute PL QYs of composites were   $64.7\\%$  , while the luminescence of bare nano crystals was completely quenched owing to  irreversible degradation. It is very surprising that the   $\\mathrm{PODs}_{\\mathcal{Q}\\mathrm{PS}}$    composites still emitted strong green luminescence even after  nine-month storage in water. The photo luminescence spectra  were measured to monitor the intensity of fluorescence. It is  worth noting that in order to eliminate the instrumental error  from spectrophotometer, a certain concentration of rhodamine B  aqueous solution was used as reference (stored in dark) for each  measurement. The sample of aqueous solution was sonicated  for   $10\\ \\mathrm{min}$   before testing to ensure the homogeneity. As shown  in  Figure   5 a, the composite remains   $20–30\\%$   intensity of florescence even after   $30\\textup{d}$  of stirring in water according to the different degree of cross linking. The sample with   $12\\%$   cross linking  degree exhibited the best performance for water resistance. It is  surprising that the water resistance of   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composites  demonstrated a size-dependent effect. 400 and 800 nm   $\\operatorname{PODs}(\\emptyset)$  PS beads show rapid luminescence quenching in aqueous solution. This may be attributed to the distribution of PQDs in PS  particles. It is reasonable to speculate a large proportion of  nano crystals located in periphery of small-size PS beads, which  leads to poor waterproof property. In addition, increasing the  dosage of PS making little difference with the loading amount of  PQDs for PS spheres, their PL spectra (Figure S10, Supporting  Information) also show similar water resistant property. Therefore, a large-scale production (about   $6.2~\\mathrm{g}.$  ,  Figure   6 ) with superior water resistant property can be obtained in one batch.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/8201d6fa89aea0f49df6c39df539fc70ff4e8017ab857980ac6bf926a729060a-1727077239.jpg)  \nFigure 6.   a) Preparation of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}\\mathrm{@P S}$   composites in large scale.
