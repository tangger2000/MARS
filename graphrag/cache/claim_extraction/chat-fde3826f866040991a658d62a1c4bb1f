Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The  $\\nu_{5}$  , which relates to the   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}/T a^{5+}}$   cation displacement and   $(\\mathrm{Nb,Ta})\\mathrm{O}_{6}$   octahedra tilting,  is found to become weakened in  intensity and broad in shape with increasing Ta addition. The  decrease in intensity is attributed to the lower polar iz ability  of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}~(2.82~\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}^{3})$   compared to that of   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$     $(3.10\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^{3})$  ,  while  the broadening may relate to the reduction in the correlation  length of displacements. This can be explained by the lower  electronegativity of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   (1.5) than that of   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$   (1.6),  where  the substitution of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   for   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$   will result in stronger ionic  bonding and compressed oxygen octahedron s, accounting  for the decreased correlation length of displacements. The  enhanced ionic bonding in the octahedron s also leads to lattice contraction as confirmed by X-ray diffract o meter (XRD)  patterns in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), where [020],  [220], [134], [314] peaks and [114], [008] peaks show opposite  trends with the addition of Ta. More information about the  XRD patterns can be seen in Supporting Information. Based  on the SAED images and Raman spectra, the enhanced antiferro electricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics can be explained,  being attributed to the reduced average polar iz ability of B-site  cations.  \n\nIn summary, a recoverable energy density of   $4.2~\\mathrm{J~cm^{-3}}$   with   $260\\%$   enhancement over the pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramic, and good  thermal stability of energy storage density with minimal variation   $(\\pm5\\%)$   over temperature range of   ${20}–{120}~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  have been  achieved in Ta-modified   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics. It is found that Ta  modification leads to decreased grain size and increased bulk  density, benefiting the dielectric breakdown strength. Further  investigations reveal that the incorporation of Ta to Nb site can  enhance the anti ferro electricity of   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics  owing to the reduced polar iz ability of B-site cations, which can  be confirmed by the polarization hysteresis, dielectric tunability,  selected-area electron diffraction and Raman measurements.  Both the enhanced dielectric breakdown strength and antiferro electricity contribute to the improved energy storage performance in Ta-modified  $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics, making   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{1-x}T a_{x})}$   $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   solid solution a promising lead-free candidate for dielectric  energy storage applications.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nFabrication of   $A g(N b_{\\mathit{1-x}}T a_{x})O_{3}$   Ceramics :   $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{1-x}\\mathsf{T a}_{x})\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   ceramics  (abbreviated as ANT x ,   $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}$  is 0, 5, 10, 15, and   $20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu}\\circ\\mathrm{\\textperthousand}$  , respectively)  were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction method using   $\\mathsf{A g}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$     $({\\geq}99.7\\%)$  ,  $\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{5}$     $(\\geq\\!99.99\\%)$  , and  $\\mathsf{T a}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{5}$     $(\\geq\\!99.99\\%)$   as the raw materials.  These oxide powders were mixed by using a planetary ball mill with  anhydrous ethanol at 250 rpm for   $24~\\mathsf{h}$  , in a nylon jar with zirconia ball  media. The dried powder mixture was pressed into disks with   $20~\\mathsf{m m}$    in diameter and   $2\\ m m$  in thickness and calcined at   $900~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $6~\\mathsf{h}$   in   $\\mathsf{O}_{2}$   atmosphere. The calcined powders were milled again and pressed  into disks of   $8\\ \\mathsf{r m m}$   in diameter and   $1.2~\\mathsf{m m}$   in thickness, followed by  cold isostatic pressing under 220 MPa for   $1.5~\\mathrm{min}$  . The compacted  powders were sintered at   $\\mathsf{T}\\,\\mathsf{T}00\\ \\mathrm{°C}$   for   $6~\\mathsf{h}$   in   ${\\sf O}_{2}$   atmosphere to prevent  the possible decomposition of the silver oxide at high temperature.  \n\nCharacterization of Phase, Micro structure, and Electrical Properties :  The density of the sintered pellets was determined by the Archimedes  method. XRD (D8 Advance A25, Bruker, Germany) with monochromatic   $\\textsf{C u}\\textsf{K a}$  radiation   $(\\lambda\\,=\\,\\mathsf{I}\\,.5405\\,\\mathrm{\\AA})$  ) was used to determine the phase  structure. The micro structure of the sintered samples was examined by  field emission scanning electron microscopy (Merlin VP compact Zeiss,  Germany). SAEDs and HREM investigations were performed using an  FEI TECNAI   $\\mathsf{G}^{2}20$   TEM with a double tilting stage, operating at   $200~\\mathrm{kV}.$  Samples for TEM experiments were prepared by mechanical polishing  followed by Ar-ion beam milling to reach electron transparency, which  was carried out using a Gatan PIPS 695 system, with Ar-ion beams  operating at   $0.1\\mathrm{-}4~\\mathrm{kV}.$   The pellets were polished down to a thickness of   $200~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   and coated with   $\\mathsf{A g}$   electrode at   $600~^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}/0.5~\\mathsf{h}$   for high electric  field measurements. The hysteresis loops were measured with a  ferroelectric measurement system at   $1\\ \\mathsf{H}\\mathsf{z}$   (aixACCT TF Analyzer 1000,  Germany). The values of breakdown strength can be evaluated by:  \n\n$$\nX_{i}\\!=\\!\\mathsf{I n}\\big(E_{i}\\big)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{Y_{i}=\\mathsf{I n}\\Big\\{\\mathsf{I n}\\big[\\mathsf{I}/\\big(\\mathsf{I}-P_{i}\\big)\\big]\\Big\\}}}\\\\ {~~}\\\\ {{P_{i}=i/\\big(\\mathsf{n}+\\mathsf{I}\\big)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  $n$   is the total number of samples,   $E_{i}$   is the breakdown electric field  for the  i th specimen arranging in ascending order, and   $\\mathsf{P}_{i}$  the probability  of dielectric breakdown.   $X_{i}$   and   $Y_{j}$   should have a linear relationship.  The capacitance-voltage was measured at   $\\rceil00\\ {\\mathsf{H z}}$   and direct current of   $300~\\lor$   over the temperature range   ${20}{-100}~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   using aixACC TF Analyzer  1000 (aixACCT TF Analyzer 1000, Germany).
