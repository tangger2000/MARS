The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films have absorption onset at   ${\\approx}650\\ \\mathrm{\\nm}$   (1.9 eV),  which is consistent with the reported results.  The thicknesses of the two kinds of films are carefully controlled to be  same (Figure  3c,d). A significant increase in absorbance is  observed for the film with DMSO adducts over the entire absorption range, which is due to its higher crystal lin it y (Figure  S3,  Supporting Information). To quantitatively analyze the influence  of DMSO adducts on the trap density of a   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, capacitor-like devices that sandwich the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films between  $\\mathrm{FTO}/\\AA$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{PCBM}/\\mathrm{Ag}$   are fabricated and are characterized by the  evolution of the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) at different  biases (Figure 5b). The current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   curves rise  sharply at the trap-filled limit (TFL) voltage, where all of the trap  defects are occupied by electrons. The trap density is calculated  according to the equation   $N_{\\mathrm{trap}}=2\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}/e d^{2}\\L_{,}^{[20]}$   where   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   and  ε  are the vacuum permittivity and the dielectric constant of the \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, respectively,   $d$   is the thickness of the prepared \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, and   $e$   is the elementary charge. The trap densities   $N_{\\mathrm{trap}}$   are calculated to be   $3.64\\times10^{15}$   and   $1.94\\times10^{16}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  for the   $\\dot{\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}}$   films with and without DMSO adducts, respectively. The defect density is substantially decreased in the CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with DMSO adducts, which can be attributed to its  high crystal lin it y obtained through the slow growth process.  \n\nTo investigate the influence of DMSO adducts on photogenerated charge carriers in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films, the steady-state  photo luminescence (PL) spectra are recorded (Figure 5c). The  PL intensity of the perovskite film prepared with DMSO adducts  is much higher than that of the control film, suggesting a significantly reduced non radiative recombination rate within the  perovskite film. Moreover, a small blue shift can be observed  for the PL peak of the sample with DMSO adducts (Figure 5c).  This implies a lower trap density of the film near the bandedge, therefore, reduced recombination loss and improved  photo current collection in the film with DMSO adducts can be  expected. The PL decay lifetimes of the films are determined by  time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements (Figure  5d; Table S1,  Supporting Information). The decay curves can be well fitted  with exponential components. The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with DMSO  adducts shows a much longer lifetime (11.6 ns) than that of the  control film (1.7 ns). The prolonged PL decay time of the CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film is the result of suppressed non radiative recombination channels in the perovskite film.  In summary, compared  to the control film, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with DMSO adducts  results in higher photo luminescence intensity and longer PL  lifetimes, indicating that the improved crystalline quality can  significantly reduce the defect density and non radiative recombination and prolong the lifetimes of carriers.  \n\nTo examine the effect of DMSO adducts on the photo­ voltaic  performance, an inorganic PSC with the structure   $\\mathrm{FTO/TiO}_{2}/$   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}/$ Spiro-OMeTAD/Au is fabricated. Figure  6a shows the   $J{-}V$  curves for PSCs based on the control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    film. The device displays a low PCE of   $11.36\\%$   with   $J_{S C}$   of   $14.72\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  of   $1.14\\mathrm{~V~}$   and fill factor (FF) of   $67.55\\%$  .

When the surface of a  film is rough, it is easier for a water droplet to sit on the surface  and be absorbed, but the process becomes harder as the surface  smoothness increases. Thus, the perovskite films with DMSO  adducts are water-resistive and do not allow moisture to easily  attack the perovskite, which is better for the stability of PSCs.  \n\nThe light absorption properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films prepared  with and without DMSO adducts are shown in  Figure 5 a.
