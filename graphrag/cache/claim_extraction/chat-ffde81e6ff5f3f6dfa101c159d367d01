Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

During the printing process, the solution was aggregated along the droplet periphery,  which resulted in an in homogeneous distribution of the material by the coffee ring effect. Subsequently, after the complete  solvent evaporation at room temperature, the continuous  thin perovskite film would be formed in a parallel structure  comprising   $\\mathrm{{Au}/C s P b B r_{3}/A u}$   (see Figure  1c). From the micro  photo luminescence (PL) mapping image shown in Figure 1d,  we can see that the  ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   perovskite film with high PL intensity was more uniform than the spin-coated one. Due to the  wet t ability difference between Au electrodes and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   surface,  the droplets tend to spread on the substrate in different contact  angles, leading to the thickness difference across the film on Au  and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  . To confirm the detailed morphology of the as-printed  perovskite film, the topography and thickness of the perovskite  film were investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM), as  shown in Figure 1e. It is found that the thickness of the film is  around   $20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   and the surface roughness is around   $4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  . More  importantly, we can also integrate the X-ray detector arrays onto  a 4 inch large   $\\mathrm{{SiO}_{\\mathrm{{2}}}/\\mathrm{{Si}}}$   wafer substrate (Figure  1b) to realize  the development of advanced next-generation op to electronic  devices.  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs were synthesized by a well-developed hot  injection method (see the Experimental Section) carrying out  on a standard Schlenk line.  To characterize the crystal structure and micro structure of perovskite QDs, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  were performed. Figure 1f shows the XRD results of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs deposited on a glass substrate. The inset of Figure  1f  shows the typical crystal structure of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   perovskite,  comprising corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{6}$   octahedra with   $C s^{+}$  ions  filling the voids in between. From the XRD patterns, three  dominant diffraction peaks at   $15^{\\circ}$  ,   $21.5^{\\circ}$  , and   $30.5^{\\circ}$  , which  can be assigned to the (100), (110), and (200) facets, respectively, demonstrated the cubic perovskite crystal structure of  the  Pm3m    $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs. Additionally, TEM was performed to  identify the structural characteristics of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs. The  mono disperse   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   exhibited a cubic shape in Figure   $_{1\\mathrm{g}}$  with an average edge length around   $10~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  . The phase structure of the as-synthesized QDs can be further identified by  high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)  image of single   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD. It can be observed in Figure 1h  that these QDs possess inter planar distance of   ${\\approx}0.58\\ \\mathrm{\\nm}$  ,  which is consistent with the lattice space of (100) plane of the   $\\alpha$  phase   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  .  \n\nThe optical properties of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD solution and film  are further investigated by utilizing the ultraviolet–visible  (UV–vis) absorption and PL spec tros copies. The film was produced by directly drop casting the QDs solution on a glass substrate. The comparison of the UV–vis absorption and PL spectra  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs in solution and film are shown in Figure  1i.  The as-synthesized perovskite QDs exhibit band-edge absorption  approaching the bulk optical bandgap of   $2.3\\;\\mathrm{eV},$   which is similar  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/e750dee6f7e1e844954bb3fef6684e66b260a62afca324189cfb5e38ac704756-1727124721.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Characterization of per ovsk ites. a) Schematic illustration of the key fabrication procedures for perovskite-based devices via inkjet printing.  b) Photography of X-ray detector arrays on 4 inch wafer. c) Optical image of device with printed QDs film.

Furthermore, the  perovskite QDs film shows an absorption edge at  $483\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   while  the PL peak of the perovskite film is located at   $510\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . There  exists a small red shift   $(\\approx\\!7\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   in the PL spectrum of the film  compared to that of solution. The QDs with similar size selfassemble together and pack more closely during the film formation. Thereby, the emissions from the small particles, which  have larger energy and smaller wavelength, would have a high  chance of being absorbed by the larger particles, resulting the  PL spectrum of the film redshifted. The PL spectrum is a good  Gaussian curve and its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is   ${\\approx}25\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , giving high-purity green emission. No sub-bandgap  emission was observed in these PL spectra, indicating the pure  phase of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs both in solution and film.  \n\nTo study the detection performance, we expose our device  under the synchrotron soft X-ray beamline with photon energies ranging from 0.1 to   $2.5~\\mathrm{keV}.$    Figure   2 a is the schematic of  an experimental setup used for the soft-X-ray-induced photocurrent measurements at the soft-X-ray beamline in Australian  Synchrotron. Contrary to a conventional X-ray beam, synchrotron radiation is highly collimated with large photon flux, excellent energy resolution, and controlled dose rates.  The actual  dose rate of the X-ray radiation exposure to the sample was  measured by a Radcal dosimeter (see the Experimental Section)  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/d48981ac6927e168990dea535caaa8608c9cdbc3801db685c82f8d2b6c68c3\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
