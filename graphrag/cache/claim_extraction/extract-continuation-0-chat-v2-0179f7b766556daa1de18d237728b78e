Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Compared with the control device, FAAc device showed  a larger   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   and   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{cc}},$   and smaller   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}}$  , which further indicated  more efficient carrier extraction and transport in FAAc devices.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn conclusion, by regulating the crystallization process of tin  perovskite films with FAAc, the oxidation of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$   was effectively hindered. The results of FTIR and Urbach energy showed  that FAAc had a strong coordination ability with   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$  with  enhanced lattice stability, thus delivering reduced lattice distortion and suppressed  $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   oxidation. Moreover, the clusters with  larger colloid sizes can be formed in the precursor solution with  FAAc, which can reduce the nucleation density and slow down  the crystallization rate by combining with strong coordination  ability. Benefiting from the enhanced film quality, the FAAc  films showed low trap density and non-radiative recombination  loss and further promoted the collection and transmission of  carriers of corresponding devices. Finally, the corresponding  devices achieved an excellent PCE of   $12.43\\%$   with excellent stability. After aging for   $2000\\mathrm{~h~}$   in the   $\\Nu_{2}$   glove box, it still maintained   $94\\%$   of the initial PCE. In short, this work sheds light  on the pursuit of more efficient and stable lead-free photovoltaics by regulating the crystallization process and suppressing  unwanted oxidation.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nS.W., H.Y., and W.Z. contributed equally to this work.
