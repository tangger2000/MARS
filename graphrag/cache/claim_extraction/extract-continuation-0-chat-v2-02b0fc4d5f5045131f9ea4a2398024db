Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The performance enhancement was  tentatively attributed to the improved film morphology and the  passivated grain boundaries achieved by the dual functions of  the DPSI molecules. The   $J{-}V$  curve in Figure  3a and the sta­ tistical result in Figure  S5 (Supporting Information) show  that further increasing DPSI concentration to   $0.1\\%$   severely  reduced the   $J_{S C},\\ V_{O C},$  , and FF, and the  $J{-}V$  curve, which indi­ cates that the device with excess DPSI possesses high series  resistance   $(R_{S},\\ 1494.9\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   that decreases the   $J_{S C}$   and FF.  The   $R_{S}$   for the device without DPSI is   $78.4~\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  . The under­ lying reason for the bad performance of the device with excess  DPSI may because the increased thickness of the insulating  layer surrounding the perovskite grains reduced electron tun­ neling rate.

As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Infor­ mation), the statistics PCE values of 40 devices demonstrate the  reproducibility and reliability of the performance enhancement  by introducing of DPSI.  \n\nWe examined the stability of un encapsulated devices stored  in the dark in a glove box filled with nitrogen as well as encap­ sulated devices under AM 1.5G illumination in ambient con­ dition. It was found that the devices maintained almost their  original efficiency when stored in the nitrogen-filled glove box  in the dark for   $2880\\ \\mathrm{h}$   (4 months) (Figure 3e). The initial PV  parameters for the device with DPSI are a  $J_{S C}$   of  $22.6\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,  a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.12\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{V}}$   an FF of   $79.4\\%$  , and a PCE of   $20.1\\%$  . The  PV parameters of the device after   $2880\\ \\mathrm{h}$   storage are a   $J_{S C}$   of \n\n  $23.1~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.15~\\mathrm{V},$  , an FF of   $75.3\\%$  , and a PCE of \n\n  $20.0\\%$  . The real application requires perovskite solar cells to  be stable under sun illumination. To evaluate the operational  stability of devices with DPSI, we monitored the   $J{-}V$  charac­ teristics of the encapsulated device under simulated AM 1.5G  illumination without using an ultraviolet filter. The device  with DPSI retained   $88\\%$   of their initial performance after   $480\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$   under continuous AM 1.5G illumination, as shown in  Figure  3f. To convey the moisture stability information, we  monitored the PCE of the un encapsulated device under the \nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
