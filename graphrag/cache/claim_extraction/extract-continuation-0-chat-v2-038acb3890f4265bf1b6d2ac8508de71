Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

This special  hybrid structure with intimate contact and uniformly dispersion  of non precious metal alloys on heteroatom-doped carbon fibers  might be favorable for achieving excellent electro catalytic performances for the ORR and OER processes as oxygen catalysts.  \n\nIn order to evaluate the ORR/OER catalytic activities, the  four catalysts were first loaded onto glassy carbon electrodes for  cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}.$  - or   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated   $0.1~\\mathrm{~M~}$  KOH solution at room temperature without rotation,  respectively.  And the scan rates are all   $50\\;\\mathrm{mV}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . As shown  in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, the four as-prepared materials exhibit no reduction peak in   $\\Nu_{2}$  -saturated KOH  solution, while a distinct reduction peak appeared in   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated KOH solution, which could be attributed to the reduction of   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  . Among the four materials, the   $\\mathrm{NIC}{\\omega}\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}{\\ }2$   shows  apparently the most outstanding catalytic activity for oxygen  reduction, characterized with the most positive onset and peak  potential (see the vertical dashed line), which could be attributed to the suitable loading amount of NiCo alloy nanoparticles, excellent morphology, and novel structure of the hybrid   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}2$   (see SEM and TEM images).  \n\nTo further investigate and compare the catalytic performances of the four synthesized materials, linear sweeping voltammograms (LSVs) were measured in  $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated  $0.1\\ \\mathrm{M\\KOH}$    at a rotating speed of   $1600\\,\\mathrm{\\rpm}$   on rotating disk electrode  from 0.06 to   $0.96~\\mathrm{V}$   (vs RHE: Reversible Hydrogen Electrode)  with the scan rates of   $10\\:\\mathrm{\\mV~\\s^{-1}}$   to reveal the ORR catalytic performance, and the results are exhibited in  Figure   3 a.  The ORR activity of the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   (  $20\\;\\mathrm{\\wt\\%}$   Pt on  Vulcan XC-72, Johnson Matthey) was also measured and  included for better comparison under the same condition.  From Figure 3a, we could see that the limited current density  of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   could not reach to   $-3\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , while the others are  higher than   $-3\\:\\mathrm{\\mA{~}}\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  tials of the NiCo  $\\mathrm{\\Omega}.\\mathrm{\\Omega}@\\mathrm{N}.\\mathrm{C}$   1, N  $\\mathrm{i}\\mathrm{Co@N.C~}\\,2$  , and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}\\,3$    are 0.72, 0.81, and   $0.76\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   (vs RHE) at the current density of   $-3\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  .
