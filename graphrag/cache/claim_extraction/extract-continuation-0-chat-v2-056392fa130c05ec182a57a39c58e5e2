The photocurrent output at the voltage close to the maximum power point  was measured in the ambient air under continuous one sun illumination (with a   $420~\\mathrm{nm}$   cutoff UV filter) at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . It is noted  that the devices were UV encapsulated with a cover glass using  a low-cost epoxy resin under a nitrogen atmosphere (Figure S9,  Supporting Information). Surprisingly, no decay in efficiency  was observed after   $400\\mathrm{~h~}$   of continuous light illumination. The  striking stability might be attributed to the hydrogen bonding  interaction and the antioxidant property of the hydroxy group  by using PVA as the additive in the perovskite layer. As reported  previously, the iodide ions in perovskite materials can migrate  across the perovskite layer and strongly impact the photovoltaic  device operational stability, especially when subjected to external  bias or under light illumination. By introducing PVA molecule  into the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   perovskite film, the strong   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   hydrogen  bonding interaction can hinder unfavorable iodide ions diffusion, resulting in improved operational stability.  \n\nTo investigate the effects of hydrogen bonding interactions on  ion migration, we measured the ions conductivity of the perovskite films by using galva no static direct current method with the  device configuration of   $\\mathrm{ITO/Au}/\\mathrm{FAsn}_{3}$   (with or without   $\\mathrm{PVA})/$  Au (Figure 5b), and the equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 5c.  Upon switching on the current   $(i=1\\;\\mathrm{nA})$  ), the voltage instantaneously reaches a value   $\\left(V_{0}\\right)$  , to which both electronic resistance  $R_{\\mathrm{con}}$  and ionic resistance   $R_{\\mathrm{ion}}$   contribute   $V_{0}=i(R_{\\mathrm{ion}}R_{\\mathrm{ion}}/(R_{\\mathrm{ion}}+R_{\\mathrm{ion}}))$  . By increasing the time, ions are progressively blocked giving  rise to an internal compositional gradient. Finally, the voltage  increases to the saturation voltage   $V_{s}$  . In the saturated region,  only electrons flow (  $(V_{\\mathrm{s}}\\,=\\,i R_{\\mathrm{con}})$  ).  We can calculate the ions  conductivity   $(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ion}})$   and the electrons conductivity   $(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{con}})$   from   $R_{\\mathrm{ion}}$   and   $R_{\\mathrm{con}}$  . The   $\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3}–\\mathrm{PVA}$   film exhibited a   $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ion}}$   of   $0.77\\times10^{-13}\\;\\mathrm{S}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , which is lower than that of pristine   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$    film   $(0.97\\times10^{-13}\\;\\mathrm{S\\;cm}^{-1})$  ). PVA can effectively suppress the ions  migration through decreasing the ions conductivity, which is  related to the strong   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   hydrogen bonding interaction.  Consequently, improved long-term stability was achieved by the  FASnI 3 –PVA PSCs. By further improving the device structure  with the carbon electrode,  longer operational stability might  be achieved for the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA based PSC device, which  might draw broad attention to the science community for the  pursuit of highly stable   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  -based PSCs.  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated an effective approach  to retard the crystalline rate of the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   perovskite by introducing   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   hydrogen bonding interactions. By adding  PVA, the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA PSCs attained higher PCE of   $8.9\\%$   with  significantly improved   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   from 0.55 to   $0.63\\,\\mathrm{~V}.$   More importantly, the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA PSCs exhibited remarkable long-term  stability, with no decay in efficiency after   $400\\,\\textrm{h}$   of operation  at the maximum power point. It is found that the   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$  hydrogen bonding interactions have the effects of introducing  nucleation sites, slowing down the crystal growth, directing the  crystal orientation, reducing the trap states, and suppressing  the iodide ions migration. These results would bridge the  gap between precursor chemistry and defect behavior in the  Sn-based perovskite film, which guides the design of highly  stable and efficient Sn-based PSCs.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nX.M. and J.L. contributed equally to this work.
