Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As shown in Figure  3i, stretching vibrations of   $\\mathrm{C=N}$    and   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   are observed at 1689.48 and   $1636.13\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}}$   for the  pure PBGH film.  Interestingly, the   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/P B G H}$   and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}+$    PBGH complexes exhibit different shifts in this region. The   $\\mathrm{C=N}$   vibration for the pure PBGH film at   $1689.48~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   shifts  to   $1700.00~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   for   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/P B G H}$   complex, which confirms the  interaction of   $\\mathrm{C=N}$   and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  , while the  $\\mathrm{C=N}$   vibration for the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\;+\\;\\mathrm{PBGH}$   complex demonstrates no variations. In contrast, the   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   vibration exhibits negligible variation for the \n\n  $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/P B G H}$   complex at   $1636.13~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , but shifts downward to \n\n  $1628.72\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   after mixing with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , demonstrating the coordination between   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . The  $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$   NMR spectra presented  in Figure S7 (Supporting Information) also convey a similar  information. The stretching vibrations of   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   for the pure  PBGH film appear at 3304 and   $3183\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , and shift to 3327 and   $3213~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  by mixing with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , which is the evidence for the  formation of hydrogen bond   $_{\\mathrm{N-H}\\cdots\\mathrm{I}}$   (Figure S8, Supporting  Information).  \n\nBriefly, as a bridge between the ETL and the perovskite layer,  PBGH not only boosts the conductivity of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film by passivating the defects on its surface, but also has strong interaction with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   in the perovskite precursor film to improve the  perovskite film quality. Hence, it is expected to facilitate the  performance of the PSCs. As presented in  Figure   4 a, the PSCs  with a structure of glass  $\\mathrm{\\#/FTO/SnO_{2}(P B G H)/F A_{0.9}C s_{0.1}P b I_{3}/}$  Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic  and photoelectric performances. The devices were tested under  the standard AM 1.5G illumination, and the photo current density-voltage   $(J-V)$   curves are displayed in Figure 4b. The PBGHmodified devices exhibit a champion PCE of   $24.79\\%$  , with   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  of 1.197  V,   $J_{S C}$   of   $25.02\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , and FF of   $82.76\\%$  . In contrast, the control PSCs show a lower champion PCE of   $22.85\\%$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of 1.167 V,  $J_{S C}$   of   $24.89\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$  , and FF of   $78.69\\%$  . The   $J{-}V$   curves of the PSCs with   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layers coated with PBGH  aqueous solution of different concentrations (0.00, 0.25, 0.50,  1.00, and   $2.00~\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}~\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{L}^{-1})$  ) are plotted in Figure S9 (Supporting  Information), and the related photovoltaic parameters are listed  in Table S6 (Supporting Information). Figure S10 and Table S7  (Supporting Information) display the I–V hysteresis character istics of the control and PBGH-modified devices, demonstrating  the reduced I–V hysteresis after PBGH application. In addition,  as presented in Figure 4c, the integrated   $J_{S C}$   values of the control and PBGH-modified PSCs are 24.85 and   $24.99\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$  ,  respectively, coinciding with the values derived from the   $J{-}V$  curves. Statistical charts of photovoltaic parameters are shown  in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), which reveal that the  values of   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and FF are increased by a large margin after  PBGH modification, bringing a much higher PCE.  \n\nThe stabilized current densities and efficiencies for the  PSCs were tracked for 600 s at the maximum power points. As  plotted in Figure 4d, the stabilized PCE for the PBGH-modified  device is   $24.68\\%$   at   $1.04~\\mathrm{V}$   bias, whereas it is   $22.86\\%$   (at   $0.98~\\mathrm{V}$  bias) for the control device. The stable output results are close  to the values derived from the  $J{-}V$   curves, confirming that the  PBGH modification can improve the device performance. The  dark   $J{-}V$   curves for the control and PBGH-modified devices  are shown in Figure  4e, demonstrating decreased leakage  current after PBGH incorporation. The smaller leakage current is originated from the lower trap density and less carrier  recombination at the buried interface, resulting in increased   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and FF.  Furthermore, according to Mott–Schottky equation   $C^{-2}\\,=\\,2(V_{\\mathrm{bi}}{-}V)/(A^{2}\\mathrm{e}\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathrm{N_{A}})$  , the capacitance-voltage   $\\left(C\\mathrm{-}V\\right)$  curves under dark conditions were measured to investigate the  influence of PBGH for the built-in potential   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{bi}}\\right)$  .
