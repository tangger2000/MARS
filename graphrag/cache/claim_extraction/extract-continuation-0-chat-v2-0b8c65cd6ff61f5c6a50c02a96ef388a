Herein  we fabricated, for the first time, a type of all-carbon-electrode flexible PSCs, in which graphene and CSCNTs served  as front transparent electrode and back electrode, respectively. All-carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs, with and  without   ${}^{2,2^{\\prime},7,7^{\\prime}}$  -tetrakis-( N,N -di $\\cdot p$  -meth oxy phenyl amine)-  ${9,9^{\\prime}}$  -spiro bif luo rene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole conductor, obtained  PCEs of   $11.9\\%$   and   $8.4\\%$  , respectively. Furthermore, all-carbonbased flexible PSCs were found to exhibit superior mechanical  durability. In addition, flexible PSCs also demonstrated considerably enhanced stability compared with the ITO-based flexible  PSCs fabricated with Ag or Au back contacts after continuous  light illumination or thermal stress in air, maintaining over   $90\\%$   of their original PCEs after   $1000\\,\\mathrm{h}$  .  \n\n# 2. Results and Discussion  \n\nFigure   1 a shows the structure of the all-carbon-electrode-based  flexible PSC. The flexible device was fabricated on a graphene/ PET substrate with a regular device configuration. A compact   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   nano crystalline film was deposited on graphene as electron  transport material. [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester  (PCBM) was subsequently spin-coated on the top of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   anode to  prevent current leakage and to aid in electron extraction. CSCNT  film was transferred onto the perovskite layer with the aid of several droplets of diethyl ether. To ensure efficient hole collection,  the hole-transporting material of spiro-OMeTAD was cast into  the device from CSCNTs’ side. Figure 1b shows the energy level  of each layer in the device. Figure 1c shows the representative topsurface scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of graphene/ PET film, which is smooth, continuous, transparent, and flexible.  The graphene/PET films used in this study also show high transmittance and conductivity, for example, for 2-layered graphene  (G2), the sheet resistance and transmittance at the wavelength of   $550\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   are  ${\\approx}290\\pm17\\;\\Omega\\;\\mathrm{sq}^{-1}$   and   $87.3\\%$  , respectively, as shown in  Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.
