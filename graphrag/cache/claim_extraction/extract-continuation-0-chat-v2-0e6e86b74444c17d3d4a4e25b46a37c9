The Rb ions are likely to partially occupy the interstitial sites of the perovskite, which can inhibit ion migration and suppress the mutual reaction of halides. This suggests that RbF plays a role in modifying the perovskite structure and potentially improving its properties.<|>In order to explore whether RbF penetrates into the perovskite, time-of-flight secondary ions mass spectroscopy (ToFSIMS) was used to study the depth profile of RbF in the structure of the ETL/perovskite. For the SnO2/RbF/perovskite film, Figure 3e shows that the curve of Rb+ shows an almost constant height in the perovskite region, demonstrating a homogeneous distribution of the Rb in the perovskite layer. The low adsorption energy of Rb on the SnO2 surface observed in DFT could lead the Rb ions to easily escape into the perovskite. The infiltrated Rb ions are likely to partially occupy the interstitial sites of the perovskite, which will further inhibit ion migration and thereby suppress the mutual reaction of halides. As shown in Figure S11, Supporting Information, the XPS spectra of Rb 3d for the perovskite films based on SnO2/RbF display no obvious peak, which signifies that only a very small amount of Rb+ cations have penetrated into the perovskite. However, it's interesting that the curve of F- decreases severely from the SnO2 layer to the perovskite layer for the SnO2/RbF sample, which signifies that the F ions still stay at the SnO2/perovskite interface and do not enter the perovskite layer. Why do the F ions have a stronger favoritism for staying at the surface instead of infiltrating into the perovskite lattice? On the one hand, the huge size difference between I and F ions would induce a severe lattice strain once F ions were incorporated into the perovskite lattice. On the other hand, F ions locating at the FAI-terminated surfaces would make the local structure more stable via increasing the bonding with Pb and hydrogen bonds with FA ions. Figure 3f shows the depth profile of RbF in the SnO2. - RbF/perovskite model. Unlike the distribution of Rb+ in the SnO2/RbF perovskite film, here we can see that the Rb+ curve gradually rises in the perovskite region, which demonstrates that the Rb ions gradient penetrate into the perovskite layer and mainly distribute at the bottom of the perovskite films. In addition, the F ions still stay at the SnO2, /perovskite interface as discussed earlier.)\n##\n(SnO2<|>PEROVSKITE<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>SnO2 is used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in the synthesis of perovskite films.

The corresponding dark I-V curves are displayed in Figure 4a, which are divided into three parts including the ohmic region at low bias voltage, trap-filling limited region with current increasing greatly, and then the trap-free child's region. The trap density (Nt) is determined by the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) as follows: Nt = (2VTFLεrε0)/(qL^2) where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap filled limit region, and q is the electron charge.

Both theoretical studies and experimental  evidences have suggested that interstitial halogen   $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{I}_{i}$   and   $\\mathrm{Br}_{i,}$  )  defects and vacancies of lead   $(V_{\\mathrm{Pb}})$   and halides (  $V_{\\mathrm{I}}$   or   $V_{\\mathrm{Br}})$   act as  the main portions of traps in mixed halide perovskite.  The  medium ion radius of   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   make it possible to occupy interstitials or the A-site in the perovskite lattice. For example, recently  Nogueira and co-workers reported that   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   binds to interstitial  halogen   $\\mathrm{I}_{i}$   and Br i ) defects at the grain boundaries, resulting  in a reduced deep traps density by the formation of shallower  states.  In addition, theoretical research also demonstrated  that the deep traps can be reduced by alkali metals in contact  with interstitial halide defects.  For these reasons, we conclude that the decreased trap density should be attributed to the   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   cations, including those locating at the interface and in the  bulk perovskite.  \n\nTo investigate the charge carrier dynamics in the perovskite  films based on the various ETLs, photo luminescence (PL)  spectra were performed with the excitation wavelength of   $485\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . Figure   $^{4\\dag}$   shows that perovskite films based on RbFtreated   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   have a stronger steady-state PL intensity (the light  is incident from the perovskite side), which demonstrates that  the corresponding perovskite films are of high quality. In addition, PL peaks shift to a shorter wavelength after surface treatment, indicating that the perovskite films with RbF modification have fewer defects. Figure  $4c$   displays the time-resolved PL  (TRPL) spectra fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, and  the corresponding fitted data are listed in Table S5, Supporting  Information. As we all know, the fast decay   $(\\tau_{1})$   is ascribed to  the quenching of carriers at the ETL/perovskite interface, while  the slow decay   $(\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (RbF<|>PEROVSKITE<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>RbF is used in the synthesis of perovskite films, where it is found to penetrate into the perovskite layer. The Rb ions are likely to partially occupy the interstitial sites of the perovskite, which can inhibit ion migration and suppress the mutual reaction of halides. This suggests that RbF plays a role in modifying the perovskite structure and potentially improving its properties.<|>In order to explore whether RbF penetrates into the perovskite, time-of-flight secondary ions mass spectroscopy (ToFSIMS) was used to study the depth profile of RbF in the structure of the ETL/perovskite. For the SnO2/RbF/perovskite film, Figure 3e shows that the curve of Rb+ shows an almost constant height in the perovskite region, demonstrating a homogeneous distribution of the Rb in the perovskite layer. The low adsorption energy of Rb on the SnO2 surface observed in DFT could lead the Rb ions to easily escape into the perovskite. The infiltrated Rb ions are likely to partially occupy the interstitial sites of the perovskite, which will further inhibit ion migration and thereby suppress the mutual reaction of halides. As shown in Figure S11, Supporting Information, the XPS spectra of Rb 3d for the perovskite films based on SnO2/RbF display no obvious peak, which signifies that only a very small amount of Rb+ cations have penetrated into the perovskite. However, it's interesting that the curve of F- decreases severely from the SnO2 layer to the perovskite layer for the SnO2/RbF sample, which signifies that the F ions still stay at the SnO2/perovskite interface and do not enter the perovskite layer. Why do the F ions have a stronger favoritism for staying at the surface instead of infiltrating into the perovskite lattice? On the one hand, the huge size difference between I and F ions would induce a severe lattice strain once F ions were incorporated into the perovskite lattice. On the other hand, F ions locating at the FAI-terminated surfaces would make the local structure more stable via increasing the bonding with Pb and hydrogen bonds with FA ions. Figure 3f shows the depth profile of RbF in the SnO2. - RbF/perovskite model. Unlike the distribution of Rb+ in the SnO2/RbF perovskite film, here we can see that the Rb+ curve gradually rises in the perovskite region, which demonstrates that the Rb ions gradient penetrate into the perovskite layer and mainly distribute at the bottom of the perovskite films. In addition, the F ions still stay at the SnO2, /perovskite interface as discussed earlier.)\n##\n(SnO2<|>PEROVSKITE<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>SnO2 is used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in the synthesis of perovskite films.

The corresponding dark I-V curves are displayed in Figure 4a, which are divided into three parts including the ohmic region at low bias voltage, trap-filling limited region with current increasing greatly, and then the trap-free child's region. The trap density (Nt) is determined by the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) as follows: Nt = (2VTFLεrε0)/(qL^2) where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap filled limit region, and q is the electron charge.
