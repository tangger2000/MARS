The content focuses on the synthesis and characterization of CsPbX3 glass, discussing its optical properties and the effects of perovskite concentrations and heat-treatment conditions. There are no mentions of organizations, individuals, geographical locations, or events in the provided text.<|>The glass network structure, appropriate concentration of perovskite components and heat-treatment condition will play key roles in improving optical performance of CsPbX3 glass. We use a well-designed SiO2-B2O3-ZnO-CaF2 glass as the host to investigate the effect of perovskite concentrations (Cs2CO3-PbX2-NaX1, X=Br, I) and heat-treatments on optical properties of in situ grown CsPbX3 (Tables S3–S6, Supporting Information). The presence of these elements in the glass is confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray photo­ electron spectroscopy (XPS) data (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). As illustrated in Figure 1a, for the borosilicate glass, [BO4]- tetrahedra will partially replace [SiO4] ones in the silicate network, and charge imbalance is compensated by network modifying Zn2+ ions. High-content B2O3 will lead to increase of [BO3] triangular unit, which is conducive to the formation of a 2D glass network, and the introduced CaF2 can release F- ions, which can break inherent bridging oxygen bond (Si-O) and form lots of non-bridging oxygen. Consequently, the present glass network can provide sufficient passages and spaces for Cs+, Pb2+, and Br- diffusion and promote nucleation/growth of CsPbX3.<|>Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum proves the presence of vibrational structures of Si-O and B-O in the glass. As depicted in Figure 1b, a weaker band at 650-750 cm-1 is designated to binding vibration of B-O-B group in the borate segment. B-O stretching vibration in the [BO3] triangle is located at 1300-1550 cm-1, while the absorption band at 10000-1100 cm-1 belongs to bending vibration of Si-O-Si bond in the [SiO4] tetrahedral unit as well as stretching vibration of the [BO4] unit. As evidenced in Figure 1c,d, 11B magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum confirms the existence of [BO3] (-3±) and [BO4] (9 ppm) units, and 19F NMR spectrum supports the formation of Si-F bond (-142 pm) in the glass network. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns evidence the precipitation of CsPbX3 ( X3=Br3, Br1.5I1.5) inside glass. As shown in Figure 1e, the precursor glass (PG) shows a typical amorphous structure, and typical cubic CsPbX3 crystalline diffraction peaks are superimposed on the amorphous halo after heat treatment. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image (inset of Figure 1f) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrograph (Figure 1f) confirm homogenous distribution of CsPbX3 PeQDs with high crystal lin it y and sizes of 5-10 nm among glass matrix.<|>As shown in Figure 2a, CsPbBr3@ glass samples with various perovskite concentrations exhibit tunable cyan-green emissions (509–524 nm) under 450 nm blue light excitation. PL peak and absorption shoulder gradually red-shift (Figure 2a; Figure S3a, Supporting Information) and decay lifetime monotonously increases (Figure S3c–f, Supporting Information) with increase of perovskite concentration, indicating that the bandgap energy of the precipitated CsPbBr3 PeQDs can be finely modified by varying perovskite concentration. The fwhm values of CsPbBr3@ glass are in the range of 23.3-26.7 nm (Figure 2b), confirming the CsPbBr3@ glass exhibits a narrowband PL with high color purity. Meanwhile, PLQY of CsPbBr3@ glass shows a tendency of enhancement and then gradually decreases with increase of perovskite concentration. The best PLQY is ≈94% for the sample with perovskite concentration of 0.875 (Figure 2c), which is the highest value reported as far as we know (Table S1, Supporting Information). Increasing perovskite concentration in glass is beneficial for the diffusion of Cs+, Pb2+, and X- ions and the promotion of high-crystal lin it y CsPbX3 growth, leading to the uptrend in PLQY. The decrease in PLQY with further increase of perovskite concentration is probably due to excessive growth of CsPbBr3 PeQDs accompanied with an increase in the number of defects as non-radiative relaxation centers. Similarly, fwhm shows a rapid broadening when perovskite concentration is higher than 0.875, which is attributed to particle in homogeneity caused by overgrowth of CsPbBr3 PeQDs. Importantly, the same phenomenon is observed for the redemitting CsPbBr1.5I1.5@ glasses (Figure 2d–f). As the perovskite concentration increases, both the PL peak (625-637 nm) and the absorption shoulder red-shift (Figure 2d; Figure S3b, Supporting Information). The PLQY of CsPbBr1.5I1.5@ glass is also dependent on perovskite concentration (Figure 2f and Table S2, Supporting Information). When the perovskite concentration exceeds 1.05, the overgrowth of CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PeQDs results in a decrease in PLQY and a gradual broadening of fwhm (Figure 2e,f).<|>Additionally, crystallization condition also plays a crucial role for improving optical properties of CsPbX3 glass.

Similarly, fwhm shows a rapid broadening when perovskite  concentration is higher than 0.875, which is attributed to particle in homogeneity caused by overgrowth of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PeQDs.

The content focuses on the synthesis and characterization of CsPbX3 glass, discussing its optical properties and the effects of perovskite concentrations and heat-treatment conditions. There are no mentions of organizations, individuals, geographical locations, or events in the provided text.<|>The glass network structure, appropriate concentration of perovskite components and heat-treatment condition will play key roles in improving optical performance of CsPbX3 glass. We use a well-designed SiO2-B2O3-ZnO-CaF2 glass as the host to investigate the effect of perovskite concentrations (Cs2CO3-PbX2-NaX1, X=Br, I) and heat-treatments on optical properties of in situ grown CsPbX3 (Tables S3–S6, Supporting Information). The presence of these elements in the glass is confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray photo­ electron spectroscopy (XPS) data (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). As illustrated in Figure 1a, for the borosilicate glass, [BO4]- tetrahedra will partially replace [SiO4] ones in the silicate network, and charge imbalance is compensated by network modifying Zn2+ ions. High-content B2O3 will lead to increase of [BO3] triangular unit, which is conducive to the formation of a 2D glass network, and the introduced CaF2 can release F- ions, which can break inherent bridging oxygen bond (Si-O) and form lots of non-bridging oxygen. Consequently, the present glass network can provide sufficient passages and spaces for Cs+, Pb2+, and Br- diffusion and promote nucleation/growth of CsPbX3.<|>Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum proves the presence of vibrational structures of Si-O and B-O in the glass. As depicted in Figure 1b, a weaker band at 650-750 cm-1 is designated to binding vibration of B-O-B group in the borate segment. B-O stretching vibration in the [BO3] triangle is located at 1300-1550 cm-1, while the absorption band at 10000-1100 cm-1 belongs to bending vibration of Si-O-Si bond in the [SiO4] tetrahedral unit as well as stretching vibration of the [BO4] unit. As evidenced in Figure 1c,d, 11B magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum confirms the existence of [BO3] (-3±) and [BO4] (9 ppm) units, and 19F NMR spectrum supports the formation of Si-F bond (-142 pm) in the glass network. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns evidence the precipitation of CsPbX3 ( X3=Br3, Br1.5I1.5) inside glass.

High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image (inset of Figure 1f) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrograph (Figure 1f) confirm homogenous distribution of CsPbX3 PeQDs with high crystal lin it y and sizes of 5-10 nm among glass matrix.<|>As shown in Figure 2a, CsPbBr3@ glass samples with various perovskite concentrations exhibit tunable cyan-green emissions (509–524 nm) under 450 nm blue light excitation. PL peak and absorption shoulder gradually red-shift (Figure 2a; Figure S3a, Supporting Information) and decay lifetime monotonously increases (Figure S3c–f, Supporting Information) with increase of perovskite concentration, indicating that the bandgap energy of the precipitated CsPbBr3 PeQDs can be finely modified by varying perovskite concentration. The fwhm values of CsPbBr3@ glass are in the range of 23.3-26.7 nm (Figure 2b), confirming the CsPbBr3@ glass exhibits a narrowband PL with high color purity. Meanwhile, PLQY of CsPbBr3@ glass shows a tendency of enhancement and then gradually decreases with increase of perovskite concentration.
