In Figure 5b,c, both of those optimal devices exhibit  negligible hysteresis behavior similar to the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   devices  (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which further demonstrates excellent carrier transport at both anode and cathode  sides. All the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in  Table   1 . Furthermore, steady power output (SPO) tests were recorded  to further confirm negligible hysteresis of the corresponding  devices. Figure 5d showed the steady photo current profiles as  long as 300 s under a fixed bias at the maximum power point.  It is obvious that the photo current densities of both devices stay  almost constant with the time. The SPO efficiencies are 20.56  and   $19.32\\%$   for the optimal devices with doped and undoped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x},$  , respectively, which are comparable to the PCE obtained  from   $I{-}V$   curves.  \n\nFinally, external quantum efficiency (EQE) is employed to  explore the photon to current conversion efficiency. The EQE  spectra covered the entire visible range from 300 to   $800\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    with averaged EQE over   $85\\%$   for both doped and controlled  devices (Figure 5e). As expected, the device with doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$    showed higher EQE than control devices, especially at long  wavelength   $(700{-}800\\ \\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ), which is attributed to probably  the enhanced charge transfer and more balanced photocurrent collection efficiency in the molecule-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  -based  devices,  and also might be favored by the modulated  electronic structures at FTCNNQ and perovskite inter facial  layer.  $[39,40]J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   calculated from the integration of EQE spectra are  22.45 and   $21.99\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}}^{-2}$   for molecule-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   and control devices, respectively. Both values are within the reasonable error range and well matched with the values from   $I{-}V$  measurements.  The statistics of performances for total  32 devices were presented in Figure 5f and Figure S9 in the  Supporting Information and summarized in Table 1. As we can  see that the averaged PCE for control devices is   $18.70\\%$  , which  is   ${\\approx}7\\%$   less than that for devices with F6TCNNQ-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$     $(19.96\\%)$  ). From the statistics, the main improvement originated  from the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   from 1.06 to   $1.1\\mathrm{~V~}$   (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Moreover, the series resistance is decreased, while  \n\nTable 1.  $\\mathsf{N i O}_{x}$  HTLs. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/1d8338b577748f18b11583bf81c5fdbaba53f549f63d95003d1684907ab305a1-1727117643.jpg)  \n\nthe shunt resistance is increased after F6TCNNQ doping of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs (Table 1). The improvements of both   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and FF  mean the F6TCNNQ doping of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   decreases effectively the  recombination at the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x^{i}}$  –perovskite interface along with the  enhancement of carrier transport.  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a novel strategy to tailor  the op to electronic properties of inorganic hole transporting layer  in perovskite solar cells. Through a simple solution based on  one-step method,   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs can be strongly p-type doped with  F6TCNNQ molecules. Along with XPS, UPS was employed to  define the increase of work function and VBM of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs after  doping with F6TCNNQ. The energy level offset for charge transfer  between the VBMs of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   and perovskite is reduced from 0.18  to   $0.04~\\mathrm{eV}.$   Combining with first-principle calculations, EFM was  applied to directly verify electron transfer from F6TCNNQ to  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  confirming the above conclusion as well as the increase of holes  concentration and narrowing of VBM $\\cdot E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}.$   As a result of  this, the average PCE of CsFAMA mixed cation PSCs was boosted  by  ${\\approx}7\\%$   for F6TCNNQ-doped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   HTLs. The champion cells for  the CsFAMA mixed cation and   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   perovskite exhibited PCE  of   $20.86\\%$   and   $19.75\\%$  , respectively. Thus, our results offer an  extremely promising molecular doping method for inorganic carrier transport layers in PSCs, which can potentially be extended to  other combinations of inorganic semiconductors and functional  organic molecule dopants in the future. This methodology paves  a novel way to modulate the doping in hybrid electronics more  than perovskite and organic solar cells.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nW.C. and Y.C.Z. contributed equally to this work.
