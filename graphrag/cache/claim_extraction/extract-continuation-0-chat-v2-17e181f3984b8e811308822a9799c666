Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

However, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$   core/shell composite shows a  decreased intensity of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d peaks compared  to the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs (Figure 2d), suggesting that the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    NCs were encapsulated by   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  shell. In addition, it could be  observed that the XPS survey spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs also  contained Ti and O elements. The high-resolution XPS spectrum shows that two typical peaks of Ti 2p centered at 461.2  and   $466.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   correspond to the Ti   $2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$   and Ti   $\\mathrm{2\\mathfrak{p}_{1/2}}$   binding  energies of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs (Figure S8,  Supporting Information).

The peak area of hydroxyl groups decreases from  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$    composite (Figure 2e) to the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs (Figure 2f)  after calcination at   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , indicating a loss of hydroxyl groups  due to the dehydration process at high temperatures, which is  consistent with TGA and FTIR data as shown in Figure 2a,b,  respectively.  \n\nTo assess the environmental stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/ shell NCs, water tolerance tests were carried out by immersing  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$   composite, and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$    NCs in Millil-Q water under ambient conditions ( Figure   3 a).  The as-synthesized   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs (dispersed in toluene solution) are very sensitive to water and can lose their absorption  and PL features when in contact with Milli-Q water within a  few minutes (Figure 3b, Figure S9, Supporting Information).  Surprisingly, the dried   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NC powder, after being participated out from toluene solution, can be stable in water about   $1\\textup{d}$   and the PL of the powder was totally quenched after   ${\\approx}3\\ \\mathrm{d}$  .  The slightly enhanced stability of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NC powder  could be due to the protection from the condensed surface  ligand layer formed during drying process. The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  composite shows higher water stability than   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NC  powder and can be stable up to a week. However,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$    core/shell NCs are extremely stable in Milli-Q water and can  maintain the peak position and full width at half-maximum  (fwhm) of emission   $({\\approx}85\\%$   intensity) and absorption for at least  three months (Figure 3b,c, Figure S10, Supporting Information). This is in stark contrast to the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NC powder and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{x}$  composite that are fully quenched in a few days  with structure degradation (Figure S11, Supporting Information), which indicates that it is critical to form the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell by  high-temperature calcination to effectively protect the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    core, and rendering these   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs as the  most water-stable inorganic shell passivated perovskite NCs  reported, to the best of our knowledge. In addition, TEM analysis confirms that the size and morphology of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$    core/shell NCs remain unchanged following water immersing  for 12 weeks (Figure 3c inset and Figure S3c, Supporting Information). Furthermore, no phase change or chemical decomposition of crystal lites that can be observed from XRD after  12 weeks in water (Figure S11, Supporting Information).  \n\nThe photo stability of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs in toluene, dried   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NC powder, and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  core/shell NCs was  monitored by the PL intensity of the samples under UV light  irradiation. The as-synthesized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs in toluene solution are very sensitive to UV light and totally lose their PL intensity under UV light\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## None<|>None<|>None<|>None<|>None<|>None<|>None\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
