Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Recently, Park et al. reported the  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$    evolution using   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$   as a photo catalyst  in aqueous HI solution,  but the observed   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   evolution rate is far inferior to those  obtained with traditional semiconductor  photo catalytic materials.  So far, there has  been no report concerning composites of   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$   as a photo catalyst for   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   evolution in aqueous solution, although there  was a report on the photo catalytic   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$    reduction using a composite of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    perovskite quantum dots with graphene  oxide (GO) in ethyl acetate.  \n\nA facile and efficient photo reduction method is employed to synthesize  the composite of methyl ammonium lead iodide perovskite   $(\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3})$   with  reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This  ${\\mathsf{M A P b l}}_{3}/{\\mathsf{r G O}}$   composite is shown to  be an outstanding visible-light photo catalyst for  $\\mathsf{H}_{2}$   evolution in aqueous HI  solution saturated with  $\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}}\\end{array}$  .

The electro chemiluminescence performance of   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   is investigated to explore the charge transfer process, to find that the photo­ generated  electrons in  $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   are transferred to the rGO sites, where protons are  reduced to  $\\mathsf{H}_{2}$  .  \n\nBeing decorated with oxygen-containing  functional groups such as hydroxy, carbonyl, carboxy groups in the basal planes  and edges, GO is soluble in numerous sol  \n\nHybrid organic–inorganic per ovsk ites are promising materials  for high-performance photovoltaic devices because of their outstanding photovoltaic properties.  Methyl ammonium (MA)  lead iodide perovskite   $\\left(\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{I}_{3}\\right)$  ) solar cells have shown a rapid  improvement in the power conversion efficiency from   $3.8\\%$   in  2009 to over  $20\\%$   recently.    $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   has also been investigated  for photo electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution  as well as  \n\nvents to form GO-based hybrid composites.  The composites  of photo catalysts with graphene (or rGO) have been extensively  investigated.  For example, nanoparticles and ch romo ph ore  molecules grafted with rGO in multi component assemblies  are used to create electron transfer cascades in photocatalysts.    $\\mathrm{r}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{O}$   is an electron acceptor and transporter that can  enhance the performance of a semiconductor photo catalyst by  facilitating the transfer of photo generated electrons from the  semiconductor and by acting as a scaffold that increases the  surface area.  These observations prompt us to test the possibility that grafting rGO onto   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   particles might enhance  their   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   evolution properties. Here, we report a facile and efficient way of preparing the   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   composite, show that  powder samples of this composite are highly efficient for the   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   evolution, and are very stable in aqueous HI solution saturated with   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  , and explore the role of the rGO units play  in enhancing the photo catalytic activity of   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$  .  \n\nY.
