Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Although the Ag and Cl  vacancies show much lower energy cost than In and Cs vacancies, the formation of defect still shows over   $1\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   energy barrier  height, supporting the defect pass iv ation, which is consistent  with the experimental results of defect formation (Figure  4i).  In addition, we also conduct the numerical simulation of the  dynamic PL spectra of RE-1, RE-2, and RE-3 for comparison, in  which the stronger Jahn–Teller effect induces the stronger UC PL  and longer decay time (Figure S21–S22, Supporting Information).  \n\nIn summary, the   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}/E r^{3+}/B i^{3+}}$  tri-doping double perovskite  has been synthesized successfully with the multimodal luminescent performance. The incorporation of rare-earth ions and   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   ions successfully activated the concurrent excellent UC  PL, DS PL, and XEL performance for the first time. Moreover,  the superior stability against the harsh environment has also  been achieved including the thermal stability up to   $400~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , the  humidity, and high-dosage radiation resistance. Featuring such  capabilities, the material shows high X-ray sensitivity with a low  LOD of  $8.2\\;\\mathrm{nGy}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , endowing them the potential for practical and  robust anti-counterfeiting printing. Moreover, DFT calculations  also confirm that the introduction of dopants not only passivate  the defects but also significantly improve the luminescence performance due to the medium range order and Jahn–Teller effect.  Therefore, this toxic-element-free material has paved a new  direction for designing and fabricating environment-friendly  multimodal luminescence materials for realizing high-level anticounterfeiting techniques, which is also beneficial for the developments of multi functional luminescent materials in the future.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the China National  Funds for Excellent Young Scientists (Grant No.: 21522106) and National  Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.:21971117; 21771156), 111  Project (B18030) from China, and the Open Funds (RER U 2019001) of the  State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resource Utilization, the Functional  Research Funds for the Central Universities, Nankai University  (ZB19500202), the Shenzhen Fundamental Research Project (Grant No.:  JC YJ 20170818100717134), and the Early Career Scheme (ECS) fund (Grant  No.: PolyU 253026/16P) from the Research Grant Council (RGC) in  Hong Kong.
