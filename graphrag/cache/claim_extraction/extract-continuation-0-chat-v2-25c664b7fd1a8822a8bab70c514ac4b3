Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In the C1s  XPS spectrum of the pristine 2D perovskite films, the emerged  peak at a binding energy of   ${\\approx}292.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   can be ascribed to the   $\\pi{-}\\pi$  bonding from the phenyl functional group in the   $\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}$  cation (Figure 2c). Only one peak for   $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{C=N}$     $(402.0\\ \\mathrm{eV})$  ) can be  found in the N1s spectrum of the 2D perovskite films, which  \n\n+ is consistent with the functional group in the PEA  cations  (Figure 2d). In the C1s and N1s XPS spectra of the 2D-3D  perovskite films, the typical peaks for both 3D perovskite and  2D perovskite films can be observed, verifying the formation of  2D-3D hybrid perovskite films (Figure 2e,f). It is worth noting  that the   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$   bond shown in pristine 3D perovskite associated  with oxygen/moisture-induced degradation is absent in the C1s  XPS spectrum of the 2D-3D perovskite films, revealing the synergistic effect of steric hindrance from the in situ grown thin  2D perovskite layers and the partially passivated ionic vacancies  in the 3D perovskite films.  \n\nTo evaluate the effect of 2D perovskite layers in photovoltaic performance, we fabricated solar cells based on 3D perov­ skite films with and without PEAI treatment. The current  density–voltage   $(J-V)$   curves of the fabricated 3D and 2D-3D  PSCs are shown in  Figure   3 a. The best cell employing typical  3D perovskite material exhibits a short-circuit current density \n\n  $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\right)$   of   $22.83\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.05\\mathrm{~V},$   and a fill factor (FF) of \n\n 0.71, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of   $17.02\\%$  .  After a post-treatment step using PEAI solution with a concentration of   $1~\\mathrm{mg~mL^{-1}}$  , the champion device employing 2D-3D  perovskite films shows a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.11~\\mathrm{V},$   a FF of 0.73, and a  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$    of   $22.89\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , leading to an improved PCE of   $18.51\\%$  . Further increasing the concentration of PEAI solution to 4 and   $8\\,\\mathrm{\\meg~{\\mL}^{-1}}$   results in thicker 2D perovskite capping layers,  which leads to reduced   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF (Figure S6a, Supporting  Information). The deteriorated performance can be explained  by the poor charge transport property in thicker 2D perovskite  films originated from the severe quantum confinement effect,  while the preserved high   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   is due to the low non radiative  losses. Only when the thickness of 2D perovskite capping layers  is controlled within their effective charge-carrier diffusion  length, a decent charge-carrier mobility can be attained in the  2D-3D perovskite stacking layer.  All the photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated PSCs using different concentrations of  PEAI solutions are summarized in  Table   1 . The PCE achieved  in the 2D-3D PSCs with the optimized capping layer thickness  is among the best in the reported PSCs incorporating 2D perov­ skite materials (Table S1, Supporting Information). As shown  in Figure S4a (Supporting Information), the 3D PSCs displayed  obvious photo current hysteresis with PCEs of 17.02 and  $13.08\\%$    under a reverse and forward scan, respectively. To quantify the  hysteresis effect of PSCs, a hysteresis factor is calculated based  on the following equation  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{ergis\\;\\;factor}\\,{=}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{PCE}_{\\mathrm{reverse}}\\,{-}\\,\\mathrm{PCE}_{\\mathrm{forward}}}{\\mathrm{PCE}_{\\mathrm{reverse}}}\n$$  \n\nTable 1.   Summary of the best photovoltaic performance of the fabricated 2D-3D PSCs post-treated by different concentrations of PEAI  solutions. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/915ce827d598180ed959898a77d609bc71aab5ddd934821abaf3ae8faa7ef050-1723827027.jpg)  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/3d370d9654094f7e9d2f816baef909f7bea2281cce61c1438eda597efcd3604a-1723827024.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   XPS spectra of a,b) C1s and N1s of the 3D perovskite film, c,d) C1s and N1s of 2D perovskite film, and e,f) C1s and N1s of the 2D-3D  perovskite film   $(8\\mathsf{\\ m g\\ m L^{\\mathrm{-1}}\\ P E A I})$  ).  \n\nCompared to a high hysteresis factor   $(23.1\\%)$   of 3D PSCs, the  2D-3D PSCs showed suppressed photo current hysteresis with a  lower hysteresis factor of   $6.6\\%$   (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). Previous studies have demonstrated that the photocurrent hysteresis was originated from the ion migration and the  subsequent ion accumulation at the interfaces between perovskite and charge transport layers.  Therefore, the significantly reduced photo current hysteresis in the 2D-3D PSCs can  be ascribed to the 2D perovskite capping layer which effectively  blocks the ion diffusion pathway from the 3D perovskite layer  to the hole transport layer.  The steady-state photo current  efficiency of the 2D-3D PSCs exhibits a stabilized PCE of   $17.9\\%$  at the maximum power point of   $0.85\\,\\mathrm{~V},$  , which is comparable  to the device performance parameters extracted from the   $J{-}V$  curve (Figure 3b). To verify the reproducibility of high performance in the fabricated PSCs, the statistics of the PCE distribution for the fabricated 3D PSCs (21 devices) and 2D-3D PSCs  (21 devices) are presented in Figure 3c. The calculated average  PCE in the 2D-3D PSCs is   ${\\approx}17.5\\%$  , which is higher than  that   $(\\approx\\!16.4\\%)$   of 3D PSCs. The reliability of the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement achieved in the 2D-3D PSCs was also demonstrated by  the statistic of the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   distribution (Figure S5b, Supporting  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/41fd33305c609575725bf39d6819b362f7081f3d2a4f9dc2484738f04238beea-1723827028.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $J^{-V}$  power point (0.85 V) of 2D-3D PSCs, c) statistics of the PCE distribution of the fabricated 3D PSCs (21 devices) and 2D-3D PSCs (21 devices) under  reverse scans, and d) IPCE measurement and the integrated  $J\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Output\n\nNone of the entities specified in the entity specification ('organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event') were found in the provided text.
