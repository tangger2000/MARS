Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Previous studies have demonstrated the unsaturated metal ion dangling bonds are susceptible to the adsorption of oxygen molecules that readily forms a dative bond with  the perovskite surface.  We would thus regard this process  as the main source of surface oxidation and construct a model  with unsaturated   $\\mathrm{Sn}$   dangling bonds on the perovskite surface.  For the pristine   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$  , oxygen molecules would be bound to  two under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   ions, and capture electrons and  cause the oxidation of   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   ions. With the TSC addition, the  Lewis acid-base interaction between the   $\\scriptstyle S=C-\\mathrm{N}$   functional  group and   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   ion significantly reduces the charge transfer  from 0.31 to   $0.02\\textrm{e}$  . Moreover, it is difficult for the formation  of a superoxide species since the formation energy alters from   $-2.55$   to   $-0.86\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   with TSC pass iv ation. The suppressed surface electron transfer and superoxide species formation could  result in reduced deep level trap-state densities induced by surface oxidation.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the high-quality   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$    perovskite with reduced the defect state density at surfaces and  grain boundaries through the PASVD strategy. It is revealed  that the surface treatment using TSC passivator with   $\\scriptstyle S=C-\\mathrm{N}$    functional group could have a strong electrostatic attraction  and coordination interaction with charge defects, leading to an  enhanced electron cloud density around defects and increased  vacancy formation energies. Importantly, the surface passivation could reduce the deep level trap state density originating  from under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   ion and   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$  oxidation, significantly restraining the non radiative recombination and elongating carrier lifetime of the TSC treated   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   perovskite.  The surface passivated all-inorganic   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   PSCs with an  inverted configuration delivers a champion PCE of   $8.20\\%$  ,  together with a prolonged lifetime over   $90\\%$   of the initial PCE  after   $500\\textrm{h}$   of continuous illumination.
