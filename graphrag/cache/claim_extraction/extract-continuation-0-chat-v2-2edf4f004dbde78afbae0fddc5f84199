Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The formation of   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathsf{S}$   bond   $(468\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ) was also found (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). Taken together, the XPS and FT-IR results together indicate that both  $\\mathrm{-C=O}$   and  $-S\\mathrm{H}$   in DLCH have the ability to chemically interact with under coordinated  $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$    ions in perovskite. As a hydrogen bond donor,   $\\cdot\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$   may form a hydrogen bond with the iodide ions in the perovskite and/or compensate cation vacancy defects by an ionic bond with   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}{}^{4-}$  octahedron.  $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$   NMR and    $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$   NMR spectra were acquired to provide additional insights into the interactions between functional groups within DLCH molecules and per ovsk ites.  $^1\\mathrm{H}$   NMR spectra in Figure    $2\\mathrm{k}$   show that the chemical shifts of the functional groups  $-S\\mathrm{H}$   (1.22) and   $\\cdot\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   (8.57) in the DLCH molecule moved to 1.23 and 8.38, respectively, after mixing with  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . It was speculated that the thiol group can interact with the under coordinated  $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$    in the perovskite to form a Pb ─ S bond. The amino group can form hydrogen bonds with halide ions in the perovskite ﬁlm. The  $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$   NMR spectra in Figure  2l  revealed that the chemical shift of the carbonyl groups in the DLCH molecule moved from 169.34 to 169.05 after mixing with  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . This again conﬁrmed the strong coordination between  $\\mathrm{-C=O}$   and  $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  , which is beneﬁcial for the pass iv ation of under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   defects. It was conjectured that the  $-S\\mathrm{H}$  ,  ─ COOH,  $-\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$  , and Cl- groups in DLCH can synergistic ally passivate various charged defects, such as under coordinated  $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  , cation vacancies, halide ion vacancies, and  $\\mathrm{{PbI}_{3}}^{-}$  inversion defects.  \n\nBased on the above experimental results, the bottom-up cross-layer modi cation mechanisms with DLCH were proposed ( Figure  3 ). In the  $\\mathrm{{Sno}_{2}}$   layer,    $-S\\mathrm{H}$   and    $\\mathrm{-C=O}$   interact with uncoordinated   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  , thereby inhibiting the formation of   $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}}$  . At the buried interface, the  $-S\\mathrm{H}$  ,  $-\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$  , COOH, and  $C\\mathrm{l^{-}}$  can passivate the various charged defects from the bottom surface of perovskite ﬁlms, which reduces inter facial non radiative recombination. It needs to be noted that DLCH modi cation can release inter facial residual stress and regulate perovskite crystallization.  \n\nFigure  4 a  is a schematic diagram showing the enhanced dispersion of the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   colloidal solution after the addition of DLCH. After the enhanced dispersion, the roughness of the prepared   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ﬁlm is reduced. The phenomenon of spontaneous nano particle agglomeration frequently occurs in colloidal solutions. 13 ]   We utilized dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine particle sizes in both freshly prepared and 7 day-aged  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   solutions, both with and without modiﬁers, as illustrated in Figure    $^{4\\mathrm{b},\\mathrm{c}}$  . In the case of the pristine   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   dispersion, the particle size was sign i cant ly enlarged from 42.44 to   $88.16~\\mathrm{nm}$  following aging, whereas the particle sizes of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -DLCH colloidal solutions were slightly increased from 34.58 to   $49.70\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  . This shows that the modiﬁer can inhibit the agglomeration of nanoparticles. The inhibitory agglomeration is associated with the strong coordination of the  $\\mathrm{-C=O}$   and  $-S\\mathrm{H}$   functional groups to the uncoordinated   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  . High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further conﬁrmed that a dense thin layer was formed on the surface of DLCH. We speculate that DLCH coordinates with   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   through its active functional groups, thereby forming a nanolayer on the  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   nanoparticles (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information).
