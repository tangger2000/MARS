When acidic poly \n\n (3,4-ethylene di oxy thi oph ene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)  is used as the hole-injection layer for PeLEDs, the PEDOT:PSS  can etch the underlying ITO electrodes and thereby cause  release of In and Sn atoms.  The released In and Sn atoms  can diffuse into the PEDOT:PSS and MHP layers and accelerate the degradation of the PeLEDs (Figure 5B) because the  metallic species can be luminescence-quenching centers.   In  PeLEDs in which the electron–hole diffusion lengths are  very long   $(>1\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{m})$  ,  luminescence quenching by impurity  and migrated metal species can be more critical compared with  OLEDs in which the exciton diffusion lengths are short   $\\mathrm{{(5-10\\nm)}}$  .  Therefore, prevention of diffusion of metallic  species toward emission layers will be a very important task to  improve the device efficiency and lifetime.  \n\n# 2.2.4. Color Instability  \n\nOne of the important challenges to realize high-stability  PeLEDs is to stabilize the emission color. Because the color of  PeLEDs mainly depends on the halide anions, halide separation in mixed-halide MHP emission layers can cause a change  in emission color.  Halide separation is a result of the  phase instability of mixed-halide MHPs.  A DFT calculation on the phase diagram of   $\\mathrm{\\MAPb}(\\mathrm{I}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Br}_{x})_{3}$   solid solutions  revealed that they have a misc i bil it y gap at room temperature,  binodal points at  $x=0.2$   and 0.7, and undergo spinodal decomposition at   $0.3\\,<\\,x\\,<\\,0.6$  .  The phase instability of mixedhalide MHP systems   $(\\mathrm{MAPb}(\\mathrm{I}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Br}_{x})_{3})$   was clearly visualized by  cath odo luminescence imaging, which showed the emergence  of I-rich clusters and the increase in the number of clusters  with increasing light-soaking time ( Figure   6 ).  The halide  separation in   $\\mathrm{\\MAPb}(\\mathrm{I}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Br}_{x})_{3}$   was also well explained by a  molecular dynamics simulation; the result suggested that localized lattice strain induced by coupling between photo generated  charges and phonon modes drives phase separation.  \n\nHalide separation was shown in the driving-voltage-dependent  EL spectrum of   $\\mathrm{\\MAPlbBr}_{3-x}\\mathrm{I}_{x}$  PeLECs.  As the voltage was  increased from 2.0 to   $7.0\\ \\mathrm{V},$   the EL spectrum gradually shifted  from 743 to   $710~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  , and a green EL peak at   $532~\\mathrm{nm}$   emerged  beginning at   $6.0\\ \\mathrm{V}.^{[139]}$   Because the green EL peak corresponds  to the emission of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  , the change in the EL spectrum was  explained by the migration of   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   anions.  Also, an electrical  field can drive halide separation in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1-x}\\mathrm{I}_{x}$   NP PeLEDs.   The PeLEDs that incorporated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1.88}\\mathrm{I}_{1.12}$   NPs that emitted  orange PL at   $558\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , instead emitted red EL at   $650\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  after  turn-on; the EL emission was split into a green emission at   $518\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   (i.e., the emission of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}^{\\prime}$  ) and a red emission at   $665\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   (i.e., the emission of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{0.5}\\mathrm{I}_{2.5});^{[144]}$   over time, the  intensity of the green emission increased, whereas the intensity of  the red emission decreased and eventually disappeared. This color  instability is a result of the production of pure  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   domains by  ion migration induced by an electrical field, without red-emitting  neighboring domains that could induce Förster resonance energy  transfer.  After the PeLEDs were turned off, orange and green  PL emissions were both observed; this result means that halide  separation is partially reversible and that in the absence of an  electric field, halide anions redistribute among NPs.  \n\n# 3. Strategies to Improve the Stability of MHP  Materials and PeLEDs  \n\nIn this section, we review recently reported strategies to overcome the instability of MHP materials and the limited operational stability of PeLEDs ( Figures   7  and  8 ).  Recently, the  operational stability of PeLEDs has been significantly  improved, but it is still much inferior to the stability  of  OLEDs   $(L_{50}\\,>\\,500\\,\\,\\,000\\,\\,\\,{\\mathrm{h}}$   at   $1000\\,\\textrm{c d}\\,\\textrm{m}^{-2})^{[148]}$  and QD LEDs   $(L_{50}\\approx300\\;000\\;\\mathrm{h}$   at   $100\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  ).  We have conducted an exhaustive survey on the reported operational lifetime of PeLEDs ( Table   1 ).  The operational lifetimes of PeLEDs can be characterized by the  time taken for the luminance to decay from the initial luminance   $L_{0}$   to  $50\\%$  ,  $70\\%$  , and  $80\\%$   (defined as  ${\\cal L}_{50},\\,{\\cal L}_{70},$   and   $L_{80}$  , respectively).  However, the summarized studies have different measurement  conditions for operational lifetime. To effectively compare the  operational lifetime among the reported devices, the measurement conditions should be standardized as in the field of OLEDs;  the initial luminance should be reported (commonly used initial  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/b47774627b6b7eafe5d72c9b427ac23afe7f2b44bbbc41e4e0f79a4d0df6f3b9-1723832768.jpg)  \nFigure 6.   A) PL spectra of a  $\\mathsf{M A P b}(\\mathsf{I}_{0.1}\\mathsf{B r}_{0.9})_{3}$   film after different light exposure times (0, 30, 60, 90 s).
