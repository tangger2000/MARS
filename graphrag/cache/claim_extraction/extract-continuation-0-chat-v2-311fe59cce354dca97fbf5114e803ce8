Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

Specifically,   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{B r}$   and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   powder were dissolved  in dimethyl form amide to prepare the   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{P b B r}_{3}$   solution. The \n\n  $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{P b B r}_{3}$   solution   $(28.5\\ \\mathsf{w t\\%})$   was then prepared by reacting \n\n  $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{B r}$   powder and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   in 1:1  mol ratio at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\mathsf{T}2\\textsf{h}$  .

High-resolution X-ray  diffraction measurement was taken using X’Pert MRD, with Cu K α 1  line operated at with   $V=40~\\mathrm{kV}$   and   $I=20$    mA. UV–vis absorbance  spectrum was measured at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer  Lambda 950 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer in the reflection mode  with an integrating sphere attachment operating in the   $300{-}700\\ \\mathsf{n m}$    region. A highly refined barium sulfate   $({\\mathsf{B a S O}}_{4})$   plate was used as  the reference (  $100\\%$   reflectance). The steady-state and time-resolved  photo luminescence measurements of   $\\mathsf{M A P b B r}_{3}$   single crystals were  performed using a PicoQuant FT-300. Photo luminescence mapping  measurement of   $\\mathsf{M A P b B r}_{3}$   single crystals was performed using a  PicoQuant FT-100. The dark   $I{-}V$  curve was recorded using Keithley  2400 and used to calculate the trap density by Equation (1). The  thickness of   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{P b B r}_{3}$   single crystals was measured by the  digital Vernier caliper. Contact angle measurements were contacted  on a DSA100 instrument. The photo response characteristics for  the devices were collected by using an optical chopper to generate  pulse light illumination, a Keithley 2400 source meter to record the  photo current response under various bias voltage and a series of  LED light illumination. The fast speed response characteristics of  the devices were measured by an optical chopper and a Tektronix  MDO 3104 Mixed Domain Oscilloscope. Besides, the irradiation  was achieved by using a   $532\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   semiconductor laser. The spectral  photo response measurements were performed with a 300 W Xe lamp  equipped with a manual monochromator. A set of optical power meter  (VEGA OPHIR PD300-UV) was used to measure the incident powers.  All measurements were taken at room temperature.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.C.L. and Y.X.Z. contributed equally to this work.
