Efficiency progress of tin-based perovskite solar cells including MASnI3, CsSnI3, and FASnI3 PSCs over recent years. The references of all points are shown in the Supporting Information. Figure 5. This great improvement demonstrates that the passivation of surface defects associated with surface Sn vacancy and uncoordinated Sn ions is essential to obtain high-performance Sn-based PSCs. Figure 4c presents the stable photo current and power output of the best performing device. The stable output efficiency of the best device is 8.02% with a stable current density of 17.0 mA cm-2 under a bias voltage of 0.47 V for 200 s, which is approximate to that of an acquired J-V curve. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement is performed on the pristine and TSC treated CsSnI3 solar cell. The EQE value (Figure 4d) of TSC treated CsSnI3 device shows significant enhancement compared to that of pristine device within the whole absorption range, resulting in the increase of integrated current density from 17.5 to 19.7 mA cm-2. It is worth noting that the EQE curve of the TSC treated CsSnI3 device exhibits an increased intensity especially at the long wavelength range, which might be originated from the suppression of non radiative recombination, enabling the excited charge carriers in a longer wavelength to be extracted by carrier extraction layers. Finally, long-term stability measurements are conducted on the CsSnI3 devices under an ambient condition with constant AM 1.5 G illumination. In Figure 4e, the PCE of encapsulated pristine CsSnI3 solar cell declines to 71% of its initial value after 500 h testing. The efficiency decay might be attributed to the increase of surface Sn-related defects induced by light or other variables. Encouragingly, the stability is improved dramatically for the TSC treated CsSnI3 solar cell, which maintains over 90% initial efficiency after aging for 500 h in the same condition. Figure S17, Supporting Information, compares the stability of the pristine and TSC treated CsSnI3 PSCs without encapsulation upon exposure to air under constant illumination. Due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+, the pristine device decays rapidly to only 50% initial PCE within 75 h. In contrast, the PCE of the TSC treated PSC can maintain at over 50% for more than 200 h, suggesting that the TSC passivator plays a restricting function on the oxidation of Sn2+. Subsequently, a simulation was performed to explore mechanistic insights regarding how TSC passivator reduces the surface trap-state of perovskite film. As discussed in Figure 1a, the Sn-induced surface defects mainly include Sn vacancies and under coordinated Sn ions, as well as the unsaturated Sn ion dangling bond induced oxidation. In Figure 6 a–d, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed to analyze the Sn vacancy formation energy and charge density distribution on the perovskite crystal surface. In the process of Sn vacancy formation, I- ions would transfer electrons to the neighboring Sn2+ ions, which forces the Sn2+ ions off their original sites (Figure 6a,b). Compared with the transferred charge of 8.18x10-2 e in pristine CsSnI3, more electrons (9.03x10-2 e) need to be supplied for the formation of Sn vacancy in the TSC passivated CsSnI3, suggesting a higher vacancy formation barrier with the passivation of TSC (Figure 6c,d). Similarly, the calculated vacancy formation energy of TSC treated perovskite is 1.74 eV, larger than that of pristine perovskite (1.61 eV). The increased charge-state density and vacancy formation energy both demonstrate that the TSC molecule can effectively passivate a surface under coordinated Sn ion and reduce the chance of a surface Sn vacancy. In addition, considering the inevitable oxygen molecules adsorption and the Sn2+ oxidation process on perovskite surface, we also performed the DFT calculation to estimate this influence in the presence and absence of TSC, as shown in Figure 6e–h. Previous studies have demonstrated the unsaturated metal ion dangling bonds are susceptible to the adsorption of oxygen molecules that readily forms a dative bond with the perovskite surface. We would thus regard this process as the main source of surface oxidation and construct a model with unsaturated Sn dangling bonds on the perovskite surface. For the pristine CsSnI3, oxygen molecules would be bound to two under coordinated Sn2+ ions, leading to the formation of a dative bond and subsequent oxidation of Sn2+ ions. In contrast, the presence of TSC passivator prevents the direct interaction between oxygen molecules and Sn2+ ions, effectively reducing the oxidation process on the perovskite surface. This is supported by the DFT calculation results, which show a significant reduction in the oxidation potential of Sn2+ ions in the presence of TSC. The TSC molecule acts as a protective layer, preventing the oxidation of Sn2+ ions and maintaining the stability of the perovskite film. Furthermore, the TSC passivator also improves the charge transport properties of the perovskite film. The presence of TSC reduces the recombination of charge carriers at the surface defects, leading to an increase in the carrier lifetime and overall device performance. This is evident from the improved external quantum efficiency (EQE) and fill factor of the TSC treated CsSnI3 solar cell compared to the pristine device. The TSC passivator enhances the charge extraction efficiency by reducing the non-radiative recombination losses, allowing more charge carriers to contribute to the photocurrent. Additionally, the TSC passivator also improves the stability of the perovskite film under ambient conditions. The presence of TSC reduces the degradation of the perovskite film caused by moisture, oxygen, and other environmental factors. This is evident from the long-term stability measurements, which show that the TSC treated CsSnI3 solar cell maintains over 90% initial efficiency after aging for 500 h, while the pristine device decays rapidly to only 50% initial PCE within 75 h. The TSC passivator acts as a protective layer, preventing the degradation of the perovskite film and maintaining its performance over time. In conclusion, the TSC passivator plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of Sn-based perovskite solar cells. It effectively passivates the surface defects, reduces the surface trap-state density, and improves the charge transport properties of the perovskite film. The TSC passivator also enhances the stability of the perovskite film under ambient conditions, making it a promising material for high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.", "input": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

We would thus regard this process as the main source of surface oxidation and construct a model with unsaturated Sn dangling bonds on the perovskite surface. For the pristine CsSnI3, oxygen molecules would be bound to two under coordinated Sn2+ ions, leading to the formation of a dative bond and subsequent oxidation of Sn2+ ions. In contrast, the presence of TSC passivator prevents the direct interaction between oxygen molecules and Sn2+ ions, effectively reducing the oxidation process on the perovskite surface. This is supported by the DFT calculation results, which show a significant reduction in the oxidation potential of Sn2+ ions in the presence of TSC. The TSC molecule acts as a protective layer, preventing the oxidation of Sn2+ ions and maintaining the stability of the perovskite film. Furthermore, the TSC passivator also improves the charge transport properties of the perovskite film. The presence of TSC reduces the recombination of charge carriers at the surface defects, leading to an increase in the carrier lifetime and overall device performance. This is evident from the improved external quantum efficiency (EQE) and fill factor of the TSC treated CsSnI3 solar cell compared to the pristine device. The TSC passivator enhances the charge extraction efficiency by reducing the non-radiative recombination losses, allowing more charge carriers to contribute to the photocurrent. Additionally, the TSC passivator also improves the stability of the perovskite film under ambient conditions. The presence of TSC reduces the degradation of the perovskite film caused by moisture, oxygen, and other environmental factors. This is evident from the long-term stability measurements, which show that the TSC treated CsSnI3 solar cell maintains over 90% initial efficiency after aging for 500 h, while the pristine device decays rapidly to only 50% initial PCE within 75 h. The TSC passivator acts as a protective layer, preventing the degradation of the perovskite film and maintaining its performance over time. In conclusion, the TSC passivator plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of Sn-based perovskite solar cells. It effectively passivates the surface defects, reduces the surface trap-state density, and improves the charge transport properties of the perovskite film. The TSC passivator also enhances the stability of the perovskite film under ambient conditions, making it a promising material for high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells."}]}
