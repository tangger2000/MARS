For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim.

Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.

As  shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, we achieve  relatively stable mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite component   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3})_{3}$   with PL peak at around   $700~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  We then add   $50\\%$   molar excess of   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{I}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   in the  film as this composition has higher PL quantum yield (PLQY)  and longer carrier lifetime than other   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{I}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   molar  ratios and the stoic hio metric   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3})_{3}$   film  (Figure S2, Supporting Information). We use the above composition as control film and add extra FPMATFA to examine the  dual pass iv ation effect. Energy-dispersive X-ray mapping shows  that FPMATFA is uniformly distributed in the perovskite film  (Figure S3, Supporting Information).  \n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were  performed to examine the coordination of FPMATFA with  lead and halide defects. We also tested   $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   additive which was shown to be an effective additive for PeLEDs.  The molar ratio of excess FPMATFA or   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   in the  films is set to   $40\\%$   as this ratio results in better device performance. As shown in Figure 1b, the shoulder peaks around  141 and   $137~\\mathrm{eV}$   corresponding to metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   states are very  obvious in the control film. The shoulder peaks weaken, but  still exist, after the addition of extra   $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$  . In contrast, they become negligible after the addition of FPMATFA.  We note that the binding energy of   $\\mathrm{~I~}3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   and   $\\mathrm{~I~}3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   become  smaller after incorporation of extra   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   (Figure 1c),  possibly resulting from strong positively charged   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$   end of  the FPMA cations. The   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$   end of FPMA cations can bind  with iodide through hydrogen bond, which weakens the interaction between   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   and I. Nevertheless, the binding energy of I  3d and Pb 4f becomes higher after incorporation of FPMATFA  due to strong binding between  $\\mathrm{Pb}$   of   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{6}$   octahedron and TFA  anions, leading to stronger   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{I}$   interactions. The same phenomenon can also be observed in   $\\mathrm{Br}\\,\\,3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   and Br   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   result  (Figure 1d). These results also suggest that the perovskite structure can be effectively stabilized by the introduction of functional groups which are strongly bonded to lead. The interaction between FPMATFA and perovskite is also demonstrated  by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FTIR  peaks located at 1688 and   $1211~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   are attributed to the   $\\mathrm{C=O}$  and   $\\mathrm{CF}_{3}$   bond stretching vibration of TFA, respectively. The   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   peak shifts to   $16\\bar{7}6~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   in the FPMATFA-passivated  film due to the interaction between the   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   ions.  The broadened profile of   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   stretching vibration peaks also  demonstrates the altered molecule state (FPMA) in perovskite  compared to that of FPMATFA powder (Figure S4, Supporting  Information).  \n\nWe calculate relative energy and density of states (DOS)  using DFT to directly examine the dual pass iv ation mechanism of FPMATFA. We carry out calculation on a   $(\\mathrm{FA}_{0.4}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.6})$  I-terminated surface. As shown in Figure  1e, the formation  energy of both halide dangling bonds and under coordinated  lead increases after incorporation of FPMATFA, suggesting that  FPMA cations and TFA anions preferentially bound to perovskite surface and stabilize the perovskite surface structure.  We then calculate DOS of two typical surface defects which  have lower formation energy, negatively charged   $\\mathrm{I_{i}},$   and positively charged   $\\mathrm{{Pb}_{\\mathrm{{i}}}}$  . The   $\\mathrm{I_{i}}$   introduces a deep defect level (  $(0.4~\\mathrm{eV}$  above the valence band maximum) in the bandgap and serves  as a hole trap. After introducing FPMA cations, the trap states  are passivated (Figure 1f). The   $\\mathrm{{Pb}_{\\mathrm{{i}}}}$   introduces a deep trap state  below the conduction band minimum and serves as an electron trap. The TFA anions can obviously passivate the electron  trap states (Figure 1g). We also calculate DOS of   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{I}$   antisite  defects   $\\mathrm{{(Pb}_{I}}$   and  $\\mathrm{{I_{Pb}})}$   on a   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  -terminated surface, which shows  higher formation energy and provides deeper transition energy  level.  After introducing FPMA cations or TFA anions,  the trap states can also be passivated (Figure S5, Supporting  Information).  \n\nPLQY and time-resolved PL (TRPL) were conducted to  examine the pass iv ation effect of FPMATFA compared to   $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   and   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$  . The steady-state absorption  and PL spectra of perovskite films with different molar ratios  of   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$  , and FPMATFA are shown  in  Figure   $_{2\\mathrm{a-c}}$  . As shown in Figure 2d–f, both   $\\mathrm{FPMAI_{0.7}B r_{0.3}};$   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$   and FPMATFA have pass iv ation effect and  result in higher PLQY than the control film (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Notably, the perovskite film shows a  relatively high PLQY of   $15\\%$   with   $40\\%$   molar extra FPMATFA  even at a low excitation intensity of   $0.008\\mathrm{~mW~}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . Bi-exponential decays were used to fit the TRPL curves. The slow decay  component could be attributed to radiative recombination,  while the fast decay component could be ascribed to\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (organization<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The organization is involved in the research and development of mixed-cation mixed-halide MHPs to tune their photo luminescence (PL) emission to the red range.<|>We use mixed FA/Cs-based mixed-halide MHPs in this work to tune its photo luminescence (PL) emission to red range.)\n##\n(person<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The person is involved in the research and development of mixed-cation mixed-halide MHPs to tune their photo luminescence (PL) emission to the red range.<|>We use mixed FA/Cs-based mixed-halide MHPs in this work to tune its photo luminescence (PL) emission to red range.)\n##\n(geo<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The geo is involved in the research and development of mixed-cation mixed-halide MHPs to tune their photo luminescence (PL) emission to the red range.<|>We use mixed FA/Cs-based mixed-halide MHPs in this work to tune its photo luminescence (PL) emission to red range.)\n##\n(event<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The event is involved in the research and development of mixed-cation mixed-halide MHPs to tune their photo luminescence (PL) emission to the red range.<|>We use mixed FA/Cs-based mixed-halide MHPs in this work to tune its photo luminescence (PL) emission to red range.)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
