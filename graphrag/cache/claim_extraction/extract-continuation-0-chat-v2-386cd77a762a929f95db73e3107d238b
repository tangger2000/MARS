Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

What's  more interesting is that the hysteresis was further suppressed  when the RbF was spin-coated on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   surface. The hysteresis is normally attributed to the charge accumulation at the  interface, which mainly originates from ion migration, interfacial defects, and unbalanced charge transport between the ETL  side and HTL side within the PSCs.  The   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   incorporation  into the perovskite films can effectively inhibit the ions migration by occupying the interstitial sites in the bulk perovskite  and decrease the interstitial halide defects at the ETL/perovskite interface, which may be the most significant factors for  reduced hysteresis.  In addition, the improved charge transport process at the interface between   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and perovskite also  contributes to the inhibition of hysteresis. As for the hysteresis of the   $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2}/$  RbF-based device, it is less than that of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RbF-based device, which could be ascribed to the more  Rb cations escaped into the perovskite films for   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$  .  The steady-state output at the maximum power point (MPP)  was performed to explore the operation status of PSCs. As  shown in FigureÂ 5d, only   $90\\%$   of its maximum PCE remained  for the control device after measurement for   $300\\ \\mathrm{s}$  , while the  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/af3ef712151a162890a923af54ad1231b7e56d40bce6b41ccba423796ad28e42-1727102034.jpg)  \nFigure   6.â  $J\\cdot$  â V  curves of 2Dâ3D champion PSCs based on  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/$  RbF. The inserted structure is the double-passivated perovskite model.  \n\n$\\mathrm{{subseteq}O_{2}/}$  /RbF-based and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF-based devices almost maintain   $97\\%$   and   $96\\%$   of their maximum PCE under the same test conditions, respectively. We prepared 37 individual devices based  on different ETLs to explore their   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},J_{\\mathrm{sc}},$   FF, and PCE distributions. As shown in Figures S19âS22, Supporting Information,  the change trends of device parameters are basically the same  as FigureÂ 5b, and the average PCE value was indeed augmented  after the RbF treatment.  \n\nFormation of a 2D pervoskite layer on the 3D perovskite  film surface is a useful strategy to passivate the perovskite  film. In our previous work, it was demonstrated that phenethylammonium iodide with electron-donating groups presents  favorable pass iv ation effects. The pass iv ation is attributed to  the electrostatic interaction between the benzene ring and  the under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   ions.  Based on this, 4-methoxyph en ethyl ammonium iodide (  $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{O}$  -PEAI) was spin-coated  on the annealed perovskite film surface to further enhance  the PCE of the solar cells, and double-sided modified 2Dâ3D  PSCs were prepared. Beyond expectation,  Figure   6  shows  an amazing PCE of   $23.38\\%$   for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   based   $2\\mathrm{D}â3\\mathrm{D}$  PSCs, along with the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.213~\\mathrm{V},J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $24.32\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , and  FF of  $79.29\\%$  . The integrated current of the double-sided passivated perovskite solar cell is   $23.34~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (FigureÂ  S23,  Supporting Information), approaching the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   from the   $J{-}V$  curve in spite of the small mismatch. The extremely small   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   deficit of   $0.347~\\mathrm{V}$   is attributed to the significantly reduced  traps/defects density at the ETL/per ovsk ites and HTL/perovskite interface.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we find that different modifications of RbF to   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   have completely different effects on the performance of  PSCs. When we introduce RbF into bulk   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}O_{2}.}$  , the electron  mobility of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and charge transport at the ETL/perovskite  interface are both improved due to the strong interaction  between F and Sn. The PSC based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RbF produces  an excellent PCE of   $21.27\\%$  , along with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.140Â V,  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $24.38\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  , and FF of   $76.53\\%$  . In contrast, the active   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$    cations escape into bulk perovskite while modifying RbF onto  the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   surface, resulting in a suppressed ion migration  in the per ovsk ites as well as a reduced carriers' recombination at the   $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2}/$  perovskite interface, therefore increasing the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   from 1.131 to   $1.165\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   for PSCs with negligible hysteresis.  However, no matter how RbF modifies   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$  stays in place  and do not enter the perovskite. Double-sided passivated PSCs  with RbF and  $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{O}$  -PEAI on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and perovskite surface,  respectively, produce an outstanding PCE of   $23.38\\%$   with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$    of   $1.213\\mathrm{~V},$  ,   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $24.32\\mathrm{\\mA\\^{-2}}$  , and FF of   $79.29\\%$  . This work  demonstrates the great importance of the treatment methods  on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , and provides one kind of cheap and effective modification material RbF for planar n-i-p PSCs.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis research is supported by National Key Research Program of China  (2016 Y FA 0200104) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the  Chinese Academy of Sciences (X DB 12030200).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Data Availability Statement  \n\nResearch data are not shared.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ndoping, perovskite solar cells, rubidium fluoride,   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  , surface  modification  \n\nReceived: December 2, 2020 Revised: January 28, 2021 Published online: February 17, 2021  \n\n[1]\t A.Â  Kojima, K.Â  Teshima, Y.Â  Shirai, T.Â  Miyasaka,  J.
