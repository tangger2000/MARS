Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Striking anisotropy proves that   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$   is along the   $b$  -axis, corresponding to the result of structural analysis. To further investigate ferro electricity of 1, we performed the measurements  of   $P{-}E$   (polarizationâelectric field) hysteresis loops along the   $b$  -axis at  $50~\\mathrm{Hz}$   at various temperatures by classical SawyerâTower  circuit. As shown in FigureÂ 2c, the   $P{-}E$   hysteresis loops display  well-defined rectangle in the temperature range from 393 to   $413\\mathrm{~K~}$  , which clearly confirms that the ferro electricity is existing  in LTP. When temperature rises to   $428\\,\\mathrm{~K~}$   (above   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$  ), the   $P{-}E$  loop become rounded, rather than the expected straight line  due to the current leakage, which indicates that 1 lose ferroelectricity. At 393Â K,   $E_{\\mathrm{c}}$   (coercive field)  $=9.6\\ensuremath{~\\mathrm{kV}~}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}$  ,   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   (remanent polarization)  $=9.1\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and   $P_{\\mathrm{s}}=10.5\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . Based  on the point charge model, the calculation   $P_{\\mathrm{s}}=8.7\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   is  close to the experimental value (The detailed process is shown  in the Supporting Information). The determined   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$   is much  larger than those 2D per ovsk ites ferroelectric s, such as [2-fluoro benz yl ammonium  $]_{2}\\mathrm{PbCl}_{4}$     $(5.35\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ,    $\\mathrm{(MA)}_{2}\\mathrm{(MA)}_{2}\\mathrm{Pb}_{3}\\mathrm{Br}_{10}$   \n\n  $(5\\mathrm{~\\,~}\\upmu C\\mathrm{~\\,~}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$     $\\mathrm{(C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3})_{2}C s P b_{2}B r_{7}}$  (4.2Â   $\\mu{\\cal C}\\mathrm{\\boldmath~\\Gamma~}\\mathrm{\\boldmath~\\cm^{-2})}$  ,  \n\n  $\\mathrm{(C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3})_{2}(N H_{2}C H N H_{2})P b_{2}B r_{7}}$    (3.8Â   $\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{~\\ensuremath~{~\\mu~}~}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ),   and \n\n  $\\mathrm{\\small{[CH_{3}(C H_{2})_{3}N H_{3}]_{2}(C H_{3}N H_{3})P b_{2}B r_{7}}}$   $(3.6~\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\ \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  .  Pyro- electricity reflects the temperature dependence of   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$   of polar  solids. The pyroelectric current was recorded in a heating run  along the   $b$  -axis of 1 (FigureÂ 2d). Only weak pyroelectric current  is detected in the temperature range from 300 to   $410\\ K$  , and a  sharp pyroelectric current response is generated in the vicinity  of   $T_{\\mathsf{c}},$   indicating a para electricâferroelectric phase transition.  The determined   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$   at room temperature is   $9.9~\\upmu\\mathrm{C~cm}^{-2}$  , consistent with that from the   $P{-}E$   loops.  \n\nPiezo response force microscopy (PFM) has become an  extremely useful method for characterizing ferroelectric materials, which can achieve non-destructive observation and manipulation of ferroelectric domains at the nanoscale. The as-grown  crystal of 1 is plate-like and its polarization direction is parallel to  the largest surface, so we performed the measurement of lateral  PFM. The initial state is the monodomain. After heating to   $430~\\mathrm{K}$  and then cooling to room temperature, the multi domain crystal  is obtained. Phase image provides knowledge of the direction  of polarization of a domain. As shown in  Figure Â  3 b, the phase  image clearly shows that anti parallel state exists in the striped  adjacent domain, indicating that 1 is of the uniaxial ferroelectric,  agreeing with structural analysis. Faint band in the topographic  image may be caused by 222F2 type ferro elastic phase transition  (FigureÂ 3a).  The most important inherent characteristic of ferro electrics is the switchable spontaneous polarization. In order  to verify switchable spontaneous polarization, we first performed  the measurements of the local lateral PFM phase and amplitude  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/44dfb958d59fb1567b43dbaea771adb25a03e3c51fda57b55f0afc7d2991784f-1727101177.jpg)  \nFigure   3.â  PFM images of 1. a) Topographic image. b) Lateral PFM phase image. c) Dependence of lateral PFM phase and amplitude signals on tip  voltage for a local point. d) Lateral PFM phase image of the as grown-crystal surface. e) Lateral PFM phase image after applying DC bias voltage  $+92$  Â V  in the red box. f) Lateral PFM phase image after further applying DC bias voltage  $-92\\;\\lor$   in the smaller green box.  \n\nunder the variable DC bias voltage. As depicted in FigureÂ  3c,  the phase and amplitude under variable DC bias voltage show  definite hysteresis loop and typical butterfly curve, which confirms the switchable polarization. To further demonstrate visual  switchable polarization, a series of domain reversal operations are clearly shown in FigureÂ 3dâf. As shown in FigureÂ 3d,  selected region presents a state of monodomain. When a   $+92\\;\\mathrm{V}$    DC bias voltage is applied in the red box, the polarization direction appears reverse and the color of the corresponding phase  image changes from yellow to blue (FigureÂ 3e). Then, we further  applied  $-92\\;\\mathrm{V}$   DC bias voltage in the smaller green box and the  state of polarization can be switched back (FigureÂ  3f). All the  above PFM measurement results prove that 1 possesses switchable spontaneous polarization.  \n\nVariable-temperature second harmonic generation (SHG)  response plays an important role in confirming the para electricâ ferroelectric phase transition. At   $300\\ \\mathrm{K}_{\\ast}$  , the SHG intensity of 1  is comparable to that of   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{4}$   (KDP) (Figure   $\\mathrm{S4a}$  , Supporting  Information), which proves that 1 crystallizes in the noncentro symmetric space group. One can see from  Figure   4 a that  as the temperature increases to around   $T_{\\mathsf{c}},$   the SHG intensity  abruptly decreases to about 0.07 times of that KDP (Figure S4b,  Supporting Information), and there is no further change in  SHG intensity in HTP. The detectable SHG response confirms  that the HTP has the non-centro symmetric space group  C 222.  It is worth noting that at around   $T_{\\mathsf{c}},$   abrupt decrease of the SHG  intensity is consistent with the feature of first-order transition  phase. We noticed the color change of 1 at different temperature and performed variable-temperature solid state UVâvis  absorption spectra of 1. As the temperature increases from 303  to   $433\\;\\mathrm{\\textrm{K}},$   the crystal color of 1 gradually changes from red to  black, which manifests that 1 owns thermo ch rom is m (inset of  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Output\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
