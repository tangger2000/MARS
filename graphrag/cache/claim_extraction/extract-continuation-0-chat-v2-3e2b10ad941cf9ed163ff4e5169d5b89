Encouragingly, the TPE-S-based device retains   $82\\%$   of its initial PCE,  while the PEDOT:PSS-based devices show a   $46\\%$   PCE drop.  \n\nTo understand the performance difference caused by the  two different HTMs, we performed both steady-state-photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) experiments to  examine the charge transfer properties at the interface between  perovskite and HTM. As shown in  Figure   3 a,b, the PL of CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  film at   $636\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   is quenched effectively by both HTLs.  However, a more efficient PL quenching was observed for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film deposited on the TPE-S layer, indicating that the  TPE-S layer can more efficiently extract holes from the CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film. Moreover, the decline of the PL signal over time for  the TPE-S-based film is faster than the PEDOT:PSS-base film  in the TRPL experiment (Figure 3b). The fitted PL lifetime for  the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film on quartz substrate is about 3.51 ns,  whereas the PL lifetimes of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films on the PEDOT:PSS  and TPE-S decreased to 1.46 and 0.65  ns, respectively. The  more efficient steady-state PL quenching and the faster PL  decay of the perovskite film on TPE-S suggest that hole extraction by TPE-S is more efficient than PEDOT:PSS.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/5e32a426974c01d12fc53cd8aadf747a19a9d372c9106b71830d945a6bc7406b-1723835294.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   a,b) The contact angles of DMF on PEDOT:PSS (a) and TPE-S (b). c,d) Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of   $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$  film on PEDOT:PSS (c) and TPE-S (d). e) XRD result of   $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films with different HTMs.  \n\nTo understand the pass iv ation effect at the interface between  TPE-S and the perovskite, we performed X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS) experiments. Figure  3c shows that   $\\operatorname{Pb}\\,4\\mathrm{f}$  peaks evidently shift toward lower binding energy compared to  the reference sample. In addition, Figure S8 (Supporting Information) shows that the N 1s peak of TPE-S shifts toward higher  binding energy, indicating that the electron density around   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   is increased and that around   $\\mathrm{N}^{-3}$   is decreased, which disclosed that the electron lone pairs on the N atom could interact  with   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   to form coordination bonds. More importantly,  strong  $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\cal{S}$   and S–I interactions could also be confirmed from  the observation of a clear shift toward higher binding energy  for   $\\textsl{S2p}$   peaks (Figure 3d), which have been employed to passivate the interface trap states, thereby contributing to the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  enhancement and improving the device performance.  \n\nTo investigate the morphology of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film on the two  different HTM layers, X-ray characterization techniques such  as powder X-ray diffract o meter (XRD) and scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) were employed.  Figure  $^{4\\mathrm{c},\\mathrm{d}}$   shows the growth  of perovskite poly crystalline structure on the two different HTM  layers. Dramatic difference is found in the SEM images of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films, showing that TPE-S can modulate the crystallinity of the perovskite and facilitate the formation of dense,  high-quality perovskite poly crystalline.
