Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Based on this novel ETL, a champion PCE for   $\\mathrm{n{-}i{-}p}$    PSCs of up to   $22.77\\%$   has been achieved with significantly  improved device environmental stability, retaining over   $95\\%$    of the initial PCE at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   after   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$  , when exposed to less  than   $40–60\\%$   humidity. All these excellent achievements can  be solely attributed to the RCQs-doped   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL and demonstrate that inexpensive RCQs are simple but extremely effective  additives for efficient ETLs in stable high-performance PSCs, as  well as in other perovskite-based op to electronic devices.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis of N, S-RCQs : In this study, the N, S-RCQs were synthesized  by the sol vo thermal method.  First, L-Cystine (0.125  g) and   $O_{\\l}$  -phenyl ene dia mine   $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\,g})$   were dissolved in   $\\mathsf{l o~m L}$   of ethanol, and  then the solution was transferred into a  $50\\,\\mathsf{m L}$   Teflon-lined stainless-steel  autoclave. Subsequently, the autoclave was kept in an oven at  $220~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $^{12\\ h}$   and then was cooled down to room temperature naturally. After  that,   $2~\\mathsf{m L}$   of the original solution of N, S-RCQs was added into   $4~\\mathsf{m L}$    of NaOH solution   $({\\bar{1}}.25\\,\\mathsf{\\ m o l\\ L^{-1}})$  ) and centrifuged at   $10~000$    rpm for   $10\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$  . Then, the precipitate was added with ethanol to dissolve, which  was filtered by a cylindrical filtration membrane filter   $(0.22~\\upmu m)$   twice.  Finally, the solution went through spin drying in a rotary steaming device  to obtain a red brown product.  \n\nPreparation of the   $S n O_{2^{-}}R C Q s$   Precursor : The synthesized N, S-RCQs  powder was first dispersed in deionized water at a concentration of   $3\\,\\textsf{m g}\\,\\mathsf{m L^{-1}}$  . Then, it was added to an aqueous solution of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   at a  volume ratio of   $0\\%$  ,   $0.5\\%$  ,   $\\rceil\\%$  , and   $1.5\\%$  , followed by ultrasonic ation  for  $15~\\mathsf{m i n}$  .  \n\nPreparation of the Perovskite Precursor : FAI,   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  , MABr, and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$    were dissolved in a mixed solvent of   $N,N$  -dimethyl form amide/ dimethyl sulfoxide   $(\\mathsf{D M S O})=4.1$   at a concentration of   $1.35\\ m o l\\ \\mathsf{L}^{-1}$  .  Next, CsI was dissolved in  $1\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$   of DMSO solvent at a concentration  of   $1.1\\ m o^{\\mid\\mathsf{L}^{-1}}$  . The two bottles of the solution were placed together on  a hot plate at   $65~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $2~\\mathsf{h}$  . Then,   $50~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of the CsI solution was added  to the perovskite precursor solution and the mixture was stirred at room  temperature overnight. Finally, the solution was filtered for perovskite   $(\\mathsf{C s}_{0.05}\\mathsf{F A}_{0.81}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.14}\\mathsf{P b I}_{2.55}\\mathsf{B r}_{0.45})$   preparation.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : ITO glasses were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath  sequentially with cleanser, deionized water, acetone, and iso prop an ol,  followed by drying with an   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   gun. Thereafter, the cleaned glasses were  treated in a UV–ozone chamber for   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . The   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   solution (Alfa)  was spin coated on the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for   $40~\\mathrm{s}$  , followed  by annealing at   $150\\,\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $30\\ \\ m i n$  . The   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathsf{R C Q s}$   solution also  underwent the same procedures. The substrate was then cool down to  room temperature on a spin coater. Thereafter, the perovskite precursors   $(\\mathsf{C s}_{0.05}\\mathsf{F A}_{0.81}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.14}\\mathsf{P b I}_{2.55}\\mathsf{B r}_{0.45})$   were dropped on the reheated substrates,  followed by spin coating at 1500 rpm for   $20~\\mathrm{s}$  and at   $5500~\\mathsf{r p m}$   for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  ,  respectively. A chl oro benzene (CB) anti solvent was used in the last  10 s. As-deposited films were later transferred onto a hot plate and then  annealed at   $130~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$  . Afterward, spiro-OMeTAD (Sigma) in CB   $(70\\,\\,{\\sf m g\\,\\,m L^{-1}})$   was deposited on the perovskite films at   $3000\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for   $40~\\mathrm{s}$  . The device was put in a dry box and oxidized overnight (humidity  of   $20\\%$   at  $26\\,^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C})$  ). Finally, the semi-finished devices were transferred into  a vacuum chamber for the deposition of   $\\mathsf{M o O}_{3}$     $(5\\ \\mathsf{n m})$   and then of the  Au   $(100\\:\\mathsf{n m})$   electrode under a base pressure of  $4.0\\times10^{-4}\\;{\\sf P a}$  .
