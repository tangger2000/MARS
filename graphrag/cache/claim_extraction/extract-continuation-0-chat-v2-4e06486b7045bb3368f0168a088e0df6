Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials and Chemicals : Cesium chloride (CsCl, Alfa Aesar,   $99.99\\%,$  ),  bismuth chloride   $\\left(\\mathsf{B i C}\\right|_{3}$  , Alfa Aesar,   $99.99\\%$  ), tin chloride   $(\\mathsf{S n C l}_{2}$  , Alfa  Aesar,   $99.999\\%,$  ), hydrochloric acid (HCl ,37 wt% in water, Sinopharm  Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China), hydrobromic acid (HBr,   $57~\\mathsf{w t\\%}$   in  water, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China), hydriodic acid  (HI,   $57\\ \\mathrm{wt\\%}$   in water, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China)  were the starting reagents. All the chemicals were used without further  purification, unless otherwise stated.  \n\nSynthesis—  ${\\mathsf{.C s}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S n C I}}_{6}{\\mathrm{:}}$  :Bi : An amount of   $336.72~\\mathsf{m g}$   (  $\\mathsf{\\Omega}^{2}\\mathsf{\\ m m o l}$  )   $99.99\\%$  CsCl,   $189.60~\\mathrm{mg}$   (  $\\left.\\daleth\\,\\mathsf{m m o l}\\right]$  )   $\\mathsf{S n C l}_{2}$  , and   $3.20{-}94.52~\\mathsf{m g}~(0.01{-}0.3~\\mathsf{m m o l})$   ${\\mathsf{B i C}}|_{3}$   powders were added in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) container  with   $4.0\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$   of   $37\\%$   hydrochloric acid. The container was placed in  a muffle furnace and kept at   $780~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\mathsf{\\Omega}_{\\mathsf{P}}{\\mathsf{h}}$  . Crystals were obtained  by slowly cooling the solution down to room temperature over the  course of   $20~\\mathsf{h}$  . White crystals of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{\\cdot}\\mathsf{B i}^{3+}$   could be separated by  immediate filtration and washed with methanol. The product yields  were between 332.25 and   $408.65\\ \\mathrm{\\meg}$   (  $\\!59.10\\!-\\!72.69\\%$   yield calculated  based on the total Sn content).  \n\nFabrication of LED Devices : White LED was constructed by combining  UV LED chips   $(365\\;\\mathsf{n m},)$  ), commercial yellow phosphors   $(\\mathsf{B a}_{2}\\mathsf{S r}_{2}\\mathsf{S i O}_{4}{:\\mathsf{E u}}^{2+}$  and   $\\mathsf{G a A S i N}_{3}{:}\\mathsf{E u}^{2+}$  ) and the present   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{\\cdot}\\mathsf{B i}^{3+}$   blue phosphor. The  chip was first fixed on the bottom of a reflector. Then, commercial yellow  and the blue phosphors were mixed with silicone thoroughly, and the  obtained phosphor–silicone mixture was coated on the surface of the  LED chips to produce white LEDs.  \n\nMeasurement and Characterization : The phase determination of the  obtained samples was carried out by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (D8  ADVANCE, Bruker, using a   $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K o}$  rotating anode). Diffuse reflectance  ( R ) spectra were measured with powder samples and calibrated by  measuring a reference material   $({\\mathsf{M g O}}$   powder) at the same time. The  absorption coefficient  $\\alpha$   was obtained by using the Kubelka–Munk theory   $(\\upharpoonright\\ -R)^{2}/2R\\,=\\,\\alpha/s$   ( s  is the scattering coefficient). Depth-profile XPS  spectra were recorded on an AXIS Supra, using an X-ray beam focused  to an area of  $2\\ m m^{2}$   on the sample, and with an etching at the rate of   $1\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   for   $35\\ \\mathsf{s}$  . PLQY, steady-state, and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra  were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 980 spectrometer with  a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (R928), equipped with a xenon lamp  and a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) module (diode  laser excitation at   $\\lambda=375~\\mathsf{n m}^{\\dagger}$  ) and an integrating sphere for absolute  PLQY. The temperature-dependent PL spectra were measured with a  temperature controller system on this basis. The spectra were corrected  for the monochromator wavelength dependence and photomultiplier  response functions provided by the manufacturer. The measurements  were performed using dried, powdered poly crystalline samples. No  filters were used during the TRPL measurement.  \n\nTheoretical Calculations : Defect calculations were performed in the  framework of DFT using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method,  as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP). The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to   $350.0\\;\\mathrm{eV}.$   A 243 atoms supercell  (i.e.,   $3\\times3\\times3$   primitive cells) and the   $\\varGamma$  only   $k$  -mesh were used. While  the standard Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used  for structural relaxations,  the HSE hybrid functional was employed  for total-energy and electronic structure calculations,  because the  HSE hybrid functional provides a reasonable bandgap for   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}$  . The  atomic coordinates of the defect structures were relaxed until the total  force on each atom was less than   $0.03\\ \\mathsf{e V}\\,\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{-1}$  , while the lattice parameters  were constrained to the PBE-optimized values for the perfect host structure  to meet the dilute limit condition. For charged defects, the common  posteriori corrections were applied to the calculated total energies to  correct the finite-size effects.  For a defect ( D ) in a charge state   $q$  , the  formation enthalpy  $\\Delta H_{D,q}\\;(\\mu,\\,E_{F})$   was calculated through the equation  \n\n$$\n\\Delta H_{D,q}\\left(\\mu,E_{\\mathsf{F}}\\right)\\!=\\!\\left(E_{D,q}-E_{\\mathsf{H}}\\right)\\!-\\!\\sum\\!n_{\\alpha}\\mu_{\\alpha}\\!+\\!q\\left(E_{\\mathsf{F}}\\!+\\!E_{\\mathsf{V}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere   $(E_{D,q}~-~E_{\\mathrm{H}})$   is the energy difference between the defect and  host supercells,   $n_{\\alpha}$  indicates the number of   $\\alpha$  atoms added   $(n_{\\alpha}>0)$  or removed   $(n_{\\alpha}<0)$   when a defect is formed, and   $\\mu_{\\alpha}$  is the chemical  potential of the   $\\alpha$  atom, which can be expressed with respect to  that of the elemental phase   $(\\mu_{\\alpha}^{\\mathrm{{\\scriptsize~e}l}})$   by   $\\mu_{\\alpha}=\\mu_{\\alpha}^{\\mathrm{\\scriptsize~\\dot{e}l~}}+\\,\\Delta\\mu_{\\alpha}.\\,\\,\\,E_{\\mathrm{\\scriptsizeF}}$   is the Fermi  level referred to the host VBM,   $E_{\\vee}$   The   $\\mu_{\\alpha}$  value varies depending on  the experimental conditions. The allowed   $\\mu_{\\alpha}$  values are determined  using three steps.
