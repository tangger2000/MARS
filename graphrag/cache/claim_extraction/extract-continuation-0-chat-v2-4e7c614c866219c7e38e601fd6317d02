The formation of   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$  , similar to the   $[\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}]^{2-}$  , combined with the  \n\ndefect tolerance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  , also explaining the crystal structure stability upon a few percentages of Bi alloying.  \n\nHere, we like to discuss more details in the electronic  structure of pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   and Bi-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   with   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   defect complex in Figure 5c,d. For pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  ,  the VBM is derived from   $\\mathrm{Cl}\\ 3\\mathrm{p}$   states, while the CBM consists of the antibonding states of   $\\mathrm{sn\\5s}$   and Cl 3p orbitals. For  Bi-doped  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   with the   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   model, a fully occupied  defect band consisting of Cl 3p and Bi 6s orbitals is formed at   $0.99~\\mathrm{eV}$   above the VBM, which is responsible for the experimentally observed additional absorption peaks   $(\\approx\\!400\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   for  the Bi-doped  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   samples as discussed above. Figure 5e  depicts a schematic energy diagram for Bi-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  .  It is known that Bi 6s orbitals are much deeper than   $\\mathrm{Sn\\5s}$    orbitals.  Therefore, while  $\\mathrm{Sn}$   can easily lose its 5 s  electrons  and exhibit the nominal  $+4$   oxidation state, Bi can hardly lose  its 6s electrons to be oxidized to the oxidation state of   $+5$   (in  fact, no  $\\mathrm{Bi^{5+}}$  -based chlorides such as  $\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}$   have been reported  in literatures). The pseudo closed   $\\operatorname{Bi}^{3+}\\,6s^{2}$   orbitals hybridize  with   $\\mathrm{Cl}\\ 3\\mathrm{p}$   orbitals, forming antibonding states (denoted as   $\\mathrm{VBM^{\\prime}}$   as used above) above the nonbonding Cl   $3\\mathrm{p}$   orbitalsderived VBM and thus a reduced bandgap (denoted as   ${E_{\\mathrm{g}}}^{\\prime}$  ).  On the other hand, as the unoccupied Bi 6p orbitals are  higher than the   $\\mathrm{Sn\\5s}$   orbitals, the   $\\mathrm{sn\\5s}$  -derived CBM is  almost not affected by the Bi doping. In short, the incorporated Bi in the   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   state leads to an up-shifted VBM but  an unchanged CBM. Since our material showed a blue emission with PLQY of   $78.9\\%$  , we hypothesize such high PLQY is  caused by the excitons trapped by the   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$   pyramid which  are strongly confined in the 0D  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   per ovsk ites, similar  to high PLQY observed in the low-dimensional halide perov­ skites reported by Ma and co-workers.  In our case, the  luminescent   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$   pyramids are well surrounded by the  wide bandgapped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   matrix, which serves to localize  the excitons and enhance radiative recombination, in analogy  to type I core–shell structure for traditional III–V and II–VI  semiconductor nano crystals. At higher Bi concentrations,  however, the well isolation of   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$   pyramids are no  longer preserved and formation of neighboring   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$   clusters would appear, which not only result in reduced exciton  localization, but also cause severe self-absorption, leading to  PLQY degradation. Thereby, the trade-off between the isolation effect and the amount of the luminescent centers leads  to the PLQY maximum of  $78.9\\%$   at   $x=2.75\\%$  .  \n\nOur   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6};x\\mathrm{Bi}$   samples possess high PLQYs and excellent stability, promising potential application for lighting and  back light display. Here, we constructed white LED by mixing   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}{:}2.75\\%\\mathrm{Bi}$   with yellow phosphors   $(\\mathrm{Ba}_{2}\\mathrm{Sr}_{2}\\mathrm{SiO}_{4};\\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$  and   $\\mathrm{GaAlSiN}_{3}{:E u}^{2+}$  )  to  demonstrate  their  application.   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}{:2.75\\%}$   Bi with blue emission and yellow phosphor  are mixed with curable resin, coated on a commercially available   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   LED chip, and cured. The corresponding electro luminescent spectrum is shown in  Figure   6 a. The CIE  xy coordinates of the white-LED output are (0.36, 0.37) related to  a warm white with a correlated color temperature of 4486 K  (Figure 6b). As shown in the inset image, the working device  based on the mixed phosphors emitted bright white light,  which demonstrates that the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi per ovsk ites are promising for lighting applications.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/346c302044f95bfa3ee7175d68dc92c35d6b4feb9bb44cafbe138a4d59625745-1723824436.jpg)  \nFigure 6.  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{:}2.75\\%$  Bi-based lightemit diodes (LEDs) with warm white emission. b) CIE color coordinates  corresponding to white-LED device and (inset) photo of operating LED.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn conclusion, we have reported bismuth doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   perov­ skite variant with a blue emission at  $455\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and an outstanding  PLQY up to  $78.9\\%$  , the highest value reported for lead-free perovskites emitting blue light. Careful material characterization  and first-principle calculations revealed that  $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   is incorporated  into   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   matrix at the Sn site, and would preferably form   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   defect complex which is responsible for the strong  blue emission. Thanks to the large decomposition enthalpy  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  , our blue emitting phosphors demonstrated  excellent thermal and water stability. Finally, by integrating this  phosphor with commercial yellow phosphors and 365 nm LED  chip, we demonstrated a warm white LED. We believe our findings will open up new avenues for exploration of novel lead-free  perovskite emitters.  \n\n# 4.
