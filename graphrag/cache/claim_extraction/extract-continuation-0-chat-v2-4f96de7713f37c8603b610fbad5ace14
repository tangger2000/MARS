It is recognized that accumulated   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   in human body  can cause numerous brain related symptoms such as intellectual disability. The  high solubility of the per ovsk ites in water  renders their leakage threatening local biological system severely. Therefore, nontoxic  and stable perovskite alternatives must be  urgently developed.  \n\nLead halide per ovsk ites show excellent op to electronic properties but are  unsatisfactory in terms of stability and toxicity. Herein, bismuth (Bi)-doped  lead-free inorganic per ovsk ites  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}$  :Bi are reported as blue emissive  phosphors. Upon Bi doping, the originally non luminous  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}$   exhibits a  highly efficient deep-blue emission at  $\\mathbf{455\\nm}$  , with a Stokes shift of   $\\mathsf{106\\,n m}$    and a high photo luminescence quantum yield (PLQY) close to  $\\mathbf{80\\%}$  . Hybrid  density functional theory calculations suggest the preferred formation of   $[\\mathsf{B i}_{\\mathsf{S n}}\\!+\\!\\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{C l}}]$   defect complex, which is believed to be responsible for the optical  absorption and the associated blue emission. The  $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{s n C l}_{6}$  :Bi also shows  impressive thermal and water stability due to its inorganic nature and the  formation of protective BiOCl layer. White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are  constructed using   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}$  :Bi and commercial yellow phosphors combined  with commercial UV LED chips, giving the Commission Internationale de  I’Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates of (0.36, 0.37). This work represents a  significant step toward the realization of highly efficient, stable, and environmentally benign next-generation solid-state lighting.  \n\nSome recent reports have examined  various substitutions of   $\\mathrm{Pb}$  with nontoxic metal elements, such as Sn, Ge,  Sb, and Bi.  Nevertheless, such replacements always suffer from the deterioration of PLQY and/or stability. Some of the  recently reported Bi- and Sb-based perovskites demonstrate the highest PLQYs  of   $19\\%$   and   $46\\%$  , respectively,  but are  still far lower than those of the lead-halide  \n\n# 1.

Early studies show that tin-based analogs   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{sn}\\mathrm{X}_{3}$     $(\\mathsf{X}=\\mathsf{C l}$  , Br, I) exhibit PLQY as low as   $0.14\\%.^{[7]}$   Interestingly,  Ma and co-workers recently reported luminescent 0D hybrid tin  halides   $(C_{4}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{14}\\mathrm{X})_{4}\\mathrm{SnX}_{6}$     $(\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Br},\\,\\mathrm{I}$  ) with PLQYs up to   $95\\%$  .   However, because of the easy oxidation of   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   into  $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   as well  as the instability of the A site organics, these materials suffer  from low stability against moisture and heat.  On the other  hand, it is known that   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  -based perovskite variants   $\\left(\\mathrm{A}_{2}\\mathrm{SnX}_{6}\\right)$    exhibit much improved stability than   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$  -based per ovsk ites  along with some promising op to electronic properties such  as direct bandgaps.  As shown in  Figure   1 a,   $\\mathrm{A}_{2}\\mathrm{SnX}_{6}$   adopts  \n\nLead halide per ovsk ites have been studied intensively for photovoltaic absorbers, and, more recently, they attract attention due to  their great potential for light-emitting applications.  This is mainly  spurred by their outstanding intrinsic features, including easy proces sibi lit y such that their thin films are formed by low-temperature solution processes, high photo luminescence quantum yield  (PLQY,  ${\\approx}90\\%$  ), bipolar carrier transport, narrow full width at half  maximum   $(\\mathrm{FWHM}=12{-}25~\\mathrm{nm})$  ), and wide color gamut   $(\\approx\\!150\\%$    National Television Standards Committee (NTSC)).

However, the  photo luminescence properties of these compounds have been  rarely examined, and there is only one report, to our best knowledge, showing PLQY as low as  $0.48\\%$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}S n I_{6}}$  .  Therefore,  it remains as an open question whether lead-free perovskite  can compete with lead-based analogs in terms of luminescence  properties.  \n\nOn the other hand, impurity doping has demonstrated to  be an effective way to control the physical properties and even  to induce new functions for metal halide per ovsk ites similar  to conventional group III–V and II–VI compound semiconductors.  For example,   $\\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$   doping to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{3}$   perovskite  nano crystals (NCs) leads to characteristic emission from  $\\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$  .   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   ions are also expected to work as luminescent centers for  lead halide per ovsk ites, as   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   has an ionic radius and electronic configuration of   $4\\mathrm{f}^{14}5\\mathrm{d}^{10}6\\mathrm{s}^{2}$   similar to   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  .  Indeed,  Zhou and co-workers have prepared the Bi-doped lead halide  per ovsk ites and confirmed ultrabroad photo luminescence and  electroluminescence.  \n\nIn this work, we chose  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   as a host and   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   as the luminescent dopant for a lead-free, stable, and efficient photo lu minescent material. The as-synthesized materials preserved the crystal  structure of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}S n X_{6},}$  , while   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   replaced   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   he t ero valent ly.
