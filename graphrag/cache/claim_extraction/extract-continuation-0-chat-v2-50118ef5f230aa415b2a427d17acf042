Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As shown  in Figure 3c, the OER current density of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   shows no  evident degradation after a prolonged OER tests, indicating its  high OER catalytic stability. All the above results explicitly demonstrate that the   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   shows a remarkable enhanced  OER electro catalytic activity in comparison with   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   and  NF electrodes.  \n\nTo investigate the HER performance of as-obtained   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/$  NF electrode material, the corresponding electrochemical  measurements have also been carried out under alkaline condition. As shown in Figure 3d, the polarization curve of the bare  NF electrode shows negligible catalytic activity, whereas the current density increases obviously after growing pristine   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$    and   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   catalysts. The polarization curve of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$    achieves a low over potential of   $110~\\mathrm{mV}$   at a current density of   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , whereas higher over potential of 210 and   $265~\\mathrm{mV}$    are demanded for  $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   and NF electrodes, respectively. For  further assessment of the HER reaction kinetics, electro chemical impedance spectroscopy tests were conducted. As shown  in Figure 3e, the Nyqusit plots revealed that the charge-transfer  resistance of the   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$     $(6.6~\\Omega)$   is obviously smaller than  that of  $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$     $(24.4\\;\\Omega)$   and NF   $(56.3\\ \\Omega)$  , suggesting that the   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   catalyst possesses a faster charge-transfer capacity  during the HER process. To further evaluate the electro chemical st abilities of the   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   electrodes, long-term cyclic  volta mm ogram (CV) cycling tests and chrono am pero metric  response tests were further carried out. As shown in Figure 3f;  and Figure S9 (Supporting Information), the   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   electrode exhibits insignificant degradation of current density after   $5000\\;\\mathrm{CV}$   cycling and a long period of   $10\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$   tests, confirming the  superior st abilities of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   for the HER process under  alkaline condition. Based on above results, the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   electrode material has been proved to be a superior  bi functional electro catalyst for both HER and OER.  \n\nTo gain an in-depth understanding of the intrinsic electrical  behavior of the   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   catalyst, the first-principle calculations  have first been conducted. As shown in  Figure   4 a, both the calculated density of states (DOS) of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   and pristine   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$    catalyst are continuous around the Fermi level, suggesting their  intrinsic metallic characters. Remarkably, the DOS of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$    near the Fermi level is stronger than that of pristine   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$  , indicating that the electrical behavior of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$  , especially the concentration of charge carrier and the electronic conductivity, can  be further enhanced by the introduction of anion   $_\\mathrm{N}$   atoms. The  higher electrical conductivity will be favor of the improvement  of the electron transfer capacity, bringing the enhanced OER  and HER catalytic activities.  \n\nMoreover, the SEM and TEM images show that the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   materials possess more loose and porous  structure than that of pristine   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$  , suggesting the   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   electrode may provide larger active surface area  for catalytic reaction. In order to experimentally confirm this  viewpoint, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance   $\\left(C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\right)$    measurements were performed. As shown in Figure 4b; and  Figure S11 (Supporting Information), the corresponding   $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$    values of   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   electrodes can be calculated by the slope extracted from the linear relationship of the  current density against the increasing scan rates. The   $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$  of   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   is evaluated to be  $37.5\\;\\mathrm{mF}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , which is 4.6 times  higher than that of   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   (  $(C_{\\mathrm{dl}}=8.1\\;\\mathrm{mF\\;cm}^{-2})$  ), indicating the  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/efce1e27c128fa23e9b0bb393656ea9734934f48230707219620bd2754da86fe-1727114890.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a) Calculated density of states for  $\\mathsf{N}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{N i}_{3}\\mathsf{S}_{2}$   and pristine  $\\mathsf{N i}_{3}\\mathsf{S}_{2}$  .
