Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The inset of Figure 3c shows a photograph  of PeLED with   $40\\%$   FPMATFA operating at   $5\\ \\mathrm{V.}$   Detailed performance of the devices with different compositions is shown  in  Table   2 .  \n\nIn order to get more insight on the origin of EQE enhancement with FPMATFA pass iv ation, we quantize the trap density  by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement.  We  fabricated both hole-only devices (structure: ITO/poly-TPD/ perovskite/CBP/  $\\mathrm{{/MoO_{3}/A g})}$   and electron-only devices (structure:   $\\mathrm{ITO/S n O}_{2}/$  perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al), respectively. Three distinct  regions could be clearly identified from the   $I{-}V$  curves including  Ohmic, trap-filled limited as well as SCLC regions. We extract  hole and electron trap density from hole and electron only  devices, respectively, using equation   $N_{\\mathrm{trans}}\\;=\\;2\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}/(q L^{2})$  ,  where the  $\\varepsilon_{0},\\,\\varepsilon_{r}\\,q_{:}$  , and  $L$   are the vacuum permittivity, the relative  dielectric constant, elementary charge, and the thickness of the  \n\nTable 1.   Parameters of the perovskite films with various additives. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/aca0b8e62fc41c6987b2a24faa4c92b7d42fbb3823b1d3f145ba39730b928831-1727100347.jpg)  \na) TRPL measurement is conducted at a wavelength of   $369\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   and an excitation intensity of   $0.6\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  ;  b) PLQY measurement is conducted at a wavelength of   $430\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  and an excitation intensity of   $0.6\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  .  \n\nperovskite films, respectively.  As shown in  Figure 4 a–d, the  density of hole traps reaches   $2.52\\times10^{16}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   after incorporation of  $40\\%$   FPMATFA, which is one order of magnitude lower  than the control device   $\\left(N_{\\mathrm{trans}}=1.18\\times10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\right)$  . The density  of electron traps also reduces obviously from   $9.74\\,\\times\\,10^{16}$   to   $6.72\\times10^{16}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . These results further demonstrate the dual  pass iv ation effect of FPMATFA. In Figure  4e, we summarize the density of hole and electron traps, PLQY and EQE  of perovskite films as a function of the content of FPMATFA  (Figure S10, Supporting Information). It clearly demonstrates  the better pass iv ation effect of FPMATFA, and further proves  that lower electron/hole trap density results in higher PLQY as  well as better device performance.  \n\nThe traps at crystal lite surface and ion migration along  grain boundaries are the main reasons for hysteresis and  instability in perovskite devices.  The hysteresis is  expected to be more severe in mixed-halide perovskite devices  than that in single-halide perovskite devices because the traps  and ion migration also cause phase segregation to domains  with different bandgaps.  For this reason, we measure  the hysteresis of our PeLEDs with   $40\\%$     $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   and  FPMATFA as additive, respectively. As shown in  Figure 5 a,b,  both the control device and device with   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   or   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$   show severe hysteresis, whereas the device  with FPMATFA shows a relatively slight hysteresis. Transient EL measurement also supports the results of hysteresis  measurement. As shown in Figure  5c, the inject current of  the control device gradually increases under pulse voltages  resulting from high trap density, while the PeLEDs with   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   and FPMATFA show a relative steady current. Normalized luminance under pulse voltage is shown in  Figure 5d. The FPMATFA device shows a shorter rising time,  indicating lower trap density.  This result also suggests that  FPMATFA has better pass iv ation effect. It is also possible  that the stronger   $\\mathrm{I-Pb}$   bonding with addition of FPMATFA  suppresses the halide migrations and thus reduces the  hysteresis.  \n\nWe finally measured the EL spectrum and operational stability of our mixed-halide PeLEDs. The thermal, optical, and  atmospheric al stability of the bare films were first examined  (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The FPMATFA-passivated films have better thermal and optical stability than  the films with   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   due to the pass iv ation effect.  Nevertheless, it shows relatively poor atmospheric al stability  which might be due to the   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  -absorbing TFA ligands. Our  devices were tested in   $\\Nu_{2}$   glove box with   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   level   ${<}5$   ppm  to avoid the influence of humidity. The evolution of EL  spectrum of the PeLEDs under different voltages is shown  in Figure  5e. The EL peak gradually redshifts with applied  voltage increasing from 3 to   $6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   for the control device due  to phase segregation. The EL spectrum becomes more stable  after incorporation of   $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$  . In contrast, the EL peak  position and FWHM remain unchanged for the device with  FPMATFA, demonstrating a superior spectrum stability after  pass iv ation. The operational stability was measured at a constant current density of   $2.5~\\mathrm{mA~cm}^{-2}$  . The   $T_{50}$   of the devices  increases from 0.25 to 0.8, 4.5, and   $^{14\\mathrm{~h~}}$  , respectively, with   $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$  , and FPMATFA passiva- tion (Figure 5f). In addition, the device with FPMATFA also  shows much better storage stability than the control device.  The EQE of the control device decreases to   $50\\%$   of their initial value after 2 months, while the device with FPMATFA  is stable without degradation (Figure S12, Supporting  Information).  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we have synthesized FPMATFA to simultaneously passivate lead and halide defects in MHPs.
