Both the Fermi energy level  (  $\\cdot E_{\\mathrm{F}}=E_{\\mathrm{cutoff}}-21.22\\;\\mathrm{eV})$  ) and conduction band (CB) shift upward  after PBGH modification. The CBs of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/P B G H}$    and perovskite films are determined to be  − 4.10,   $-3.84$  , and   $-3.84~\\mathrm{eV},$  , respectively (Figure 2c; Figure S4, Supporting Information). The elevated   $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}$   and CB can coordinate the interface  energy level alignment, reduce electron transfer barrier, and  enhance charge transport of the corresponding device.  Kelvin  probe force microscopy (KPFM) was also conducted, and the  average surface potential of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film is increased from 43 to   $60\\,\\mathrm{\\mV}$   after PBGH modification (Figure  2d; Figure S5, Supporting Information), which has the same trend as the  UPS  results.  The much more uniform surface potential across the   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/P B G H}$   surface is beneficial for local carrier transport.  \n\nTo further investigate the carrier recombination in the  perovskite film and carrier transport dynamics at the   $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2}/$  perovskite interface, steady–state photo luminescence (SSPL)  and time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) measurements  were conducted. As shown in Figure 2e, excited from the perovskite side by using a   $510\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   laser, PBGH-modified perovskite  film exhibits a higher steady–state PL peak than the film grown  on bare glass. The TRPL curves fitted using the biexponential decay equation of   $I(\\mathfrak{t})=I_{0}+A_{1}\\mathrm{exp}(\\cdot t/\\tau_{1})+A_{2}\\mathrm{exp}(\\cdot t/\\tau_{2})$  , are  depicted in Figure  2f, and the corresponding carrier lifetime  are listed in Table S4 (Supporting Information).  The average  time constant   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ave}})$  , calculated by the formula   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ave}}=\\left(A_{1}\\tau_{1}^{2}\\right)^{-}+$     $A_{2}\\tau_{2}^{\\;2})/(A_{1}\\tau_{1}+A_{2}\\tau_{2}),$  , is increased from 309.58 to 591.72 ns after  \n\nPBGH modification. The increased PL intensity and TRPL lifetime indicate restrained non radiative recombination after substrate modification with PBGH, owing to the passivated interfacial defects and the optimized perovskite grain qualities.  \n\nBy contrast to the SSPL and TRPL results of the perovskite films without ETL, the samples deposited on glass/  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   substrates exhibit diametrically opposed tendency. As  shown in Figure   $2\\mathrm{g}$   (excited from the glass side), the tremendous quenching of steady–state PL intensity indicates that  more effective electron extraction occurs in the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{PBGH}/$  perovskite film.  In addition, it is notable that the PL peak  position shows a blueshift after PBGH modification, owing to  the reduced defects at buried interface.  The TRPL curves  of the control and PBGH-modified samples are plotted in  Figure   $2\\mathrm{h}$  , and related parameters are summarized in Table  S5 (Supporting Information). Generally, with the existence of  ETL, the fast decay process   $(\\tau_{1})$   relates to the charge extraction and the slow one   $(\\tau_{2})$   is correlated to radiative emissions  of the bulk per ovsk ites.  The electron-transport yield   $(\\phi_{\\mathrm{tr}})$   is  calculated by   $\\phi_{\\mathrm{tr}}=1\\cdot\\!\\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}/\\tau_{\\mathrm{glass}}$  , where   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}$   and   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{glass}}$   is the average  lifetime for the perovskite deposited on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and glass substrate, respectively. The   $\\tau_{1}$   value is diminished from 54.59  ns   $\\mathrm{(SD_{2}/}$  /perovskite) to 24.62  ns   $(\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{PBCH}_{/}}}$  perovskite), and  the electron-transport yield is dramatically increased from   $49.3\\%$   to   $81.4\\%$  , demonstrating the facilitated electrons extraction at the buried interface after PBGH modification.  In  order to observe the interface contact, the cross-sectional SEM  images of the    $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}(\\mathrm{PBGH})$  /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD samples are shown in Figure  2i. Compared to the control film,  fewer boundaries are observed in the PBGH/perovskite film,  and these enlarged grains are beneficial for charge-transport  in the vertical direction. Furthermore, the PBGH-modified  sample shows less pinholes at buried interface and a smoother  surface, meaning better contact of perovskite with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and  Spiro-OMeTAD.  \n\nIn view of the remarkably enhanced charge transfer properties of the PBGH-modified sample, the interaction mechanism of PBGH at the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2.}$  /perovskite interface was explored,  and the schematic diagram is shown in  Figure   3 a. PBGH has  functional groups of guanidyl, ammonium   $\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}\\right)$  , carboxyl   $(-\\mathrm{COOH})$   and halogen anions   $(\\mathrm{Cl^{-}})$  . The guanidyl is designed  to modify the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   films, and the   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$   is introduced to form  hydrogen bond with the iodide ions   $\\left(\\mathrm{I^{-}}\\right)$  . The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to  clarify the chemical environment of the bare   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/}$  PBGH films. As presented in the full XPS spectra (Figure S6,  Supporting Information), N 1s signal can be observed both in  the pure PBGH film and in the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P B G H}$   film but not in  the bare   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   film, illustrating that PBGH was anchored to   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   successfully.
