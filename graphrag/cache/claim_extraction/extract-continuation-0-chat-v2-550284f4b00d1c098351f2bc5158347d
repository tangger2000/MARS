The poor  coverage of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films tends to form shut paths. ZnO nanorods  grown on a colloid seed layer showed not only a good coverage  but also enhanced transmittance over the range of visible wavelengths. The shunts caused by the poor coverage decrease the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and photo current density, as shown in Figure   $5\\mathrm{kJ}$  . In addition, recombination at the perovskite/ZnO interface was suppressed for the cell using the seed layer prepared by the colloid  solution. This work directly proved the important role of the  seed layers for the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods based PSCs.  \n\nOn the other hand, considering the unique structure and  morphology of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods, it is difficult to fabricate high  quality perovskite films on nanorods surfaces. As a result,  preparation of high quality perovskite film with good surface  morphology, grain size, and coverage are another area worthy  of study.  \n\nTo solve this problem, our group has developed a solvent  engineering method to fabricate high quality and uniform  perovskite films.  In our research, PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanorods of different lengths were fabricated and a N,NDimethyl form amide/Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF/DMSO) mixed  solvent was used as an alternative to the usually used DMF to  fabricate perovskite precursor solution. As a control, perovskite  films prepared from pure DMF solvent were deposited on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanorods with lengths of 3 and   $1\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$  , and the surface morphologies of perovskite films are shown in  Figure   6 a,b. It is obvious  that the perovskite films cannot fully cover the surface of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanorods, which is detrimental to the device. The morphology  of perovskite film prepared by DMF/DMSO mixed solution was  shown in Figure 6c. As can be seen, the existence of DMSO  results in a uniform and high quality film with full coverage  of the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods surface. In the mixed solution, the DMF  simply served as a solvent while the DMSO reacts with   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   to  form   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(\\mathrm{DMSO})$   complex. When   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(\\mathrm{DMSO})$   contacts with  MAI, the DMSO is replaced by MAI easily because of its higher  affinity toward   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   compared to DMSO. As a result, DMSO in  the solvent will retard the crystallization of perovskite and lead  to a high property film.  The PSC based on mixed solvents  gained the best PCE of   $6.63\\%$   (Figure 6d). The unexpected  low efficiency may attribute to the poor crystallization of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   layer, and the supposition was proved by the low film  quality as shown in the scanning electron microscope (SEM)  images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns.  \n\nIn order to further improve the quality of crystallization, we  developed a solvent annealing method on basis of the solvent  engineering work.  In this study,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods were fabricated by hydrothermal method either. An ultrathin  $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   film  was deposited on the surface of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods by ALD method.  The perovskite film was prepared by a two-step spin coating  method.   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and MAI precursor solution were prepared by a  mixed solvent DMF/DMSO (MS) and iso prop an ol, respectively.  To fabricate perovskite film,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods were first infiltrated  with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   by spin coating and dried at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . After cooling to  room temperature, the films were immersed in the MAI solution and then dried.

As shown in the figures, the perovskite film  prepared by pure DMF has larger grain size than films based  on pure DMSO, while both films have many pinholes. However, for perovskite film prepared by mixed solution, a uniform  and compact film with less pinholes and smaller grain size was  obtained.  \n\nThe different morphology can be attributed to the different properties of different solvents as mentioned above.  In addition, during this process, we found that the mixed  solvent DMF/DMSO can lead to a mesoporous   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   film,  and the mesoporous structure can provide a larger contact  area between   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   film and MAI solution. The mesoporous  structure promotes the formation of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   when the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   film was immersed in MAI solution. Although all the  obtained   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   films have large grains, there are still some  small pinholes that exist in the film, and the pinholes are  the main reason for poor photovoltaic performance. To solve  this problem, a solvent annealing process is introduced via  annealing the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   film in the ethanol vapor atmosphere.  The surface morph o logie s of perovskite films fabricated from  thermal annealing (TA) and solvent annealing (MA) methods  are shown in Figure 6h–j. As can be seen, after solvent  annealing, the grain size of perovskite films obtained from  three different solvents increased. The pinholes in perovskite  films fabricated from pure DMF and DMSO did not disappear.  While the perovskite films prepared by mixed solvent have  no pinholes in sight. This is because in ethanol atmosphere,  the MAI is dissolved and continue to react with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . As for  perovskite films based on pure DMF and DMSO, pinholes in  the film will be intensified by annealing the solvent annealing.  As a result, the grain size and compactness of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  film are improved after solvent annealing, which is consisted  with the film morphology. Compact films with larger grain  sizes decrease the number of grain boundaries and density of  defects, which are favorable to improve the photovoltaic performance\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (organization<|>our group<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Our group has developed a solvent engineering method to fabricate high quality and uniform perovskite films.
