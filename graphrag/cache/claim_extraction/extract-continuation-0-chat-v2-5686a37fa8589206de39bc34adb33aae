Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

We want to  emphasize that the observed   $78.9\\%$   PLQY here is the highest  one among all lead-free halide per ovsk ites with blue emissions   $(\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Pb}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   QDs:   $46\\%$  ,   $\\mathrm{{\\ODA}_{2}P b B r_{4}}$  :   $22.9\\%)$  ).

The PL  of the products is very stable under ambient atmosphere and  can even resist to water immersion.

To exaggerate the effect of water soaking, we  further soaked our sample in deionized (DI) water for   $96\\textup{h}$  ,  and then measured their remanent PL and XRD (Figure S3b,c,  Supporting Information). Clearly, the PL shape and position  remained unchanged but the intensity slightly decreased;  XRD characterization revealed the presence of BiOCl. We thus  believe that the formation of BiOCl, a hydrolysis product of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi, creates a protective layer encapsulating the luminescent material against further water corrosion, thus leading  to the outstanding water stability. Moreover,   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi also  shows impressive thermal stability under   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   thermal treatment for   $30\\,\\textrm{min}$   (Figure S4, Supporting Information). After  cooling to room temperature, the PL intensity of heat-treated  sample showed only slight reduction compared with that of  the untreated sample. These give us the confidence to overcome the moisture and thermal stability problems that the  other known perovskite materials cannot.  \n\nNow, we applied PL and PLE spectra to investigate the light  emission mechanisms. In general, PL spectrum originated  from i ono luminescence is affected strongly by the excitation  energy because the excitation and the recombination rates  depend largely on ion energy levels and their resonance. For the i ono luminescence in   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$  ,   $^1{\\mathrm S}_{0}{}^{-1}{\\mathrm P}_{1}$   transition is allowed  and   ${}^{1}\\mathrm{S}_{0}–{}^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{1}$   transition is partially allowed by spin–orbit interaction. While   ${}^{1}\\mathrm{S}_{0}{-}^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{0}$   and   ${}^{1}\\mathrm{S}_{0}–{}^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{2}$   transitions are forbidden  at the electric dipole transition level, they can be induced by  lattice vibration.  Generally, the variation of excited energy  leads to the obvious peak positions shift and shape change  for the corresponding emission.  For our present at ive   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}{:}2.75\\%\\mathrm{Bi}$   phosphor, when the monitoring emission  wavelength was varied from 430 to   $490~\\mathrm{nm}$  , the corresponding  excitation spectrum shows negligible peak shift and shape  change ( Figure   4 a). Similarly, when the excited wavelength  was varied from 320 to   $380~\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 4b), the corresponding  emission spectrum shows negligible shift as well. Such wide  excitation plateaus indicate that the light emission mechanisms  should not be   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   i ono luminescence.  \n\nMore insight into the luminescence mechanism is obtained  from time-resolved PL measurements. Figure 4c shows the PL  decay curve of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6};2.75\\%$   Bi measured at   $455~\\mathrm{nm}$   excited  by   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$   light. The main part of the decay curve is fitted well  by an exponential function  \n\n$$\nI_{t}=I_{0}\\exp\\!\\left({-t/\\tau}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere   $I_{t}$   is the time variation of PL intensity at time  $t_{i}$  ,   $I_{0}$   is the  initial PL intensity, and   $\\tau$  is the decay time in the exponential  components. According to the PL decay curve,   $\\tau$  is estimated  to be 343 ns. This is much shorter than that of   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   emission reported in bismuth doped materials, such as   $4.68~\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   for   $\\mathrm{ScVO_{4}}$  :Bi and  $8.24\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   for  $\\mathrm{YVO_{4}}$  :Bi.  \n\nTemperature-dependent (83–323 K) PL spectra were further  obtained for our   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi phosphors, and the corresponding  pseudo color map is shown in Figure 4d. With increasing temperature from 83 to 323 K, the integrated PL intensity decreased  and the FWHM of PL peak broadened, being consistent with  a model that more phonons coupled to excitons which exacerbate non radiative recombination at higher temperatures.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/f2d32b97bbbcf8df0269c5a9b619e849c1eee51785ca2ca37f143d10e\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Output\n\n(NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
