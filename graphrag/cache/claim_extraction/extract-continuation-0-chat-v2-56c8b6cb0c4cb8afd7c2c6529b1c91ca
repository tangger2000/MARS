Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As shown in Figure 4b, the K–L plots are linear and parallel,  which manifest that the   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   kinetics on the catalyst of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$    is a first order dependence.  The electron transfer number  ( n ) of the   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   was calculated to be in the range of 1.14–1.17  from the slopes of the   $\\mathrm{K}{-}\\mathrm{L}$   plots in Figure 4b, indicating a  two-electron reduction reaction is dominant during the ORR  process for   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   in   $0.1~\\mathrm{~M~}$   KOH. In comparison, the K–L  plots of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}2$   are obtained at 0.76, 0.75, and   $0.74\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$    (vs RHE), as shown in Figure 4d, which are linear and parallel similarly. However, the electron transfer number of the   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$   was calculated to be in the range of 3.90–3.99,  indicating that the ORR process of   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   is nearly  four-electron pathway. These results imply that the decoration  of NiCo alloy nanoparticles on N-doped carbon fibers could  result in more active sites and easier transportation of oxygen  and electrolyte due to the special novel structure, which could  be corresponding to the SEM and TEM images well. Thus, the  ORR catalytic activity of the N-doped carbon fibers have been  enhanced significantly after decorated with NiCo alloy nanoparticles, which might also be attributed to the change of the  electron transfer pathway from 2e to 4e.  \n\nFrom the electrochemical investigations, we could see that  NiC  $\\mathrm{\\cdoto@N\\!\\cdot\\!C}$   2 owns the surprisingly, most outstanding catalytic activities for both the ORR and OER. The special bimetallic alloy uniformly decorated on the N-doped carbon fibers  might also be beneficial for the stability enhancement of the  carbon materials. On the other hand, the high conductivity of  the carbon fibers support could enhance the electron transfer  for the NiCo alloy nano particle, alleviate the aggregation of  the nanoparticles and accelerate the ions transport during  ORR and OER processes.
