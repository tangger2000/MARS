However, the specific claim or fact is not clearly stated.<|>The schematic device structure of the AIHP photodetector is shown in Figure 1a. Here, p-type polymer poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)amine] (PTAA) is used as the hole-transporting layer, small molecular [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and bath o cup roi ne (BCP) as electron transport and exciton blocking layers, respectively. $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{x}\\mathrm{Br}_{3-x}$ film is deposited via one-step spin-coating method. Although PTAA has been used as an efficient hole-transporting layer in previous reports using organic cation-contained per ovsk ites, we notice the surface wet t ability problem when we deposit AIHP precursor on it (Figure S1, Supporting Information). To improve the coverage and quality of the AIHP film on PTAA, an a mph i phil ic PEIE is introduced on the surface of PTAA, making the film wetting to the precursor solution. As shown in Figures S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information, the existence of PEIE significantly improves the film coverage of the CsP $\\mathrm{bIBr}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$ films but little difference on the phase and crystal lin it y is observed. The cross-section scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the devices shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information indicate the thicknesses of the $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$ films used in our devices are about 300 and $120\\;\\mathrm{~nm}$, respectively. The effect of the perovskite film thickness to the dark and photo current of the devices are studied by adjusting the precursor concentration. As shown in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information, the dark current of the devices decrease with precursor concentration (from $3.6\\times10^{-3}$ to $6.0\\times10^{-6}\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ at $-0.3\\mathrm{~V~}$) and the photocurrent of the devices increase with the precursor concentration (from 4.1 to $6.0\\:\\mathrm{mA}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ at  $0\\;\\mathrm{V}$) when the precursor concentration increase from 0.5 to $1.0\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$, mainly because a thicker film leads to less pin-holes and better absorption of incident light with increasing thickness (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The existence of the p- and n-type charge blocking layer and the high quality of the perovskite films significantly reduce the dark noise current of the obtained devices. As shown in Figure 1b,c, the dark currents of the $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    devices under  $-0.3\\mathrm{~V~}$   bias are around $6.0\\times10^{-6}\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and $4.8\\times10^{-5}$   mA   $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively. The values are much lower  than the MSM devices and comparable with previous reported  high performance photodetector s based on organic–inorganic  hybrid perovskite thin films and single crystals.  A lower  dark current indicates a lower shot noise and always along  with a lower thermal noise, which is one of the key factors to  achieve highly sensitive photodetector s.  We show the current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   curves of the devices under illuminations of a   $450~\\mathrm{nm}$   monochrome light with different intensities  in Figure 1b,c. We measure the photo currents of the devices of  about   $2\\times10^{-4}\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   under low light intensity   $(1~\\upmu\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  .  We observe excellent linear response property of our devices  to the light intensity when we increase the light intensity from  1 to   $10~1000~\\upmu\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and finally to  $1\\:\\mathrm{mW}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   by three orders  of magnitude.   $\\left(J\\propto\\,P^{n}\\right)$  , if   $n=1$  , its linear dependence of photocurrent on incident light power density, indicating high separation efficiency of photo generated carriers.)  \n\nThe photo resp on siv it y and the dark current noise are two  key factors that determine the device sensitivity. We show the  photo resp on siv it y spectra of devices based on AIHP and compare it with devices based on methyl ammonium lead iodide  perovskite   $\\left(\\operatorname{MAPbI}_{3}\\right)$  ) in Figure 1d. The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   device shows  resp on siv i ties from 0.21 to 0.28 A   $\\mathbb{W}^{-1}$   at the wavelength  range from 400 to   $580\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , which is comparable with that of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   device in the same wavelength range (Figure 1d). The  resp on siv i ties of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   device are 0.08 to 0.13 A   $\\mathbb{W}^{-1}$   at  the wavelength range of   $400{-}520\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . The photo resp on siv it y  spectra are corresponding to the absorption spectra of the  perovskite films (Figure S6, Supporting Information) indicating  the responses are from the perovskite films. Before measuring  the device noise with a lock-in amplifier, the noise floor of the  instrument is determined. As shown in Figure 1e, the noise of  the instrument is 180 to 2.3 fA   $\\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$   from 10 to   $700~\\mathrm{Hz}$  . The  measured noise currents of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   devices  are 567 to 7.7 fA   $\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$  , and 500 to 8.5 fA   $\\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$  , respectively,  which are obviously larger than the instrument noise floor,  indicating the measured noise is mainly from the devices.  Figure 1e also shows the thermal noise limit of the devices calculated from the dark deferential resistance based on the dark   $J{-}V$   curves shown in Figure 1b,c. The measured noises of the  devices are larger than the thermal noise limit at the measurement frequency range, which indicates that the measured noise  is dominated by   $1/\\mathrm{f}$   noise.

In addition, for the first time, we  successfully demonstrate the use of our photodetector s in an  optical communication system.  \n\nThe schematic device structure of the AIHP photodetector  is shown in  Figure   1 a. Here, p-type polymer poly[bis(4-phenyl)  (2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)amine]  (PTAA)  is  used  as  the  hole-transporting layer, small molecular [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric  acid methyl ester (PCBM) and bath o cup roi ne (BCP) as electron  transport and exciton blocking layers, respectively.   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{x}\\mathrm{Br}_{3-x}$  film is deposited via one-step spin-coating method.

The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   device shows  resp on siv i ties from 0.21 to 0.28 A   $\\mathbb{W}^{-1}$   at the wavelength  range from 400 to   $580\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , which is comparable with that of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   device in the same wavelength range (Figure 1d). The  resp on siv i ties of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   device are 0.08 to 0.13 A   $\\mathbb{W}^{-1}$   at  the wavelength range of   $400{-}520\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . The photo resp on siv it y  spectra are corresponding to the absorption spectra of the  perovskite films (Figure S6, Supporting Information) indicating  the responses are from the perovskite films. Before measuring  the device noise with a lock-in amplifier, the noise floor of the  instrument is determined. As shown in Figure 1e, the noise of  the instrument is 180 to 2.3 fA   $\\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$   from 10 to   $700~\\mathrm{Hz}$  . The  measured noise currents of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   devices  are 567 to 7.7 fA   $\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$  , and 500 to 8.5 fA   $\\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$  , respectively,  which are obviously larger than the instrument noise floor,  indicating the measured noise is mainly from the devices.  Figure 1e also shows the thermal noise limit of the devices calculated from the dark deferential resistance based on the dark   $J{-}V$   curves shown in Figure 1b,c. The measured noises of the  devices are larger than the thermal noise limit at the measurement frequency range, which indicates that the measured noise  is dominated by   $1/\\mathrm{f}$   noise. Based on the measured noise and  resp on siv it y, the noise equivalent power (NEP) of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/45d96b0abba2eb3fa1f072360d7b4f46951e733977769e1a331ad41c951c1de7-1723833486.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{x}\\mathsf{B r}_{3-x}.$   $(J-V)$   curves of  $\\mathsf{C s P b I B r}_{2}$  - and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$  -based photodetector s under dark and illumination of  $450\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   monochrome light with intensity of   $1~{\\upmu}{\\mathsf{m}}\\;{\\mathsf{c}}{\\mathsf{m}}^{-2}$   to   $\\mathsf{I}\\;\\dot{\\,})\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
