Importantly,  the peak EQE is high as   $2.6\\%$   (Figure 5d), which is one of the  best preformed perovskite-based LEDs in the deep-blue region  (Table  S2, Supporting Information). The average peak EQE  collected from a dozen of devices is about   $2.2\\%$  , as shown in  Figure  S15 (Supporting Information). The EL spectra at different driving voltages are listed in Figure 5e, where EL peaks  and FWHM were fixed at 465 and   $25\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   regardless of bias  voltage. Meanwhile, the EL emission delivered a coordinate of \n\n (0.14, 0.05), meeting the crucial blue NTSC standard of (0.14, \n\n 0.08) (Figure 5f). Moreover, chromatic it y of this deep-blue emission provide a wide color coverage (gamut), which achieves   $99.4\\%$   of the NTSC standard in the CIE 1931. Except EQE and  spectra stability, operational stability is also a tough challenge  for perovskite LED. In Figure  $5\\mathrm{g}.$  , we conducted time-dependent  EL trace under constant driven current of   $0.35~\\mathrm{\\mA}$      $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$    (current density at peak EQE), in which the EL spectra were  invariable. We recorded the corresponding evolution of luminance in Figure 5h, the   $\\mathrm{T}_{50}$   defined as time when luminance  declines to   $50\\%$   of initial value was   $13.5\\,\\mathrm{min}$  . In Figure  S16  (Supporting Information), the time dependent bias voltage was  also recorded. We suggest that excessive carriers injection and  ensuing non radiative recombination in perovskite active layer  (especially for blue ones) are severely detrimental to materials’  stability.  With aim at pursuing longer operational lifetime,  faster radiative recombination, better conductivity (lower joule  heat during electrical injection) and improved ionic stabilization in perovskite layer are expected to be achieved in the future  work.  \n\nThis work uncovers the factors responsible for nonideal  stability of low-dimensional domains in 2D perovskite films.  A newly tailored and promising spacer molecule with strong  bonding force with inorganic layers was used to pin the  domain distribution in quasi-2D perovskite film. This resulted  in stable deep-blue emission mainly from   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain. Furthermore, a mixed spacer system was set up to control la bly  modulate the domains’ population, by which   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   domain with  severely non radiative recombination and retarded exciton  transfer was dramatically suppressed, meanwhile, the population of   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain (emitting species) was enhanced without  by-product of higher  $n$   domains. Such an exceptional composition led to fast and complete exciton transfer. The optimized  2D perovskite film delivered ideally independent emission  from   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain (peak at   $465\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) with high PLQY of   $77\\%$  .  Finally, the fabricated LED exhibited stable deep-blue emission with fixed EL peak and FWHM. The CIE coordinate  (0.145, 0.052) totally matched the blue requirement of NTSC  standard. The obtained EQE is one of the highest results for  full-bromide PeLEDs with deep-blue emission. Our work provides a guide to design stable deep-blue quasi-2D perovskite  material with high PLQY for electroluminescence, which  may also have potential for the development of other kinds of  applications.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/253a719de7becccaee5413f30a54ff05c4805df1224b47a39ed0f9a60ee2efad-1723834750.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $J{-}V{-}L$   curves of the best-preformed LED.  d) Current efficiency and EQE versus voltage characteristics. e) EL spectra under various bias voltages (inset: photograph of a working device). f) The  CIE 1931 chromatic coordinates of our device. g) Time-dependent evolution of EL spectra at   $0.{\\bar{35}}\\,\\,{\\mathsf{m A}}\\,\\,{\\mathsf{c m}}^{-2}$   (peak EQE). h) Operational lifetime  measurement of the deep-blue LED under constant driven current density of   $0.35\\ \\mathsf{m A}\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  .  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials and Chemicals : CsBr,   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$  , DMSO (anhydrous,   $99.9\\%)$  ),  hydrobromic  acid  (HBr),  1,4-bis(amino methyl)benzene  (P-PDA),  p-phenyl ene dia mine, and per flu or in a ted ionomer (PFI, Nafion 117  solution) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PEABr were purchased  from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. 3TPYMB   $(99.9\\%)$   and Liq  were purchased from Luminescence Technology. All the materials were  directly used without further purification.  \n\n$P{\\cdot}P D A B r_{2}$   Synthesis : Organic amine was dissolved in deionized water  at   $5\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu g}\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}^{\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}$  . HBr was added into the solution at room temperature  and stirred for  $2\\ \\mathsf{h}$  . The mole ratio of HBr: organic amine was fixed at  2.2 to ensure full reaction. The solution was rotary evaporated at   $50~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  to obtain yellow precipitate. White powder was obtained by re dissolving  the yellow precipitate in water and washing with acetone three times.  Finally, the product was vacuum-dried at room temperature for  $24~\\mathsf{h}$  .  \n\nPrecursor Solution Preparation : The precursor solutions P1–P5 were  prepared by dissolving   $\\mathsf{P}\\!\\!-\\!\\mathsf{P D A B r}_{2}$  , CsBr, and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   in DMSO at different  molar ratios of 2: 1: 2, 4: 3: 5, 2: 2: 3, 2: 3: 4, and 2: 4: 5.   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   was  fixed at   $0.12~\\mathrm{~M~}$  . The ratio of pure   $\\mathsf{P{\\mathrm{.}P D A P b B r_{4}}}$   was 1: 1   $(\\mathsf{P}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{D A B r}_{2}/$   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2})$  ). The solution was then stirred for  $2\\,\\mathsf{h}$  .

Aging tests were conducted on the as-prepared  films. FTIR measurement were conducted by using absorption infrared  spectrometer (VERTX 70), here all samples were prepared by mixing  anisole solution and KBr powder. GIXRD spectra were obtained by X-ray  diffract o meter with a Cu   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  source (P ANalytical B.V. Empyrean).   $^1\\dot{\\mathsf{H}}$    NMR spectra were recorded on an Agilent DD2 400 MHz spectrometer,  where powdered samples were packed in   $4\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}$   zirconia MAS rotor  with Macor caps and spun by using boil-off nitrogen to acquire the  data, the rotor was placed into a  $5~\\mathsf{m m}$   outer diameter glass tube. The  cross-sectional samples were prepared by using\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
