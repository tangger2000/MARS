Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In the PL spectrum, an  emission peak at   $410\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   with an FWHM of   $48\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   can be  observed. The sample has a relatively small Stokes shift of   ${\\approx}15\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   (107 meV), implying that the PL emission of QDs originates from direct exciton recombination.  The fluorescence  peak of QDs showed a notable   $60~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   blueshift compared with  that of single crystal, suggestive of the strong quantum confinement effect. The excitation peak of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs is located at   $332\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   as demonstrated by the excitation spectrum (Figure S6,  Supporting Information).  \n\nThe absolute PLQYs of diluted QD solutions were determined using a fluorescence spectrometer with an integrated  sphere excited at a wavelength of   $330\\;\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . The PLQYs of   $10.2–19.4\\%$   were recorded for the QD samples from different  batches, which are higher than the all-inorganic Pb-based  QDs with similar emission peak wavelength   $(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{3}$   emitted  at   $410\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   with a PLQY   $10\\%$  ) and comparable with organic– inorganic layered lead perovskite   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{4}$   in the same wavelength region (about   $26\\%$  ). To verify the accuracy of PLQY  values, we also employed a relative fluorescent testing method  to measure the   $\\mathrm{PLQY},^{\\left[42\\right]}$   where quinine sulfate acid aqueous  solution served as the standard sample and determined the  PLQYs to be   $9.8{-}21.2\\%$   for the same set of samples, justifying  our PLQY results.  \n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs as well as the size distribution are presented in  Figure   3 a–c. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Figure 3b) reveals the lattice distances  of 3.42 and   $3.{\\dot{2}}8{\\mathrm{~\\AA~}}$   corresponding to the (200) and (003) crystal  planes, respectively. Our   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs have an average diameter of   $3.88~\\mathrm{nm}$   with a size deviation of   $\\pm0.67$   nm (Figure 3c),  which may explain the wide FWHM observed in the photoluminescence spectra. Figure 3d shows the X-ray diffraction  (XRD) patterns of as-synthesized QD powders (Figure S7,  Supporting Information), verifying the phase of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$  . The  peak located at   $25.8^{\\circ}$   is attributed to the (200) plane, and the  peak at   $27.2^{\\circ}$   corresponds to the (300) plane. In comparison  with the XRD pattern taken on the single crystal (Figure 1a), we  observed broadening of the diffraction peaks, which is caused  by the nanoscale size of colloidal QDs.  \n\nTemperature-dependent PL spectra were collected on the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs to investigate the origin of the shorter PL  lifetime and higher PL intensity of these QDs. As shown in  Figure   4 a, a pseudo color map of the temperature-dependent  PL spectra illustrates the evolution of PL emission with temperature from 200 to   $320\\;\\mathrm{~K~}$  . As shown in Figure S8 in the  Supporting Information, the PL intensity exhibited obvious  decrease with increasing temperature. Figure 4b shows the  integrated PL intensity versus temperature. On the basis of  the least-squares fit Equation (2), the exciton binding energy   $(E_{\\mathrm{b}})$   is estimated to be   $210.7~\\mathrm{meV}.$   Compared to the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$    single crystals, it is clear that the exciton binding energy in QDs  greatly increased. The large exciton binding energy suggests  that the PL emission of the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs mainly takes place  through exciton recombination rather than the recombination  of free electrons and holes due to the enhanced exciton stability.  Furthermore, as the size reduced to nanometer scale, each QD  is most likely defect free, and hence excitons are more prone  to recombine radiative ly. The above two reasons explained the  observed enhanced PLQY in our   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs.  \n\nTo further study the exciton recombination dynamics, timeresolved PL spectra were measured and shown in Figure 4c.  The PL decay curve can be fitted as a short-lived PL lifetime   $(\\tau_{1})$   of 1.61 ns with a percentage of   $82.6\\%$   and a long-lived PL  lifetime   $(\\tau_{2})$   of   $4.39~\\mathrm{ns}$   with a percentage of   $17.4\\%$  . Similar to   $\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   nano crystals, the short lifetime was attributed to  the exciton recombination while the long-lived component may  correlate to the surface defect recombination due to the stable  exciton. Therefore, the photo luminescence of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs  was mostly driven by the exciton radiative recombination and  limited by the presence of non radiative defects.  Further  pass iv ation of these harmful defects to achieve single-component PL decay kinetics should be pursued to improve the PLQY  of our   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs.  \n\nThis method can easily be extended to synthesize colloidal   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{X}_{9}$   QDs, where X represents mixed halide compositions,  through simply mixing of CsX and   $\\mathrm{BiX}_{3}$   salts in the precursors  (Figure S9, Supporting Information).
