The absorbance spectra of the samples were recorded with a Perkin  Elmer  Lambda  750  ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared  (UV/Vis/NIR)  spectrophotometer. The electrical conductivity was measured by the fourprobe van der Pauw technique (RTS-9). The steady-state PL spectra were  recorded with an FLS 920 spec tro flu oro meter (Edinburgh Instruments)  equipped with a continuous wavelength Xenon lamp (450 W).  The wavelength of excitation light was   $520\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n m}$  . The TRPL decay  spectra were measured using FLS 920 spec tro flu oro meter (Edinburgh  Instruments) equipped with an   $\\mathsf{n F900}$   ultrafast nanosecond flashlamp.  The excitation light illuminated the perovskite film surface at the same  angles for all PL measurements. UPS profiles were measured with a  monochromatic He I light source   $(21.22\\ {\\mathsf{e V}})$   and a VG Scienta R4000  analyzer. A sample bias of   $-5~\\lor$  was applied to observe the secondary  electron cutoff (SEC). The XPS spectra were measured by the Thermo  Fisher ESCALAB  $\\mathsf{X}\\mathsf{I}^{+}$   measurement instrument with an Al Ka X-ray source   $(]486.6\\ \\mathsf{e V})$  ). The current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   curves were measured  using a Keithley 2400 source meter under a calibrated AM 1.5G solar  simulator system   $(\\mathsf{I}00\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2})$  ). The EQE spectra were recorded by an  SRF50 system. The FTIR spectra were measured with a Bruker Tensor 27  spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Germany). Grazing-incidence wide-angle  X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was measured by HomeLab with Hypix-6000  detector (Rigaku). The incidence light angle was   $0.2^{\\circ}$  . The wavelength  of incident X-ray was   $0.154\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . The stability test at the continuous  maximum power point (MMP) tracking under 1 Sun illumination (xenon  lamp (450 W),   $100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\ c m^{-2}$  , AM 1.5G) for the un encapsulated device  was performed under ambient and inert atmosphere   $(\\mathsf{N}_{2})$   according to  the ISOS-L-1I protocol.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science  Foundation of China (No. 61974045), the Natural Science Foundation of  Guangdong Province (No. 2019 A 1515012092), and the State Key Lab of  Subtropical Building Science (No. 2021ZB19).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Data Availability Statement  \n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the  corresponding author upon reasonable request.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\nhydrogen bonds, ion migration,   $\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{C T}_{x}$   MXene, perovskite solar cells,  work function  \n\nReceived: December 30, 2021 Revised: March 1, 2022 Published online: March 11, 2022  \n\n[1]\t A.  Kojima, K.  Teshima, Y.  Shirai, T.  Miyasaka,  J.
