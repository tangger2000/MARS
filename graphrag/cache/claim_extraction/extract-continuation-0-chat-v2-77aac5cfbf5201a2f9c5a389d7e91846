As shown in Figure  2e and  Table S2 (Supporting Information), the per ovsk ites on   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2^{-}}}$  HP shows much shorter lifetimes (  $\\tau_{1}$   of 5.21 ns,   $\\tau_{2}$   of 40.76 ns)  than that on  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (  $\\tau_{1}$   of 7 .95 ns,   $\\tau_{2}$   of 100.86 ns), indicating more  efficient electron transfer to the ETL. Besides the enhanced  interface contact, we also anticipated that the improved lattice  matching between the stacked two layers is able to reduce the  residual strain at the ETL/perovskite interface and in the perovskite layer, which has been proven to play a dominant role for  obtaining highly efficient and stable PSCs.  \n\nTo further verify the advantages of regulated   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   as the  ETL for planar PSCs, devices with the architecture of   $\\mathrm{ITO}/$   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2.}$  /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au  were  fabricated.
