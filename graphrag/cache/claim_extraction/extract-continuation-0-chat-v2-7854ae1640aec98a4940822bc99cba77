Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As shown in Figure  S6b,e,h, in the Supporting Information,  cut-off binding energy   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{cut-off}}\\right)$   is 16.64, 16.70, and   $16.90\\,\\mathrm{~eV~}$    for of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}\\mathrm{{-}I L},}$   and perovskite, respectively. Fermi level \n\n  $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$   of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}\\mathrm{{-}I L}}$  , and perovskite are calculated to be \n\n  $-4.58$  ,   $-4.52$  , and  $-4.32~\\mathrm{eV};$  , respectively, by using the formula  of   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}=21.22-E_{\\mathrm{cut-off}}$   (Table S1, Supporting Information).   As illustrated in Figure  S6c,f,i, in the Supporting Information, Fermi edge   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F,edge}}\\right)$   is estimated to be   $3.91~\\mathrm{eV}$   for   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   film,   $3.90\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   for   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}\\mathrm{{IIL}}}$   film, and   $1.37~\\mathrm{eV}$  for perov- skite film. Based on the equation of   $E_{\\mathrm{VB}}\\,=\\,E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\,-\\,E_{\\mathrm{F,edge}},^{[23\\mathrm{a},34]}$  the   $E_{\\mathrm{VB}}$  ’s of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL and perovskite are calculated to  be   $-8.49$  ,   $-8.42$  , and  $-5.69\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  , respectively, which is listed in  Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Finally, the   $E_{\\mathrm{CB}}$  ’s of \n\n  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -IL, and perovskite are determined to be   $-4.34$  , \n\n  $-4.27$  , and   $-4.12~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively, according to the formula of   $E_{\\mathrm{CB}}\\,=\\,E_{\\mathrm{VB}}\\,+\\,E_{\\mathrm{g}}.$  . Figure 1h shows the energy level diagram of  device components in this study. Obviously, the   $E_{\\mathrm{CB}}~(-4.27~\\mathrm{eV})$    of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   is slightly upshifted after ImAcHCl modification and  is closer to that of perovskite   $(-4.12\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   compared with control   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$     $(-4.34\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}})$  , which is expected to be beneficial for  reducing interface energy barrier and thus suppressing interface recombination. Moreover, the dipole effect of ImAcHCl  molecule is confirmed by work function shift of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   from   $-4.58$   to  $-4.52\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   after modification.  \n\nFigure   2  illustrates UV–vis absorption spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  images of perovskite films deposited on   $\\mathrm{FTO}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   substrates  with and without ImAcHCl modification. The results show that  both UV–vis absorbance and XRD peak intensity is increased  after modification, which means that the introduction of  ImAcHCl can slightly improve the perovskite crystallization  and thereby contributes to a slight increase in current density.  Besides, highly crystalline perovskite films can be obtained for  both   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL films substrates as reflected by two very  strong main diffraction peaks in Figure  2b. Figure  S7 in the  Supporting Information shows the SEM images of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   films  treated by different concentrations of ImAcHCl. It is found that   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   seems to be covered more uniformly by ImAcHCl as the  concentration increases but not evident. Besides, a slightly  increased average perovskite grain size from 1.22 to   $1.34\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   is  consistent with slightly increased UV–vis absorption and XRD  peak intensity (Figure 2c,d). Furthermore, the cross section of  perovskite film with ImAcHCl modification seems to be slightly  better than that of control film as revealed in Figure 2e,f. We  have also checked the water wet t ability of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film before and  after ImAcHCl treatment. The wet t ability of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film becomes  better after ImAcHCl modification as illustrated in Figure  S8  in the Supporting Information, which is probably responsible  for the improved perovskite crystallization. In addition, the conductivity of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film is improved after ImAcHCl modification  (\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## NONE<|>NONE<|>MATERIAL PROPERTY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The text does not provide any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery for the specified entity types.<|>The text does not provide any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery for the specified entity types.\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
