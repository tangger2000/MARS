Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The detectable SHG response confirms  that the HTP has the non-centro symmetric space group  C 222.  It is worth noting that at around   $T_{\\mathsf{c}},$   abrupt decrease of the SHG  intensity is consistent with the feature of first-order transition  phase. We noticed the color change of 1 at different temperature and performed variable-temperature solid state UV–vis  absorption spectra of 1.

It is noted that this transition is completely reversible. Accordingly, the absorption edge is red-shifted, which is  consistent with the color change of the crystal of 1. Thermochromism has been reported in molecular ferroelectric s based  on   $\\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}$  , [DMe-DABCO  $\\mathsf{I C u C l_{4}}$  .  Optical gap band is   $2.03\\ \\mathrm{eV}$  by fitting the Tauc-equation at   $303\\;\\mathrm{~K},$  , and due to thermochromism, band gap decreases to   $1.93\\,\\mathrm{~eV~}$   at   $433\\;\\mathrm{~K~}$   (Inset of  Figure 4b).  This band gap is significantly lower than recently  those reported 2D lead halide perovskite ferroelectric s, such  as (benz yl ammonium)  $\\mathsf{\\Omega}_{2}\\mathsf{P b C l}_{4}$   (3.65  eV),    $[\\mathrm{2-FBA}]_{2}\\mathrm{PbCl_{4}}$   $(3.62\\ \\ \\mathrm{eV})_{}^{[10\\mathrm{g}]}$     $(\\mathrm{ATP})_{2}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{4}$   (3.62  eV),    $(\\mathrm{EA})_{2}(\\mathrm{MA})_{2}\\mathrm{Pb}_{3}\\mathrm{Br}_{10}$  (2.70eV),    $\\mathrm{(C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3})_{2}C s P b_{2}B r_{7}}$     $(2.70\\mathrm{eV})$  ,  and (4,4-difluoroc y clo hex yl ammonium  $\\phantom{}_{1}2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$   (2.38 eV).  \n\nThe first principles calculation was performed to reveal the  band structure and the partial density of states (PDOS). The  band structure indicates that indirect band gap of   $2.489\\,\\mathrm{~eV}$    exists between the lowest point of conduction band (A point)  and the highest point of the valence band (G point) (Figure S5,  Supporting Information). The difference in experimental and  theoretical band gaps, may be due to that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the Bi atom, is not considered. This situation  also occurs in similar compounds, such as   $(\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{9}N I)_{4}A g B i I_{8},}$  ,    $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{9}$  ,  and   $(\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{MDAP})\\mathrm{BiI}_{5}$  .  In addition, the PDOS  disclose that the valence band and conduction band origin  is derived from I-5p states, Bi-6p and Ag-4p, respectively  (Figure S6, Supporting Information).  \n\nWe further evaluated the feasibility of the crystal of 1 as direct  X-ray detector. The X-ray attenuation was determined from the  absorption spectra of the crystal over a broad range of photon  energies using the photon cross section database ( Figure   5 a).   It can be found that the X-ray attenuation of the crystal of 1 is  higher than that of mono crystalline silicon, and is close to the  level of CdTe in the energy range of   $0.01–100\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{MeV}.$   From the  absorption diagram (Figure S7, Supporting Information), it can  be observed that the crystal with a millimeter-thick can absorb  all the   $40\\ \\mathrm{keV}$   X-rays without penetrating them. This material  has a strong ability to block X-rays. This strong X-ray absorption is partially due to the large atomic number of the Bi element and the high average atomic number of the crystal. The  charge carrier mobility   $(\\mu)$  –charge carrier lifetime ( τ ) product,   $\\mu\\tau,$   was further evaluated based on modified Hecht equation.   The   $\\mu\\tau$  product and   $I_{0}$   (saturated photo current) were illustrated  in Figure S8, Supporting Information. The   $\\mu\\tau$   value was determined to be on the order of   $10^{-5}$  . The large attenuation coefficient for X-ray, large atomic number   $(Z)$  , and efficient  $\\mu\\tau$   enable  potential of 1 for X-ray detection.  \n\nWe then sought to determine X-ray response based on the 1  crystal. Since the inorganic layers are separated by the organic  layers, carriers tend to transport along with planar direction.   Meanwhile,   $P_{\\mathrm{{s}}}$   is also parallel to the planar layers. Therefore,  based on the preferential planar charge transport and surface  polarization of single crystal 1, planar structure was selected  as the detection method (Figure  5b, inset). For the sake of  experimental uniformity, we used the same crystal for all subsequent tests.
