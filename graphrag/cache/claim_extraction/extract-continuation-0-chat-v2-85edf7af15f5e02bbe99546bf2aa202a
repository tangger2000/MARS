Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The  WF values are close to those obtained from the UPS measurements, which suggests that the   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$  treatment can effectively  decrease the WF of the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets by replacing  the surface terminated  $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups with   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   groups.  \n\nThe WF of the semiconductor is defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level   $(E_{\\mathrm{vac}})$   and its Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$  .   The WF difference of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene caused by different surface terminated groups are analyzed according to the movement  of the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$  . As illustrated in  Figure   3 a, the surface terminated   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   groups with strong electron-donating ability will  increase the electron density of the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene by donating  electrons to the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{C}$  , which causes the   $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}$   to move upward. At  the same time, a surface dipole moment directed from Nb layer  (negative end) to the   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   groups (positive end) is generated,  and an electric field directed from the  $-\\mathrm{OH}$   groups to Nb layer  is formed, which will shift down the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$  . Consequently, the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene with   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   terminated surface groups exhibit  lower WF compared with the bare   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{C}_{1}$  , which is consistent  with the first-principles calculations.  For the surface terminated   $-\\mathrm{F}$  groups, the Nb layer transfer electrons to both the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups and the underneath C layer, resulting in a downshift of the  $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}$  . However, the underneath C layer gets more electrons than the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups, which results in a negative dipole  moment though the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups are negatively charged.  The  surface dipole moment directed from Nb layer (negative end)  to the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups (positive end) causes the downshift of the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$  . At this point, the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups have little effect on the WF of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene. Similar to the   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   groups, the surface terminated   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   groups with electron-donating ability upshift the   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene and the surface dipole moment directed  from Nb layer (negative end) to the   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   groups (positive end)  causes the downshift of the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}},$  , resulting in a decreased WF  compared with the bare   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{C}$  . The XPS and FITR measurements reveal that the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups are gradually replaced with  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/df0d1f44367049ecdec38b69ecbb94cb2e5fc0da56200ef445011a23121cbdff-1727104696.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   a) The schematic diagram of the Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$   and vacuum level   $(E_{\\mathrm{vac}})$   movement induced by different surface functional groups   $(-O H$  ,   $-\\mathsf{F},-\\mathsf{N H}_{2})$  ). b) The energy level diagram of the  $\\mathsf{P}\\!\\!-\\!\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{C T}_{x}$   MXene and   $\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{C T}_{x}$   MXene treated with   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}\\mathsf{H}_{4}$   at different times.

The increment of   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   groups will reduce the WF of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene,  as illustrated in Figure  3b.

The   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   treated   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene with decreased WF  is beneficial to transport photo-generated electrons from the  perovskite layer to the ITO electrode, thus improving the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  of the PVSCs. High transmittance is of great importance for  the ETL in n-i-p configuration PVSCs because it determines  the amount of light absorbed by the perovskite active layer.

The electrical conductivity of these   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene films is measured and the results are shown  in Table S1, Supporting Information. The electrical conductivity   $(\\delta)$   values of the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene and T ${\\mathrm{Nb}}_{2}{\\mathrm{CT}}_{x}$   MXene films  are   $3.43\\times10^{3}$   and   $4.78\\times10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{S\\m}^{-1}$  . The higher conductivity of   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene film may be attributed to the enhanced electron density aroused from the   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   groups, which is beneficial to improve the electron transport efficiency.  \n\nThe matched energy level alignment at the ETL/perovskite  interface is of vital importance for photo-generated electrons  transport from the perovskite layer to the ETL and finally collected by the electrode. The mechanism of charge transport process and band-bending at the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene/  $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  interface are further analyzed according to the Schottky–Mott  limit on the basis of the relative alignment of energy levels.
