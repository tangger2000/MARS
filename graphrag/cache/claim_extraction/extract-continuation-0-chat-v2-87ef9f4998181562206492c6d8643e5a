Introduction  \n\nEndured, low-cost, and high-performance flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  featuring lightweight and mechanical flexibility have attracted tremendous  attention for portable power source applications. However, flexible PSCs  typically use expensive and fragile indium–tin oxide as transparent anode  and high-vacuum processed noble metal as cathode, resulting in dramatic  performance degradation after continuous bending or thermal stress. Here,  all-carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs are fabricated employing graphene  as transparent anode and carbon nanotubes as cathode. All-carbon-electrodebased flexible devices with and without spiro-OMeTAD   $^{(2,2^{\\prime},7,7^{\\prime}}$  -tetrakis( N,N -di $\\cdot p$  -meth oxy phenyl amine)-9,9 ′ -spiro bif luo rene) hole conductor achieve  power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of   $11.9\\%$   and  $8.4\\%$  , respectively. The  flexible carbon-electrode-based solar cells demonstrate superior robustness  against mechanical deformation in comparison with their counterparts fabricated on flexible indium–tin oxide substrates. Moreover, all carbon-electrodebased flexible PSCs also show significantly enhanced stability compared to  the flexible devices with gold and silver cathodes under continuous light  soaking or  $\\mathbf{60\\,\\mathrm{\\textdegree}}$   thermal stress in air, retaining over  $\\mathbf{90\\%}$   of their original  PCEs after   $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{1000}}}\\,\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{h}}}$  . The promising durability and stability highlight that flexible  PSCs are fully compatible with carbon materials and pave the way toward the  realization of rollable and low-cost flexible perovskite photovoltaic devices.  \n\nSolution-processed metal halide perovskites are recognized as promising candidates of photo active materials because  of their extraordinary op to electronic and  unique physical properties such as tunable bandgap, strong absorption coefficient, and long carrier diffusion length.   These  intriguing  characteristics  have  allowed for a rapid progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction  perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which has  been substantially boosted from   $3.8\\%$   to  over   $22\\%$   due to the continuous efforts  on perovskite absorbers, film morphologies, and selective charge contacts.   One attractive advantage of perovskite  materials over the conventional silicon  for device fabrication is their low-temperature process capability, which opens  the opportunity for the device fabrication on various flexible substrates using  low-cost film deposition techniques such  as slot-die coating and ink printing.  \n\nDr. Q.

Despite the success in obtaining high  device efficiencies, the practical application of flexible PSCs  is still plagued with several realistic challenges.  In highperformance flexible PSCs, indium–tin oxide/polyethylene  naphtha late (ITO/PEN) is the popularly used transparent electrode.  Unfortunately, the scarcity of indium could hinder  the advantage of the rapid energy payback of per ovsk ites. Moreover, the poor mechanical robustness of ITO resulted  in dramatic performance degradation of flexible PSCs after  repeated bending.  For example, Jung and co-workers have  reported an ITO/PEN-based flexible PSC with an initial PCE of   $12.2\\%$  , while only  $50\\%$   of PCE was maintained after 1000 cycles  with a bending radius of   $4\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}$  .  Recently, Ag-mesh/conducting polymer composites have been successfully developed  to replace ITO/PEN transparent electrodes for flexible PSCs  with enhanced device robustness against mechanical deformation.  However, the Ag-mesh/conducting polymer-based  flexible PSCs underwent an obvious performance degradation  when subjected to thermal stress, decreased by   ${\\approx}25\\%$   after   $500\\,\\mathrm{h}$   at  $45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and  ${\\approx}77\\%$   after   $97\\,\\mathrm{h}$   at   $70\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , respectively.  \n\nOn the other hand, flexible PSCs generally use high-vacuumprocessed metals, such as gold and silver, as the preferred back  contacts.  The high price as well as the energy requirements associated with their high vacuum deposition challenges  the commercialization of flexible PSCs.  In particular, the use  of metal electrode limits the long-term stability of PSCs. It was  reported recently that the diffusion of metals across the hole  transport material (HTM) into the perovskite layer at elevated  temperatures caused a dramatic device performance loss. This situation is even much worse in inverted PSCs.  The  metal–electrode-induced performance degradation must be  overcome before PSCs can be considered as real products.  Although spatially separating the perovskite layer and metal  cathode could alleviate the metal–electrode-induced performance degradation to some extent,  fundamental solution  to the cost and stability issues associated with metal cathode in  PSCs still relies on developing alternative low-cost and stable  back contact materials.  \n\nCarbon nano materials have shown many advantages over  conventional metal oxide transparent electrodes used in solar  cells in terms of transparency, cost, stability, and mechanical  flexibility.  Attempts have been made to apply carbon materials as transparent electrodes in PSCs.  Very recently, Choi  and co-worker applied chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown  single-layer graphene as transparent electrodes in flexible PSCs  and obtained a PCE of   $16.8\\%$   with superior bending durability,  illustrating the advantages of graphene transparent  electrodes. In addition, carbon nano materials, such as carbon  black/graphite composites, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and  graphite, have also been proven to be competitive alternatives  to metals as back electrodes in rigid PSCs.  Compared with  other carbon allotropes, CNTs are of special interest for the  industry because of their high conductivity, excellent mechanical durability, as well as scalable manufacturing capability.  However, integrating CNTs into PSCs with high film quality  and conductivity is quite challenging because the fabrication  of CNT films from raw CNT powders with aggregated bundles  commonly needs the dispersant-aid dispersion and complex  film deposition and post-treatment.  We have previously  designed an advanced and low-cost technique to fabricate freestanding cross-stacking CNT (CSCNT) films from super aligned  CNTs array.  The combination al conductivity and mechanical flexibility of CSCNTs will be an important milestone in the  development of low-cost and flexible PSCs.  \n\nConsidering the attractive features of graphene and CSCNTs,  it is promising to simultaneously integrate them into PSCs  to create all carbon electrode-based flexible devices. Herein  we fabricated, for the first time, a type of all-carbon-electrode flexible PSCs, in which graphene and CSCNTs served  as front transparent electrode and back electrode, respectively.
