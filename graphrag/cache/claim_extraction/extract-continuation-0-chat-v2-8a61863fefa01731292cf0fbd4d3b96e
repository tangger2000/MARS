Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In contrast, the internal photon-to-current efficiency spectrums for  the best   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device (Figure  5d) suggested that the  incorporation of OTG3 had little influence on the charge extraction efficiency of the PSCs. The integrated current density was  calculated to be   $15.87\\ \\mathrm{mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , in good agreement with the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   obtained from the   $J{-}V$  characterization. To investigate the  charge carrier dynamics in perovskite solar cells, we carried  out a transient photo voltage (TPV) analysis to characterize the  charge recombination lifetime in the PSCs (Figure  5e). The  fact that the rate of decay of the TPV was substantially slower  in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device (  $(\\tau=9.64~\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$  ) than in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   $(\\tau\\!=\\!5.93\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$   further explains the reduced charge recombination  and improvement of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   in the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG3\\PSCs}$  .  \n\nIn addition to its higher photovoltaic performance, the PSCs  based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   also exhibited better stability than those  based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   when kept in a dark cabinet with the relative  humidity (RH) less than   $10\\%$   at room temperature (Figure 5f).  The device based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   without any encapsulation still retained about   $85\\%$   of its initial PCE after being aged  for 30 days. Nevertheless, the PCE of the CsPbI 3 -based device  dropped rapidly, the device degraded completely after 3 weeks of  storage with the perovskite layer slowly changed to light yellow.  Besides, further experiment is conducted to reveal the device stability in a high-humidity condition. As illustrated in Figure S16  (Supporting Information), the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device also exhibits  a small PCE loss of   $16\\%$   after aging for 7 days in   $35–40\\%$   RH,  but the control one degraded in just 1 day. In addition, the device  based on CsPbI –OTG3 maintained   $88\\%$   of its initial PCE after  3  \n\n$200\\textrm{h}$   of exposure to light in dry air and was therefore much  more stable than the device based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   without an OTG  capping layer (Figure S17, Supporting Information).  \n\nIn summary, we first proposed a strategy to stabilize the black  phase of all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite that involved systematically controlling the distortion of the corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{[PbI_{6}]^{4-}}$    framework via a large steric effect associated with organic terminal groups. Theoretical calculations and experimental studies  demonstrated that the steric hindrance due to the organic  terminal groups could maintain the linearity of the   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}I{-}P b}$    bonds and thus suppress the octahedral tilting of adjacent   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   units in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$  . The phase transition resistance against  moisture or polar solvents was thereby significantly increased.  Moreover, organic terminal groups could also passivate the  surface electronic trap states via efficient coordination between  carboxyl ate moieties and under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   defects. The  result was an extension of the carrier recombination lifetime of  the perovskite absorber. By the modification of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite layer with OTG molecules, we achieved a stabilized PCE  of   $13.2\\%$   for the inverted planar PSCs, which is the highest  efficiency obtained by the all-inorganic PSCs with an inverted  structure. In addition, the stability of the optimized device in  an ambient environment was excellent and superior to that of  the pristine device. We believe that this work also provides new  insight into the phase-stabilizing mechanism of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite that will lead toward highly efficient and stable perovskite  solar cells. Further study should be done to investigate the  impact of organic terminal groups on the stability and photovoltaic performance of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells based  on other types of absorbers such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$  .  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The FTO-coated glasses were etched with zinc  powder and   $\\mathsf{I}_{\\mathsf{\\Delta\\mathrm{~M~}}}\\mathsf{H C I}$   to obtain patterned substrates.
