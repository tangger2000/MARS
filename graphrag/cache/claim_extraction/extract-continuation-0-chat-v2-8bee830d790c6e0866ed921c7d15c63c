Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Mechanical  test indicated that this fiber shaped PD was bendable (see  Figure  4f) and held considerable robustness as its optoelectronic properties remained stable after 200 bending cycles. Similar to the Ti wire based PD, a self-powered PD was successfully  fabricated using   $\\mathrm{Zn}$   wire as the substrate as well as one electrode while  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires were synthesized as the photo active  material.  \n\nApart from the single-twisting fiber device, both fiber electrodes can be incorporated with photo active materials and  twisted together for a dual-wavelength PD. For example, Sun  et  al. presented a double-twisted broadband perovskite PD  based on fiber substrates.  A carbon fiber sequentially coated  with a   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   and a perovskite layer was then twisted with airannealed Cu wire whose surface was covered with   $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   and   $\\mathrm{CuO}$  , as shown in Figure  4b. The double-twisted PD showed  a high deform ability (Figure   $4\\mathrm{g})$  ) while the facile but welldesigned fabrication process makes the effective charge separation and collection possible.  \n\nOther than the twisting structure, coaxial structure is also  typically employed in designing fiber-shaped devices. Using  Kevlar fiber as the substrate, a self-powered coaxial fibershaped UV PD was synthesized by Zhang et al.  A Cr layer  was deposited on the surface of the fiber as one electrode and   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires were grown on it as the active material. PDMS,  which was coated on the bottom part for the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires,  was used to improve the mechanical performance of the device.  Finally, a Pd layer was sputtered on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowires as the other  electrode. The as synthesized PD (Figure 4c) showed high stability in bending, twisting and durability test. Other attempts  have used polymer (specifically polycarbonate) fibers for support and protection, while miniature semiconductor devices and  metallic wires were embedded into the polymer fiber substrate  by a thermally drawing process, as shown in Figure 4e.  This  device could still function normally after being washed by a  household washing machine, exhibiting an excellent robustness and bend ability.  \n\nWithout any complex structure, single carbon fiber based  PD was synthesized via doping and silver coating as shown in  Figure 4d.  The as fabricated PD exhibited no signal decaying  even with a bending curvature of   $100\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   (see Figure 4h).  \n\nFiber-based PDs generally exhibit show excellent op to electronic  performances due to their compact structures and the ability to  absorb light from   $360^{\\circ}$  . Fiber-based PDs also show an advantage  for the future integration with other applications. For example,  fibrous PDs could be woven with textiles even though the choice  of suitable fiber substrate is currently limited to metals.  \n\n# 2.4. Other Substrates  \n\nApart from polymer, paper, and fiber, there are some other  materials used as substrates for wearable PDs such as silicon,  mica,  etc.  \n\nSilicon substrate based PD was turned to “soft” from “hard”  by reducing the thickness of silicon.  Etching the silicon  layer to   $30~\\ensuremath{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   dramatically enhances the bend ability of the  substrate compared with the one with larger thickness. Based  on such soft silicon layer, active materials, and metal electrodes  were sequentially deposited to form a PD with a decent bendability, as shown in  Figure   5 a,e.  \n\nNi textile was also employed as the substrate to form a highly  bendable PD as shown in Figure  5b.    $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanowire arrays  were grown on Ni textile by a hydrothermal synthesis. Ag nanowires were dispersed on part of the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanowire arrays to facilitate electron–hole separation. Then the poly(methyl meth a cry late)  (PMMA)-supported graphene film was assembled on the surface  of Ag nanowires as one electrode while the Ni textile acted as the  other. The as fabricated PDs exhibited no current degeneration  under   $120^{\\circ}$   bending (see Figure 5f), showing a decent wear ability.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/981afd43125c24bdac577d8e1babd8de01cfcc4b98fbb8fc8ea2e6af671d8262-1727123090.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $30\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   thick silicon substrate.

The mixture of graphene oxide  nanosheets and zinc acetate solution was coated on the mica  substrate and femtosecond laser direct writing was conducted  to reduce graphene oxide and synthesize   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , which served  as the photo active material. This device was able to maintain  a stable performance under   $180^{\\circ}$   bending angle as shown in  Figure 5g. Besides, the morphology of active materials can be  controlled by adjusting the writing speed, which offered a convenient way for property control. Another mica substrate based  PD using 2D   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{Se}_{3}$   crystal arrays as photo active material,  metals as electrodes and PET as packaging material showed a  decent bend ability and a commendable op to electronic performance, as shown in Figure 5h. In this work, lamination process was adopted to combine materials together as shown in  Figure 5d.  \n\nIn the architecture of wearable PDs, the intrinsic flexibility  of materials, including substrates, photo active materials, and  electrodes is fully utilized. Moreover, mechanical designs to  the substrate such as pre stretching and origami have been  widely adopted to increase the deform ability as well as the light  absorption of the device.  \n\nPolymer, paper, and fiber are the three most commonly  adopted substrate materials. Polymer and paper share some  similarities on fundamental design principles for both of them  show a certain degree of flexibility and are suitable for largescale fabrication. However, there is a better adhesion between  paper and materials thanks to the porous structure of paper.  Moreover, the higher bend ability of paper makes spatial designs  such as origami possible, which turns 2D structures into 3D  configurations. Fiber substrate based PDs, apart from being  breathable, can also absorb light from   $360^{\\circ}$   and can be woven  with textiles\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Output\n\n(NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The text provided does not contain any claims or facts that are relevant to the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event) or the claim description.
