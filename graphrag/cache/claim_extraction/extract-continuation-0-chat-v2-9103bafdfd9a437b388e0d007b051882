The calculated over potentials as  a function of the free energy of the rate-determining step are  shown in Figure  5b.

Conclusion  \n\nA series of new single-phased high entropy perovskite nanoparticle oxides have been synthesized using a precipitation  method followed by post annealing. A total of five different  metals, including Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni are in the B-site lattices to make the per ovsk ites become high entropy materials.  Both equimolar and non-equimolar high entropy nanoparticles  were obtained and studied for their OER electro catalytic performances. We first show that the HEPOs outperform the single  perovskite oxides. The activity contribution of each metal in the  B-site lattices was then investigated by doubling its concentration. Doubling the Co was shown to be most effective, giving  an excellent over potential of   $325\\,\\mathrm{\\mV}$   at   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  , a low  Tafel slope of   $51.2~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1}$  , and excellent durability for   $50\\textrm{h}$  .  This study also opens a window of synthesizing advanced high  entropy materials for various potential applications.  \n\n# 4.

Sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH,  ${\\tt\\ge}98\\%$  ) and  $\\mathsf{R u O}_{2}$     $(99.9\\%)$  \n\nwere purchased from Alfa Aesar. Lemon juice (LJ) having a   $\\mathsf{p H}$   value of 3  was extracted from natural lemon.  \n\nLanthanum nitrate hex a hydrate and metal sulfate hydrates of Mn,  Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni were used as the precursors. In a typical process,  2 mmol of   $\\mathsf{L a}(\\mathsf{N O}_{3})_{3}{\\cdot}6\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$   was dissolved in   $20~\\mathsf{m}$   de-ionized (DI) water.  Transition metal sulfates having desired elements and concentrations  (2 mmol in total) were dissolved in  $20~\\mathrm{m}$   DI water. The two precursor  solutions were mixing in a beaker with the addition of citric acid   $(3.5~\\mathsf{m L}$    lemon juice) under stirring for   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . After that,   $20\\ \\mathsf{m l\\ 0.6\\M\\ N a O H}$    was also added into the resulting solution under stirring. The stirring  lasted for   $3\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$   to allow the formation of precipitates. The resulting  precipitates were centrifuged and washed using DI water and ethanol  several times, and then dried for   $24~\\mathsf{h}$   at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   in a vacuum oven. The  collected powders were milled and heat-treated in   $750~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\mathsf{T}2\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathsf{h}$  . The  sample having equimolar transition metal sulfates is designated as  L5M. The concentration of each transition metal sulfate was doubled  to obtain samples L5M2Ni, L5M2Co, L5M2Fe, L5M2Mn, and L5M2Cr,  where 2 M  (  $\\mathsf\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
