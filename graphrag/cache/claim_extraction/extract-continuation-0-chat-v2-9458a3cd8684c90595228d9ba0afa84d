Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Our previous study proved that by substituting the hydrogen (H) of the  benzene ring with fluorine (F), the free energy of the perovskite  surface was significantly reduced, endowing the perovskite with  superior stability against moisture in ambient air.  The perovskite layer   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.05}\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.10}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{0.97}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.03})_{3}$   with   $5\\%$   excess of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   was fabricated using anti solvent method  and annealed  at   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $20~\\mathrm{min}$   before applying the modulators. The passivation agent, PEAI and tBBAI were applied by spin coating on  the perovskite surface with   $15\\times10^{-3}$    m  solution in iso prop an ol  without further annealing ( Figure   1 B). The surface morphology  of the PEAI and tBBAI-passivated perovskite films is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the results are  shown in Figure 1C–E. For the untreated neat perovskite film, it is  observed that the domain size of the perovskite crystals is around   $500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  . After pas siva ting with PEAI and tBBAI, their appearance  remains unchanged, implying that the surface pass iv ation does  not alter the morphology of the perovskite active layer.  \n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to characterize the surface elemental properties of the passivated  perovskite, and the results are summarized in  Figure    2 A–C.  The C 1s spectra of all perovskite film surfaces are compared  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/042c858fc8d4a1d891958dc77f80dacecd6674288d2d4daf94f413a7df7b79cc-1723835226.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   A) Chemical structures of PEAI and tBBAI.

D) XRD patterns of neat perovskite, perovskite/PEAI, and perovskite/tBBAI  films.  \n\nin Figure  2B. In the neat perovskite film, a   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   peak at   ${\\approx}288\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   is observed, which is related to the oxygen and water  exposure of the surface of the perovskite film.  This peak is  significantly suppressed in the XPS spectra of the passivated  perovskite film, proving that surface pass iv ation with PEAI and  tBBAI can effectively protect the perovskite from oxygen and  moisture in ambient air.  A further XPS depth profiling for  tBBAI-passivated perovskite was carried out to reveal the out-ofplane direction elemental distribution as shown in Figure 2C.  Compared to the spectra of the neat perovskite film (Figure S1,  Supporting Information), the I 3d signal gradient of perovskite/ tBBAI starts at deeper part in the film, suggesting the tBBAI  layer thickness of  ${<}5~\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nThe structure of the un pas siva ted and passivated perovskite  film is characterized by XRD. As shown in Figure S2 in the  Supporting Information. The detailed XRD for   $2\\theta\\:<\\:20^{\\circ}$   is  shown in Figure 2D. Similar to a previous report,  nonpassivated perovskite film shows excessive amount of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   at  ${\\approx}12.8^{\\circ}$  For the PEAI-passivated perovskite film, diffraction peaks corresponding to PEAI at   $2\\theta=4.3^{\\circ}$  ,   $8.6^{\\circ}$  , and   $12.9^{\\circ}$   are observed,  implying crystalline PEAI on the surface of the perovskite film.  The XRD spectrum of the tBBAI-passivated perovskite film  exhibits no extra diffraction peaks, which suggests an amorphous morphology of the pass iv ation layer. We attribute this  result to an increased steric hindrance due to the  tert -butyl substitution of tBBAI as compared to PEAI.  \n\nWe investigated the op to electronic quality of the perovskite film by TRPL and steady-state absolute intensity  photo luminescence (AIPL). TRPL measurements on samples  with the structure glass/FTO/mp $\\cdot\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3,}$  /perovskite/interface  layer/ without and with HTL (spiro-OMeTAD) are shown  in  Figure    3 . For the samples without HTL (Figure  3A), at   $t>200$    ns after the excitation pulse the TRPL curves can be  well fitted with a (mono-) exponential function with the decay  times shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. We  observe a significant difference between the surface treatment  with the two modulators: The decay time for the PEAI-treated  perovskite film is a factor of three and for tBBAI a factor of five  higher than for the non pas siva ted film. We apply numerical  simulations to model the TRPL measurements at times beyond  200  ns. The details of these simulations are described in the  Supporting Information (Note S1). Since the only difference  between the samples is the surface layers, we fitted the numerical model to the data with only one free parameter, the surface recombination velocity  S . For the sample with the longest  decay time (tBBAI, black dots in Figure 3A), the decay could be  caused not only by  S  but also by non radiative bulk recombinations (with mono molecular recombination rate constant  $k_{1}$  , see  Note in the Supporting Information) or radiative bimolecular  recombination s (with bimolecular recombination rate constant   $k_{2})$  . Therefore, three extreme cases are considered, where the  PL decay at later times for tBBAI is caused exclusively by nonradiative (bulk) recombination s   $(k_{1}=k_{1}^{\\mathrm{max}}\\mathrm{~,~}k_{2}=0,S=0)$  ), by bimolecular radiative (bulk) recombination s   $(k_{2}=k_{2}^{\\mathrm{max}}\\,,k_{1}=0,S=0)$  ),  and by surface recombination s   $(k_{1}\\,=\\,k_{2}\\,=\\,0)$  ). The  S -fits for  all these cases are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/37f5beb4853bea6771d9e39b9e4d3d9a5037e05aa5dfcba0b18f140629482a59-1723835229.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   A) TRPL for the layer structure glass/FTO/mp  $\\mathsf{A l}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}/$  /perovskite/without surface layer (control, blue), with PEAI (red), and tBBAI (black).
