Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Experimental Section  \n\nPreparation of Cesium Oleate Stock Solution : A stock solution of cesium  oleate (Cs(oleate)) was prepared following the reported procedure by  Kovalenko and co-workers.  Briefly,   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$     $(^{130}\\mathrm{\\:m g)}$  , ODE   $(6.0~\\mathsf{m L})$  ,  and oleic acid   $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mum})$   were loaded into a   $25~\\mathsf{m L}$   three-neck round  bottom flask and dried under vacuum at   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\sf{\\Delta}\\sf{\\Delta}\\sf{\\sf h}$  . The mixture  was then heated under argon gas to   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   until all  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   reacted with  OA. The Cs(oleate) solution was stored at room temperature and was  preheated to  $\\mathsf{T}40~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   just before use in NC synthesis.  \n\nSynthesis and Purification of   $C s P b B r_{3}$   Nano crystals (NCs) :   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$     $(72\\ \\mathsf{m g},\\,0.2\\ \\mathsf{m m o l})$  ), ODE   $(5.0~\\mathsf{m L})$  ), OAm   $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mum})$  ), and OA   $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\:mL})$    were loaded into a   $25~{\\mathsf{m L}}$  three-neck flask and heated to   $105~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  under  vacuum for 30 min. The temperature was increased to   $170\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  and  Cs(oleate)   $(0.45~\\mathrm{mL})$   was swiftly injected. The reaction mixture turned  yellow and the reaction was then quenched by immersion of the flask  into an ice-water bath   $({\\approx}5~s$   after injection). Then,   $3\\,\\mathrm{\\Delta}m\\mathrm{L}$   hexane was  added to the as-prepared crude solution (total  $6~{\\mathsf{m L}}$  ). The solution was  centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min to remove aggregates and excessively  large NCs. The precipitate was discard and the NCs in super nat ant were  precipitated with acetone, then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The  obtained precipitated NCs were re-dispersed in toluene for further use.  \n\nSynthesis of   $C s P b B r_{3}/T i O_{x}$   Composite, and   $C s P b B r_{3}/T i O_{2}$  Core/Shell NCs :  In a typical reaction,   $20~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   TBOT dissolved in   $1\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$   toluene was added  dropwise into a   $\\mathsf{I5~m L}$   wide-mouthed mason jar containing   $\\mathsf{10~m L}$   of the  colloidal   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   NC toluene solution   $(\\approx].0\\;\\mathsf{m g\\;m L^{-1}})$  ) while stirring. The  solution was then stirred in a glove bag at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   and relative humidity  (RH) of   $30\\%$   for hydrolysis. After stirring for   $3\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$  , the precipitate was  collected through cent ri fuga tion at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and dried under  vacuum for   $\\texttt{!h}$   to obtain   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{x}$  composite. Subsequently, the  precipitate was dried at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   under vacuum overnight, and then calcined  under argon flow at   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $5~\\mathsf{h}$   to remove excess water and organic  matter to obtain   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   core/shell NCs. For TEM measurements,  the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   core/shell NCs were grinded in an agate mortar and  then dispersing in toluene under ultrasound for   $30\\;\\mathsf{m i n}$  .  \n\nAnion Exchange Reactions :  \n\n(a)\t Preparation of Anion Stock Solutions :   $\\mathsf{P b X}_{2}$   (0.2 mmol   $\\mathsf{X}=\\mathsf{C}\\vert$   or I), OA   $(0.5~\\mathsf{m L})$  , OAm   $(0.5~\\mathsf{m L})$  , and ODE   $(5~{\\mathsf{m L}})$   were loaded into a  $25~{\\mathsf{m L}}$  three-neck flask and heated to   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   under vacuum for   $30\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$  . The   $\\mathsf{P b X}_{2}$   solution was stored at room temperature. Note: additional  $\\mathsf{I}~\\mathsf{m L}$  of trio c tyl phosphine (TOP) is required to solubilize   $\\mathsf{P b C l}_{2}$  .  \n\n(b)\t Anion Exchange Test for   $C s P b B r_{3}/T i O_{2}$    Core/Shell NCs :   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  core/shell NCs   $.40~\\mathrm{mg})$  ) were dispersed in   $5.0~\\mathsf{m L}$   hexane at room  temperature.   $\\mathsf{P b X}_{2}$   stock solution was added into the NC solution under vigorous stirring. The nano crystals were separated out with different reaction times using cent ri fuga tion and followed by drying under  vacuum for PL measurements.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nW.Z. acknowledges support from a start-up grant of Syracuse University.
