Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

We also confirm the improvement in PCE is due  to molecular pass iv ation at GBs rather than at the   $\\mathrm{\\small{MA}\\mathrm{bl}_{3}/}$  HTL interface, which is evidenced by the fact that device performance shows negligible change when introducing thin  molecule layer on top of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   film. These results imply  that GB pass iv ation is critical to the observed performance  enhancement. Noteworthy, ITIC and DR3T passivated devices  significantly outperform PCBM and DTS, which are highly  consistent with the conclusions from the observations of optoelectronic measurements.  \n\nNot surprisingly, molecular pass iv ation at GBs via the dripping strategy is far more effective at achieving the desired outcome than mixing the molecules into the perovskite ink,  as  confirmed by poor surface coverage and low device performance   $(6.5{-}11.7\\%$   PCE) for the solution mixture strategy as shown in  Figure S12 and Table S6 (Supporting Information). The poor film  quality is likely due to nucleation and crystallization of perovskite  precursors and molecular aggregation in solution prior to solution-casting, as indicated by the darker color of the solution.  \n\nThe influences of molecular concentration were also  explored. Less molecular concentration will cause insufficient  pass iv ation, whereas high concentration leads to strong phase  aggregation (Figure S13, Supporting Information), increasing   $R_{s}$   as well as deteriorating  FF ,  ${\\cal J}_{\\mathrm{sc}},$   and hysteresis effect (Table S5  and Figure S13, Supporting Information) due to increased surface roughness and decreased inter connectivity for charge  extraction.  Shifting the dripping time earlier or later also  yields decline of device performance (Figure S14 and Table S7,  Supporting Information), while still higher than the control  ones fabricated at the same dripping time. This suggests a key  factor of controlling film formation kinetics, and highlights  importance of GB pass iv ation within perovskite film.  \n\nThe retarded film degradation in the presence of molecular  pass iv ation at GBs was further confirmed. The long-term stability of the perovskite films exposed to ambient air was first  evaluated. The perovskite films were exposed under ambient  environment with   $50\\%$   humidity in the dark without encapsulation for a   $60\\textup{d}$   period. The color already fades from black to  yellow for the control film while remains persistent for the molecules passivated perovskite films ( Figure   5 a). This suggests  that the molecules at the GBs suppress the attack of moisture  to perovskite films, due to strong hydrophobic it y of passivated  films as supported by the contact-angle analysis (Figure 5b).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/b3627c5d6da35dbf8f3ba5c54de3e013d83344a862b11ce969df13758017253f-1723833037.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $50\\%$   relative humidity. b) The contact angles of water on different perovskite films.  c) XRD patterns of all films before and after aging to ambient   $50\\%$   relative humidity. Note that   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   crystalline signals (red marked) can be observed  only in the aged control film. d) Recorded environmental stability of the corresponding perovskite solar cells exposed under ambient environment with   $50\\%$   humidity in the dark at room temperature without encapsulation. e) Recorded thermal stability of the corresponding perovskite solar cells under  heating stress   $(80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C})$   under inert atmosphere.  \n\nThe greatly enhanced stability against degradation in humid  air is also likely due to hydrogen bonding interaction between  the amorphous MA and molecules. The well-maintained crystal  structure in the passivated films is also confirmed by XRD patterns,  which indicate well-defined perovskite diffraction s  peaks without observable   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   signals in the passivated films  (Figure 5c).  \n\nThe environmental stability of the corresponding solar cells  was further evaluated. The bare devices without encapsulation  were exposed under ambient environment with   $50\\%$   humidity  in the dark at room temperature. The devices performance was  recorded periodically. Figure 5d shows the normalized PCEs  against time and Table S8 (Supporting Information) shows the  recorded device parameters. As expected, the passivated devices  exhibit significantly improved environmental stability in contrast to the control one. For example, the PCE degrades to   $64\\%$  after   $40\\textup{d}$   while maintaining   $76\\%$  ,   $86\\%$  ,   $82\\%$  , and   $87\\%$   of its  initial value for the PCBM, ITIC, DTS, and DR3T passivated  devices. Note that the ITIC, DTS, and DR3T passivated devices  exhibit better stability in contrast to the PCBM-containing one,  which might be attributed to the formation of Lewis acid–base  adducts, hydrogen bonding interactions and more hydrophobic  surface, which render much stronger resistance to degradation  over a much longer time period than the PCBM-based device.  \n\nAs expected, the passivated devices also exhibit drastically  improved thermal stability. The PCE of the devices under  heating stress (  $.80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for  $24\\,\\mathrm{{h}}$  ) in inert environment without any  encapsulation shows a minimum loss by  $9\\%$   for the passivated  devices while up to  $45\\%$   loss for the control one (Figure 5e). We  attribute the excellent thermal stability of the passivated devices  to   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  –molecules interactions, i.e. Lewis adducts and  hydrogen bonding, which suppress   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   motion and desorption from the crystal. Similar observation has been reported by  Huang and co-workers, who found fullerene-defect interaction  at GBs could suppress the ion diffusion.  Notably, DTS shows  the higher thermal stability than other molecules, we speculate  the existence F element only in DTS, which is expected to form  strong hydrogen bonding energy with H atoms in  $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  , can be  the main reason for it.  \n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated stable high-performance perovskite solar cells with simultaneously improved  device performance and stability via introducing different  semiconducting molecules with Lewis acid and Lewis functional groups within the bulk film for trap state pass iv ation at  GBs. The strong interactions between molecules and precursors were found to trigger enhanced heterogeneous nucleation  of the crystalline solvate (MAPbI 3 ⋅ DMSO) during solutioncasting, which provide frameworks for the growth of compact film without significant gaps. The molecules uniformly  decorate GB throughout the depth of the perovskite film  without detrimental ly altering the micro structure and texture  of the perovskite film. These molecules simultaneously passivate   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{I}$   antisite defects or under-coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   vacancies at GBs. Importantly, it was found that molecules with  better energetic parity with   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   yield better pass iv ation  and intergrain charge transport due to shallower trap states.  Therefore, passivated   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   films with ITIC and DR3T  exhibit much improved op to electronic properties in contrast to  that based on PCBM and DTS, including lower trap densities,  higher hole/electron mobilities, lower recombination and  contact resistance, and more efficient charge dissociation and  extraction. The optimal devices exhibit significantly increased  PCE up to   $19.3\\%$   in planar n-i-p devices, as well as slight degradation of only   ${\\approx}13\\%$   after   $40\\textup{d}$   of exposure in   $50\\%$   relative  humidity at room temperature without encapsulation and  high thermal stability under inert atmosphere. The insights  of this work should guide the perovskite community to more  rationally design stable and highly efficient perovskite-based  op to electronic devices.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSolution Preparation : The solution preparation was conducted  under inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen glove box.
