Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

With further increasing the  adding amount, plenty of nanoparticles are covered on the  carbon fibers   $(500\\,\\mathrm{nm}{-1}\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   in diameter), but the carbon fibers  are partially tangled inversely (Figure 1d, NiCo@N-C 3). From  the SEM images in Figure 1, it can be concluded that the more  metal salts added, the higher loading of the NiCo alloy nanoparticles on carbon fibers and better separation of the carbon  fibers. However, without NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorating   $_\\mathrm{(N-C)}$   or overloading   $\\left(\\mathrm{NiCo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~~3\\right)$  ), the obtained carbon  fibers would be larger in diameter and tangled severely. On  one hand, without the decoration of NiCo alloy nanoparticles,  carbon nanofibers may merge more easily, and on the other  hand, too many nanoparticles need to be loaded on thicker  carbon fibers. Thus, these two reasons may result in the thicker  and tangled carbon fibers of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}3$  . The contents of NiCo alloy loading could be obtained from thermal  grav i metric analysis (TGA), which are   $19\\%$  ,   $39\\%$  , and   $52\\%$   for \n\n  $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$   1, NiCo  $\\,\\mathrm{\\mathfrak{o}}_{\\mathrm{@N-C~2}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\;\\;3$  3, respectively \n\n (seen in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).  \n\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns obtained from four different samples are displayed in Figure 1e. There no peak could  be detected in the range of  $40^{\\circ}–80^{\\circ}$   for the  $_{\\mathrm{N-C},}$   since it is pure  carbon nanofiber without NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorating.  In contrast, three distinctive peaks located at   $44.38^{\\circ}$  ,   $51.68^{\\circ}$  ,  and   $76.11^{\\circ}$   could be seen for   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~1$   and   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$  ,  especially for   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}3$   with strong intensities. These three  peaks right located in between those of Co (PDF#15-0806) and  Ni (PDF#04-0850), which could be corresponding to the (111),  (200), and (220) lattice planes for a metallic Co or Ni FCC  structure,  indicating that the nanoparticles decorated on  N-doped carbon nanofibers are NiCo alloy. Figure 1f gives the  Raman spectra of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$  . There are two peaks  centered at   ${\\approx}1340\\ \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   (D-band) and   $1599~\\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$   (G-band),  respectively.  The D-band is corresponding to the  $\\mathrm{A_{1g}}$   mode and  the finite-sized crystals of graphite. The G-band corresponded to  allowed vibrations of   $\\mathrm{E}_{2\\mathrm{g}}$   mode and could be observed in all   $\\mathrm{sp}\\!^{2}$  bonds in a graphitic network.  The ratio of intensities between  the D-band and G-band   $(I_{\\mathrm{D}}/I_{\\mathrm{G}})$   is generally used as an important criterion for the degree of defects of carbon materials and  a higher ratio represents more defects formed in the as-synthesized samples.  As shown in Figure 1f, the   $I_{\\mathrm{D}}/I_{\\mathrm{G}}$   ratios of the   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}\\,2$   are 0.97 and 1.20, respectively, indicating  that more defects contained in the   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C\\,}2$  . In addition, the  intense D peak of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$  2 could also be ascribed to the lattice distortion due to the fibrous structure of the   $\\mathrm{NeCo@N-C~}2$  .  \n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) image ( Figure   2 a)  of the NiCo@N-C 2 revealed that the NiCo alloy nanoparticles with size of about   $50\\;\\mathrm{\\nm}$   are distributed equally on  carbon nanofibers. The corresponding lattice fringes of the  NiCo alloy nano particle are shown in Figure 2b, which is  characterized with high-resolution transmission electron  microscope (HRTEM). The lattice fringe of   $0.2064\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   of the  sample   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   is close to the standard lattice fringes of  Ni   $(0.2034\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , PDF#04-0850) and Co   $\\,0.2047\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , PDF#15- 0806), which are corresponding to the (111) lattice planes of  pure Ni and Co. And the lattice fringe of   $0.1778\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   of the  sample   $\\mathrm{NIC}{\\omega}\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}{\\ }2$   is close to the standard lattice fringes of  Ni (  $(0.1762\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , PDF#04-0850) and Co   $(0.1772\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , PDF#15- 0806), which are related to the (200) lattice planes of Ni and  Co. Thus, all of these above consolidate that the nanoparticles  distributed on carbon nanofibers are NiCo alloy.  Elemental  mappings have also been performed and the results are shown  in Figure 2c. The black and white picture on the left with a  single carbon nanofiber is the original image for elemental  mapping. The four colorized images on the right are corresponding to C, N, Ni, and Co, respectively. From Figure 2c, we  could see that C and N are distributed homogeneously among  the whole nanofibers, indicating that the uniformly N doping  in the carbon nanofibers, while Ni and Co are only appeared  on the nanoparticles. The analysis of HRTEM combined with  SEM image (Figure 1c) indicates that the NiCo alloy nanoparticles are directly anchored on the N-doped carbon nanofibers,  which could provide enhanced electrical and chemical coupling  between the alloy and N-doped carbon nanofibers. This special  hybrid structure with intimate contact and uniformly dispersion  of non precious metal alloys on heteroatom-doped carbon fibers  might be favorable for achieving excellent electro catalytic performances for the ORR and OER processes as oxygen catalysts.  \n\nIn order to evaluate the ORR/OER catalytic activities, the  four catalysts were first loaded onto glassy carbon electrodes for  cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}.$  - or   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated   $0.1~\\mathrm{~M~}$  KOH solution at room temperature without rotation,  respectively.  And the scan rates are all   $50\\;\\mathrm{mV}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  .
