It  is demonstrated that PBGH can passivate the trap states of Sn  dangling bonds and O vacancies on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   surface via Lewis  acid/base coordination, and has strong interaction with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   to  improve the perovskite film quality. The modification of PBGH  enables improved PCE as high as   $24.79\\%$   compared to   $22.85\\%$    for the control device. In addition, the un encapsulated device  based on PBGH maintained over   $95\\%$   of the initial PCE after   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$   storage in ambient condition with a relative humidity  (RH) of   $25\\%$  . The st abilities of perovskite films and devices  under high temperature/humidity and light illumination conditions were also systematically studied.  \n\n# 2. Results and Discussion  \n\nPBGH was synthesized to modify the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}/$  perovskite interface, and the chemical structure is displayed in Figure  1a.  Aqueous solution of PBGH with an optimized concentration  of   $0.5~\\mathrm{mg~mL^{-1}}$   was spin-coated onto the glass/FTO/  ${\\mathrm{NO}}_{2}$   substrate. Top view scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic  force microscopy (AFM), and contact angle measurements  were employed to characterize the bare   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/P B G H}$    films preliminarily (Figure  1b,c). The SEM and AFM images  exhibit that the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film has no significant changes in surface  morphology and roughness after PBGH treatment. Notably,  the water contact angle is remarkably decreased from   $12.60^{\\circ}$    for the bare   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film to   $7.10^{\\circ}$   for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P B G H}$   film. This  illustrates that the hydrophilic it y of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film is improved,  which is attributed to the introduction of the   $\\mathrm{-COOH}$   functional group.  The improved hydrophilic it y is beneficial to  the deposition of perovskite precursor solution as well as the  growth of high-quality perovskite films.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/8d1fd81037c667763f50c76de356ad908f4ea5023ad88be13cc8b42c5058a588-1727105946.jpg)  \nFigure   2.   a) Mobility and b) conductivity measurements of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/$  PBGH films. c) The calculated energy band structure. d) KPFM surface  potentials of  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/$  PBGH films. e) SSPL and  $\\mathsf{f})$  ) TRPL curves of perovskite and PBGH/perovskite films. g) SSPL and h) TRPL curves of  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/$  perovskite and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/\\mathsf{P B G H}_{\\rho}$  /perovskite films. i) Cross-sectional SEM images of F  $\\mathsf{\\ddot{T O}/S n O_{2}(P B G H)}$  /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au.  \n\nSubsequently, top-view SEM and AFM images of the FTO/  $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}(P B G H)/F A_{0.9}C s_{0.1}P b I_{3}}$   films were obtained to study  the surface morph o logie s of the perovskite layers. Figure  1d  exhibits the SEM images of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2.}}$  /perovskite (control) and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P B G H/\\partial}$  /perovskite films. It is noteworthy that the grain  size of the perovskite film grown on the PBGH-modified  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  layer are significantly larger. The statistical diagram of the  perovskite grain size distribution depicted in Figure S1 (Supporting Information) also demonstrates that PBGH modification of the  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   layer is conducive to forming a uniform perov- skite film. Moreover, the XRD patterns shown in Figure S2  (Supporting Information) confirm the enhanced crystal lin it y  of the PBGH/perovskite film. According to the AFM images  displayed in Figure 1e, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness  values for the control and PBGH/perovskite films are measured to be 21.90 and   $16.00~\\mathrm{nm}$  , respectively, implying that the  PBGH/perovskite film is composed of high-quality perovskite  grains with smoother surface. The contact angle images of the  control and PBGH/perovskite films are shown in Figure 1f. It  is clear that the hydrophobic it y of the PBGH/perovskite film  is enhanced, which is ascribed to its enlarged perovskite grain  size and smooth film surface.  \n\nSpace-charge-limited  current  (SCLC)  measurements  were performed on the samples with configurations of FTO/  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}(\\mathrm{PBGH})/\\mathrm{Au}$   to appraise the effects of PBGH on the charge  transfer characteristics of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   films. The film conductivity calculated by the equation of   $I=\\sigma\\mathrm{AL}^{-1}~V,^{[36]}$   is dramatically increased from   $2.12\\times10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mS\\cm^{-1}}$   for bare   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film  to   $4.92\\times10^{-3}~\\mathrm{mS~cm^{-1}}$   for the   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/P B G H}$   film, suggesting  enhanced electron transport after PBGH treatment ( Figure   2 a;  Table S1, Supporting Information).   $J^{1/2}{-}V$  curves are plotted  in Figure  2b and the mobilities of the films are calculated  according to the Mott–Gurney equation   $J\\,=\\,9\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}\\upmu\\mathrm{V}^{2}\\,\\,8\\mathrm{L}^{-3}.$  The electron mobilities for bare   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and the   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/P B G H}$  films are   $1.35\\times10^{-3}$   and   $1.62\\times10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}~\\mathrm{V}^{-1}~\\mathrm{S}^{-1},$  , respectively,  with corresponding parameters listed in Table S2 (Supporting  Information), confirming the improved electronic transmission  ability.  \n\nUltraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV–vis  spectrophotometer measurements were further employed to  elucidate the effect of PBGH modification on the band structure, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table S3  (Supporting Information).
