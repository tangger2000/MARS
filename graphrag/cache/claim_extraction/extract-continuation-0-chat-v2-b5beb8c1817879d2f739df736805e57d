Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As shown in Figure 2d–f, both   $\\mathrm{FPMAI_{0.7}B r_{0.3}};$   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$   and FPMATFA have pass iv ation effect and  result in higher PLQY than the control film (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Notably, the perovskite film shows a  relatively high PLQY of   $15\\%$   with   $40\\%$   molar extra FPMATFA  even at a low excitation intensity of   $0.008\\mathrm{~mW~}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . Bi-exponential decays were used to fit the TRPL curves. The slow decay  component could be attributed to radiative recombination,  while the fast decay component could be ascribed to nonradiative recombination.  As shown in  Table   1 , the average decay  time increases from 54.2 to 63.3 ns with   $60\\%$     $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$  .  In contrast, the average decay time increases to 162.2 ns with   $40\\%$   extra FPMATFA. Both   $T_{\\mathrm{average}}$   and PLQY decrease with  FPMATFA molar ratio reaching   $\\bar{80\\%}$  . This might be due to  formation of too much quasi-2D phases in the film.  We  further calculate the radiative and non radiative recombination  rate   $(k_{\\mathrm{rad}},\\,k_{\\mathrm{nonrad}})$   of the films using equation   $\\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{average}}}\\!=\\!k_{\\mathrm{rad}}+\\!k_{\\mathrm{nonrad}}$  and   $\\mathrm{PLQY}\\,{=}\\,\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rad}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rad}}+k_{\\mathrm{nonrad}}}$  . As shown in Table 1, with   $40\\%$   molar  excess of FPMATFA, the film has lowest non radiative recombination rate of   $4.51\\times10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , further demonstrating its better  pass iv ation effect.  \n\nThe improved optical properties of MHP films with  FPMATFA enable us to fabricate efficient PeLEDs.

SEM surface images show reduced grain sizes after incorporation of FPMATFA additives as compared with the control  film (Figure   $\\mathrm{S7a-e}$  , Supporting Information).

Excitingly, the EQE reaches   $18.3\\%$   and   $20.9\\%$  , respectively, after  incorporation of   $20\\%$   and   $40\\%$   molar excess of FPMATFA, a  rather high value for mixed-halide PeLEDs. It should be noted  that the EQE reaches above   $3\\%$   at a low current density of   $0.01\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}^{-2}}$  , supporting low trap density in the perovskite  layer.
