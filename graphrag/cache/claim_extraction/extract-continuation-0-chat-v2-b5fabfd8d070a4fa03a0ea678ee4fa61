Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Both SM-HTMs show similar photo physical  and electrochemical properties but greatly different molecular  configuration and film morphological properties. While there  is a complex interplay between HTM properties and device  performance, it was found that the film morphology played  more important part in determining the device performance  compared to transmittance, energy level alignment, and hole  mobility. This is likely due to the significant effects of underlying HTM film properties on the crystallization of the perovskite film deposited on top, as well as the interface quality and  consequently inter facial recombination losses. Hence, due to  good energy level alignment, appropriate hole-transporting  ability, and most importantly, the excellent film morphology  (i.e., high thermal stability, smooth surface, increased hydrophobicity, and improved pass iv ation effect), the MPA-BTTI-based  PVSC exhibits an excellent PCE of   $21.17\\%$   with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.12,  a   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $23.23\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , and an FF of   ${\\approx}81\\%$   as well as a negligible hysteresis, marking the record PCE value for PVSCs  with dopant-free SM-HTMs reported to date. More importantly,  good long-term stability was realized in the MPA-BTTI-based  device which retains  $90\\%$   of its initial PCE after   $500\\;\\mathrm{h}$   constant  illumination and simultaneously maintains   $94\\%$   of its initial  PCE after   $800\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$   thermal stress at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . The study not only  breaks the long-time standing bottleneck in the development of  dopant-free SM-HTMs but also paves the way to explore other  dopant-free SM-HTMs for highly efficient inverted PVSCs.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.W. and W.C. contributed equally to this work.
