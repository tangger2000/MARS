The PSC can generate a short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$   of   $23.08\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and  an open-circuit potential   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$   of 1.08 V, with a fill factor (FF)  \n\nof 0.76 (Figure 4b). The corresponding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC is   $18.82\\%$  . Before the assembly of the  PEC/PV tandem device, the performance of the front 2-BVO1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes and the rear PSC were  evaluated independently. The   $J{-}V$  curves of the rear PSC were  obtained under AM   $1.5~\\mathrm{~G~}$   illumination filtered by the front  2-BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes. The operating  photo current density   $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{OP}}\\right)$   and the operating potential   $(U_{\\mathrm{OP}})$   of  the PEC/PV tandem device can be defined according to the intersection of the individual two-electrode   $J{-}V$   curves (Figure 4b).  Compared to the  $J{-}V$   curve of the PSC under AM   $1.5\\,\\mathrm{G}$   illumination, the photo current densities of the PSC decrease dramatically  when filtered by the 2-BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo­ anodes. However, the short-circuit photo current density of the  PSC is still higher than the 2-BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual  photo anodes, indicating that the  $J_{\\mathrm{OP}}$   of the PSC is high enough  for the tandem system. It can be observed that the tandem  device can achieve a remarkably high   $J_{\\mathrm{OP}}$   of  $5.27\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , indicating that the   $_{2\\cdot\\mathrm{BVO}\\cdot1.5\\mathrm{h/FeOOH/NSiOOH}}$   dual photo anodes  are excellent candidates for PEC/PV tandem systems. The longterm current density versus time   $\\left(J-t\\right)$   performance of the PEC/ PV tandem device was also measured at   $0\\ \\mathrm{V}$   versus the counter  electrode of Pt. As shown in Figure   $4\\mathrm{c}$  , the current density is  well matched with the   $J_{\\mathrm{OP}}$   of   $5.27~\\mathrm{mA~cm}^{-2}$  , which equals to a  STH efficiency of   ${\\approx}6.5\\%$   according to the equation   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{STH}}=J_{\\mathrm{OP}}\\times$   $1.23/P$   (  ${}^{\\circ}P$   is the power of the illuminating light).  The STH  efficiency achieved in this work is among the highest reported  BVO/PSC tandem systems (Table S4, Supporting Information).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/363fd18e1791f362f8395ea1f9fc0827fd9812fefac0c83671b0ef79d4ce0762-1727117589.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a) Schematic of the 2-BVO-FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes coupled with a sealed perovskite solar cell (PSC). b) The measured PEC performance under AM   ${}^{1.5}\\odot$   illumination. I:  $J^{-V}$   curve of PSC, II:  $J^{-V}$   curve of PSC behind the 2-BVO-FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes, III:  $J^{-V}$   curve  of the 2-BVO-FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes. c) Stability of unassisted water splitting (0 V vs the counter electrode Pt): the corresponding STH  values are calculated from the photo current densities.  \n\nAfter   $10\\textrm{h}$   of consecutive light illumination, only   $3.8\\%$   decay of  the photo current density is observed, indicating the decent stability of the PEC/PV tandem device.  \n\nIn summary, we have reported a facile electrode position and  thermal treatment method to fabricate a planar   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   film  with enriched oxygen vacancies. After deposition of   $\\mathrm{FeOOH}/$  NiOOH dual OECs on the optimized BVO-1.5h film, the BVO1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH film can deliver a remarkably high  photo current density of   $5.13\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$   at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE.  With an identical BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH film located  behind the BVO-1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH film to form 2-BVO1.5h/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photo anodes, the light utilization at   $400{-}520~\\mathrm{nm}$   is increased, resulting in an enhanced photocurrent density of   $5.87~\\mathrm{mA~cm}^{-2}$   at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE. The dual  photo anodes in tandem with a single-sealed PSC can generate  a photo current density of   $5.27\\ \\mathrm{mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , corresponding to a  theoretical STH efficiency of   ${\\approx}6.5\\%$  . This study demonstrates  a simple and cost-effective method to prepare planar   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$  films for efficient and stable unbiased PEC water splitting.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was supported by Australian Research Council through its  DP, FF, and DECRA programs.
