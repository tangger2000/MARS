As  displayed in Figure 5d, the PCE of the PBGH-modified device  retains   $95\\%$   of the initial PCE after   $1000\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$  , exhibiting excellent  dark ambient stability. However, under the same condition, the  PCE of the control device drops down to  $77\\%$   of the initial PCE.

Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, it is demonstrated that the incorporation of PBGH  molecules at the buried interface of the PSC plays important  role in improving the device performance. Systematic al charact eri zat ions illustrate that PBGH modification plays a role in  high-quality perovskite film formation and charge recombination inhibition, contributing to the fabrication of efficient and  stable PSCs with high reproducibility. The interactions between  PBGH and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   enlarge the grain sizes of the perovskite films  and restrain the non radiative recombination caused by defects  at the buried interface. Meanwhile, PBGH can passivate the   $\\mathrm{Sn}$    dangling bonds and O vacancies on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   surface via Lewis  acid/base coordination, contributing to the increased conductivity of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film and accelerated electron transfer. The  PBGH-modified PSCs exhibit significantly increased champion efficiency of   $24.79\\%$  , with high   $\\mathrm{V_{OC}}$   of 1.197 V and FF of   $82.76\\%$  , compared with that of the control devices. In addition,  the PBGH-modified devices without encapsulation retain   $95\\%$    of the initial PCE after storage for   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$   under dark ambient  condition with relative humidity of   $25\\%$  . The strategy of modifying multi functional small molecules at the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/}$  perovskite  interface provides an effective method to further improve the  efficiency and stability of PSCs.  \n\n# 4.

Lithium-bis-(tri flu oro methyl s ulf on yl) imide (Li-TFSI,  ${\\geq}99.9\\%$    and 4-tert but yl pyr i dine (t-BP) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich.  \n\nChl oro benzene (CB), diethyl ether, acetone and hydrogen chloride (HCl)  were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the  materials were used without any further purification.  \n\nSynthesis of PBGH : PABA of   $0.02\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  ,   $0.02\\,\\mathsf{\\ m o l\\,}\\mathsf{H C l}$  , and   $60\\ \\mathrm{\\mum}$  deionized water were loaded into a 3-neck flask with a magnetic stirrer.  DCDA   $(0.04\\ m o l)$  ) was added in portions after complete dissolution of  PABA. The mixed materials were heated to   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   and held for   $6~\\mathsf{h}$  , with  continuously stirring. After complete reaction, light yellow transparent  solution was obtained. The solution was spin steamed to remove most  of the solvent and then acetone was added to precipitate the product.  The reaction product was filtered and then re crystallized in mixed  solvents of acetone and deionized water. The PBGH was ultimately  obtained and dried in vacuum condition.  \n\nSolution Preparation : Different molar quantity of PBGH was added  into  $\\mathsf{I}~\\mathsf{m L}$   ultra-pure water and stirred for complete dissolution. Tin (IV)  oxide colloidal dispersion liquid was diluted by ultra-pure water. The   $\\mathsf{F A O}.9\\mathsf{C s}0.1\\mathsf{P b}13$   perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing  1 mmol PbI2, 0.9 mmol FAI, 0.1 mmol CsI,   $0.8\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$   DMF, and   $0.2\\ \\mathsf{m L}$  DMSO. The precursor solution was stirred for   $^\\mathrm{~4~h~}$   and then filtered  through  $0.45~\\upmu\\mathsf{m}$   syringe filter for later use. For HTL precursor solution,   $90~\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}$   Spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in   $\\mathsf{I m L}$   CB, doped with   $36~\\upmu L$   t-BP  and  $22\\,\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   acetonitrile solution of Li-TFSI   $(520~\\mathsf{m g\\;m L^{-1}})$  ).  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The   $2\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (PBGH<|>PSCs<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The incorporation of PBGH molecules at the buried interface of the PSC plays an important role in improving the device performance.
