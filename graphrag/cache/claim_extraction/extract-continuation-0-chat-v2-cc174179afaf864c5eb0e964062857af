Influence of Atmosphere on Stability  \n\nAtmospheric gases (oxygen and water) have profound influence during fabrication and during device operation. MHPs  are considered chemically inert in nitrogen (and in other inert  gases) and in vacuum. In the presence of residual humidity,  water diffuses quickly in MHPs (time-scale of seconds) and  the process occurs readily at relatively low levels of humidity  (  $(\\mathrm{RH}\\,\\approx\\,10\\%)$  .  In PeSCs, moderate levels of humidity causes  water-assisted re solvation and recrystallization of MHPs, and  therefore is widely considered to be beneficial during device  fabrication.  However, humidity can accelerate the degradation of MHPs under illumination. Ab initio molecular dynamics  simulations have further revealed surface reconstruction and  light-assisted formation of hydrated species of   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}\\cdot\\mathrm{H}_{2}O_{3}^{\\circ}}$  ;  these phenomena explain why simultaneous exposure to water  and light accelerates degradation of MHPs.  Despite the  fast diffusion of water within MHP layers, PeLEDs based on  a   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  –polymer composite retain basic operation ability  when operated under ambient conditions   $\\mathrm{~\\cal{RH}~}\\approx~60\\%$   and   $30~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  ;  this temporary stability indicates that cladding the  MHPs with organic (polymer and organic small molecules) or  inorganic layers provides at least some barrier function against  diffusion of atmospheric components.  \n\nThe influence of oxygen is more complex than that of  other gases.

The boost effect has  been demonstrated by atmosphere-dependent PL experiments;  its origin has been identified as light-induced trap states that  are efficiently passivated by oxygen.  This phenomenon is  closely related to the pass iv ation of defects by Lewis bases,   which are thought to passivate the dangling bonds of   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   left  behind by formation of halide vacancies.  The oxygen-related  degradation mechanism was proposed to be based on the formation of superoxide species   $(\\mathrm{O}_{2}{}^{-})$   in the presence of ultraviolet  (UV) light and oxygen ( Figure   3 A).  Its reaction with the  MA moiety leads to rapid decomposition of the perovskite, and  replacing   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   with an un protonated cation may therefore lead  to an MHP with increased stability with respect to oxygen  and  light.  The validity of this idea is supported by the  increased humidity and photo stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   over  organic–inorganic hybrid per ovsk ites in some cases,  but  the thermal stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   is also higher, so the effects  are difficult to discern. Degradation mechanisms include  redox reactions at electrodes or inter layers (Section 2.2).
