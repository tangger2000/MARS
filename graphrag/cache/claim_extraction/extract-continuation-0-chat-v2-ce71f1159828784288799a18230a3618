Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The process involves mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in a good solvent (DMF) with a poor solvent (toluene or hexane) containing long-chain organic ligands. This mixing process induces controlled crystallization, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots. The use of different solvents and ligands allows for precise control over the nanoparticle formation, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of the resulting quantum dots.<|>The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The devices  were swept from zero bias to forward bias with scan rate of   $0.02\\ \\mathsf{V}\\ \\mathsf{s}^{-1}$  .  IPCE measurements were carried out in DC mode by using a Keithley  2400 source meter and a SOFN 7ISW752 monochromator equipped  with a 500 W Xenon lamp. The wavelength sampling interval was  $\\mathsf{T0\\ n m}$  and the current sampling time was 1  s, which was fully controlled by  computer. A Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon diode used for IPCE  measurements was calibrated at the National Institute of Metrology,  China. For LED device characterizations, a Keithley 2400 source meter  was used for  $J^{-V}$   measurement and a fiber integration sphere (FOIS-1)  couple with a QE65 Pro spectrometer was used for the light output  measurement.  \n\nFilm Characterization : The absorbance spectra were measured by a  UV–vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Perkin Elmer,  Lambda 950). The PL spectra were measured by using a QE65 Pro  spectrometer and a  $445\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   CW laser as an excitation source. XRD data  were obtained by using a Bruker D8 Advance.

The SEM images of perovskite  films were obtained by using a JEOL5 JSM-7800F SEM. The surface  morphology of perovskite film was collected by AFM (Bruker, Dimension  Icon SPM). GIWAXS measurements were performed at the SAXS/WAXS  beamline at the Australian Synchrotron.    $12\\ \\mathsf{k e V}$   photons were used,  with 2D scattering patterns recorded on a Dectris Pilatus 1M detector.  A sample to detector distance of  ${\\approx}34.1$   cm was used, with the sampleto-detector distance calibrated with a silver behenate sample. Exposure  times of 1 s were used, with a fresh spot used for each different angle to  avoid beam damage.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nR.Y. and R.L. contributed equally to this work.
