Notably, the perovskite layer on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   showed more small  domains between the adjacent large domains, and may suffer  from compressive strain. We further investigated this issue by  comparing the cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite  layers (Figure  1e). On pristine   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  , the perovskite domains  distributed randomly without preferred directions. However, on   $\\mathrm{subseteqO_{2}–H P}$  , an integral domain formed, and almost no visible  grain boundary can be observed. We propose this is resulted  from a vertically aligned crystal growth of per ovsk ites on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  –HP layer. Since  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  –HP layer possessed larger domains  together with higher surface free energy, a more homogeneous  crystal nucleation of the perovskite may occur (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The homogeneous crystal nucleation  resulted in a consistent environment for the crystal growth  along the direction that was parallel to the substrate, and thus  induced a vertical distribution of the perovskite domains. Particularly, we do not propose the perovskite layer is composed  by horizontally distributed single crystal grains, but phase  domains without preferred crystal orientation. This is also supported by the results of GIXRD measurements, for which the  perovskite layer on   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}–H P}$   showed a brighter scattered ring  that corresponds to the (001) plane of the metal halide perovskite (Figure 1f).  \n\nTo shed light on the influence of HP on the interface contact between the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL and the perovskite layer, the interactions between   $\\mathrm{{SnO_{2}/H P}}$  , and between HP/Perovskite were  further investigated. According to the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, all the four functional groups  in the two repeat units in HP monomer (  $\\scriptstyle\\left(-\\mathrm{COO^{-}}\\right.$  ;   $-\\mathrm{OSO}_{3}^{-}$  ;   $\\mathrm{-CH_{2}O S O_{3}^{-}}$  ;   $-\\mathrm{NHSO}_{3}^{-})$  ) are able to absorb on the surface of  lead-based per ovsk ites and  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano crystals (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Thus, we anticipated that HP can work as  a bridge between the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and perovskite, and strengthen the  interface contact.  \n\nWe first conducted Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to confirm the bonding between   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and HP. As  shown in  Figure   2 a, HP show characteristic peaks at 1666 and   $1238\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-1}$  , which are assigned to the symmetric stretching  vibrations of   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$   and   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{S=O}}$   bonds.  When   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   was  incorporated with HP, the peak of   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   significantly shifted  to lower wavenumber of   $1642\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-1}$  , while the peak of   $S{=}\\mathrm{O}$    stayed almost unchanged (shifted from 1238 to   $1241~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , the  zoom-in images are presented in Figure S13 in the Supporting  Information). This indicates   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   mainly has interactions with   $\\mathrm{-COO^{-}}$   on HP, leaving the   $-{\\mathrm{SO}}_{3}^{-}$   unaffected. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were further conducted  to confirm the interaction between   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and HP is based on  the bonding to Sn atoms. As shown in Figure 2b, the Sn   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$    (494.81 eV) and Sn   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   (486.42 eV) peaks of pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    shifted to lower positions at 494.48 and   $486.01~\\mathrm{eV}$   after incorporating with HP (the full spectra are presented in Figure S14  in the Supporting Information), which indicated an increased  electron density around the Sn atom due to the interaction  to HP. Confirming the bonding of HP to   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   can help us  understand the mechanism for stabilizing the dispersion and  regulating the arrangement of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   nano crystals. At the same  time, it ensures that HP can homogeneously distribute within  the   $\\mathrm{subseteqO_{2}–H P}$   thin film, since they are not physically mixed  but chemically anchored on the surface of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano crystals.  As shown in the elemental mapping image in Figure  2c, the  distributions of potassium, sulfur, and carbon are nicely consistent with that of tin and oxygen, indicating HP homogeneously distributed on the surface of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   nano crystals. For the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   thin film, HP also homogeneously distributed within the  whole film, as shown in Figure S15 (Supporting Information).  \n\nFor the interaction between HP and per ovsk ites, we propose  it is created by the chemical affinity of   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   toward sulfate species   $(-S O_{3}^{-})$  .  This assumption was verified by comparing FTIR  and XPS spectra of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , HP, and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{-HF}$   mixture. The shift  of characteristic peak of   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{S=O}}$   in FTIR spectra from   $1238~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$    for pristine HP to   $1226\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   for   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{-HF}$   indicated interactions  to   $-{\\mathrm{SO}}_{3}^{-}$   from   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   (Figure S16, Supporting Information), and  the decreased binding energy for  $\\mathrm{Pb}\\;4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Pb}\\;4\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   peaks in  XPS spectra further confirmed the interaction came from   $\\mathrm{Pb}$    atoms (Figure S17, Supporting Information).  \n\nThe bridging effect of HP between   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and per ovsk ites not  only strengths the interface contact, but also results in the vertical crystal growth of perovskite. HP on the surface of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$    nano crystals can induce the crystal nucleation of per ovsk ites,  and thus the ordered   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano crystals in the domain can  lead to a well matched perovskite domain on top. In this case,  we assume an improved lattice matching between these two  layers is also attained. This will benefit the electric contact, and  thus accelerate the charge transfer at the interface. According  to steady-state photo luminescence (PL) results, both   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}–H P}$   can efficiently extract electrons from the perovskite  layer on top (Figure 2d). To quantify this process, time-resolved  photo luminescence (TRPL) spectra were collected and fitted  by bi exponential decay function. As shown in Figure  2e and  Table S2 (Supporting Information), the per ovsk ites on   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2^{-}}}$  HP shows much shorter lifetimes (  $\\tau_{1}$   of 5.21 ns,   $\\tau_{2}$   of 40.76 ns)  than that on  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (  $\\tau_{1}$   of 7 .95 ns,   $\\tau_{2}$   of 100.86 ns), indicating more  efficient electron transfer to the ETL. Besides the enhanced  interface contact, we also anticipated that the improved lattice  matching between the stacked two layers is able to reduce the  residual strain at the ETL/perovskite interface and in the perovskite layer, which has been proven to play a dominant role for\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (SnO2<|>NONE<|>MATERIAL PROPERTY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The SnO2 layer possesses larger domains together with higher surface free energy, which may result in a more homogeneous crystal nucleation of the perovskite.<|>Since SnO2–HP layer possessed larger domains together with higher surface free energy, a more homogeneous crystal nucleation of the perovskite may occur (Figure S11, Supporting Information).)\n##\n(SnO2<|>NONE<|>MATERIAL PROPERTY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The SnO2 layer has interactions with the -COO- group on HP, leaving the -SO3- group unaffected.<|>When SnO2 was incorporated with HP, the peak of C=O significantly shifted to lower wavenumber of 1642 cm-1, while the peak of S=O stayed almost unchanged (shifted from 1238 to 1241 cm-1, the zoom-in images are presented in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information).
