Unfortunately,  the obtained EL characteristic was insufficient, compared  to the conventional   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  -based LEDs. The maximum  luminance was   ${\\approx}10$   cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  . This low performance may be  attributed to the unfavorable energy level alignment. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis revealed that  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   has the shallow electron affinity (EA) of   ${\\approx}2.7$   eV  and deep ionization potential (IP) of   ${\\approx}6.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   (see Figure S10,  Supporting Information), compared to the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  .  Consequently, the large barrier heights for the electron/hole injection  will be the main reason of such an insufficient EL characteristic. This infers that the EL characteristic can be potentially  improved by attaining energy-level matching.  \n\nIn this work, the exploration of the low-dimensional compounds based on   $\\mathrm{{Cu}(I)}$   halide proved to be a novel route to  obtain   $\\mathrm{Pb}$  -free and high-PLQY luminescent material. The proposed   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   has a high PLQY of   $90\\%$   and good air-stability.  These advantageous properties originate from the unique 0D  electronic structure. Each   $\\mathrm{Cu-I}$   photo active site is separated  by Cs ions; this arrangement may be considered a host–guest  system. An embedded core/shell structure is effective for  enhancing the PL by confining the exciton into the photo­ active site; this accounts for the large exciton binding energy   $(\\approx\\!492\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\meV}})$  . By considering the Jahn–Teller distortion of the  Cu tetrahedral site, we proposed that the photo luminescence  originates from excited-state structural reorganization. Further,  the solution-process ability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   enabled fabrication of  thin films to demonstrate a blue LED.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : Cesium iodide (CsI,   $99.9\\%)$   copper(I) iodide (CuI, \n\n  $99.999\\%)$  ,  dimethyl form amide  (DMF,   $99.8\\%$  ),  dimethyl s ulf oxide \n\n (DMSO,  ${\\tt\\ge}99.5\\%$  , and PDMS (Sylgard 184) were purchased from SigmaAldrich. Methanol (MeOH) was purchased from Wako. Each precursor  and solvent was used without further purification.  \n\nFabrication of the 0D   $C s_{3}C u_{2}I_{5}$   Thin Film : The CsI–CuI (CsI:CuI molar  ratio of 3:2) solution was prepared using DMSO and DMF as a mixed  solvent. The solution concentration was   $0.7~\\mathrm{{M}}$  . The precursor solution  was stirred overnight at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  . Subsequently, a thin film was formed by  spin-coating of the filtered solutions at 3000 rpm for  $60~\\mathrm{s}$  . The resulting  thin film was annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\texttt{l h}$   in an argon-filled glove box   $(\\mathsf{O}_{2}<\\mathsf{I}$   ppm).  \n\nSingle-Crystal Growth of   $C s_{3}C u_{2}I_{5};$   A 1  m  solution of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{5}$   precursors  was prepared under ambient conditions under stirring at  $60\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for  $4\\,\\mathsf{h}$   until  no powder was observed in the solvent. Then, the solution was titrated by  MeOH. During the titration, a brown color appeared owing to precipitation  and quickly disappeared at dissolution. When the solution reached close  to the saturation point, permanent powder was left in the solution. This  saturated solution was filtered using PTFE   $0.45\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   pore size syringe filters.  \n\nThe crystal was grown by VSA.  The scheme of the crystallization  setup is shown in Figure  S1 (Supporting Information). The filtered  solution was injected in a vial and covered with a paraffin film with a  small hole. The covered vial was placed inside a beaker filled with MeOH  (anti solvent). Then, this beaker was also sealed by a paraffin film. In this  case, the paraffin film was used to balance the anti solvent atmosphere  and protect the condensing anti solvent. Finally, this beaker was placed  on a hotplate at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $48~\\mathsf{h}$   to grow a single crystal. Thereafter, a   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{5}$   single crystal of size  ${\\approx}5$   mm was obtained.  \n\nCharacterization Methods : Single-crystal XRD data were collected  using a four-axis diffraction-ruled meter (Rigaku: R-AXIS RAPID II, Mo   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  radiation), where the crystal was mounted on a glass capillary. The  unit cell refinement was performed using software (Rigaku: Crystal Clear).  The atomic arrangement of the single crystal was investigated using a  transmission electron microscope (JEOL: JEM-2010F). The composition  was obtained through a scanning electron microscope with electron  probe micro analyzer (SEM-EPMA) (JEOL: JSM-7600F). The energy level  was evaluated by UPS (Scienta Omicron: EA-125, He I light excitation).  \n\nThe standard PL spectrum was obtained with a fluorescence  spectrophotometer (Hitachi: F-4500). The bandgap energy was  estimated from the optical absorption spectra for the thin film, obtained  with a spectrometer (Hitachi: UH4150). The temperature dependence  and decay profiles for the PL spectra were measured by using the fourth  harmonic of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser   $(266\\;\\mathsf{n m},\\,\\mathsf{l o}\\;\\mathsf{H z},\\,0.6\\;\\mathsf{m}\\mathsf{J}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2})$   and a  spectrometer (Newport: MS257) equipped with a fast-gated intensified  CCD camera (Andor: iStar DH720), where the sample temperature was  changed with a closed-cycle He cryostat in the range   $30{-}350\\;\\;\\mathsf{K}.$   The  PLQY data were acquired using an absolute quantum yield measurement  system (Hamamatsu Photonics: CS9920-02).  \n\nFabrication of the White Luminescence Film and Inverted LED Devices : To  form a white luminescence film, the blue   $(\\mathsf C s_{3}\\mathsf C\\mathsf u_{2}|_{5})$   and a yellow phosphor  were mixed at different mixture ratio with PDMS. The resulting PDMS  film was heated at  $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $\\rceil\\textsf{h}$   in an argon-filled glove box. The inverted  LED was fabricated on the ITO   $(150\\ \\mathsf{n m})$  ) patterned glass substrate. ZSO   $(120\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m})$   was employed as electron injection/transport layer.  It was  deposited on the ITO-patterned glass substrate by radio frequency  sputtering. The substrate was cleaned by UV treatment for 15 min. A  solution of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{C u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{5}$   was spin-coated at   $3000\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for  $60~\\mathrm{s}$   and annealed at   $100\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for  $\\rceil\\textsf{h}$   in an argon-filled glove box. Next, the sample was transferred  to a vacuum chamber for the sequential deposition of NPD   $(50\\;\\mathsf{n m})$   (hole  transport layer),   $\\mathsf{M o O}_{x}$   (7 nm) (hole injection layer), and   $\\math\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (PL<|>NONE<|>PERFORMANCE METRIC<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The obtained EL characteristic was insufficient, compared to the conventional $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$ -based LEDs.
