These devices also showed high reproducibility (Figure 6e,f) with an average peak current efficiency  from 40 devices as high as 61.2, 59.6, 57.4, and 53.7 cd   $\\mathsf{A}^{-1}$   for  LEDs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnBr_{2^{-}}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{MnBr_{2}}\\cdot$  ,   $\\mathrm{InBr}_{3}.$  , and   $\\mathrm{GBaBr}_{3}$  -passivated  QDs.

The present result demonstrates a record for perovskite-based QLEDs  through OIHL pass iv ation, which has met the requirements of  the practical applications. However, device stability is still an  urgent issue warranting exploration in perovskite-based LEDs.  The stability of the QLEDs in this study was tested under a  constant injection current in   $\\Nu_{2}$   (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The luminance decreased gradually, and finally the  devices with a life-time of  ${\\approx}140\\,\\mathrm{min}$   are higher than the device  based on primal QDs (  $(40\\,\\mathrm{\\min})$  ). The devices were thus comparable to the Br-related perovskite with   $100\\ \\mathrm{min}$   stability in  previous report,  even showing a slight improvement.  \n\nFurther improvement of perovskite-based LED stability is  necessary. The ion migration under voltage bias is a major  issue leading to device instability.  Several strategies can be  proposed to improve LED stability such as developing stable  perovskite-emitting materials,  adding suitable molecules to  suppress ion movements,  using effective ligands to reduce  defect sites  and identifying stable carrier injection and transportation layers.  Thus, highly stable perovskite QLEDs are  expected to be developed to suit the requirements of future  practical applications.  \n\nIn summary, we report a generalized and simple OIHL passivation strategy to treat perovskite QDs for high-performance  LEDs. The IR and XPS results showed that organic–inorganic  hybrid ligands were adhered to the QD surface. Importantly,  OIHL pass iv ation contributed to QD films with highly emissive features and effective electrical transportation properties.  The LEDs based on QDs through OIHL with   $Z\\mathrm{nBr}_{2}$   exhibited a  maximum peak EQE of   $16.48\\%$  , which is the highest efficiency  of perovskite-film-based LEDs and QLEDs to this point. Meanwhile, various metal bromides, such as   $\\mathrm{MnBr}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{GaBr}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{InBr}_{3}$  , could feasibly be used to passivate perovskite QDs  through the proposed OIHL strategy to enhance device performance with a nearly   $40\\%$   improvement. The proposed OIHL  pass iv ation strategy for highly efficient LEDs therefore moves  perovskite QD emitters closer to industrialization.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis of Metal-Bromide-Passivated Perovskite   $C s P b B r_{3}$  -Based   $Q D s$  :  For the synthesis of  $Z\\mathsf{n B r}_{2}$  -passivated  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs,  $0.85~\\mathsf{m L}$   of a cesium  precursor (0.1  m    $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   in OTAc) and   $0.15~\\mathrm{{mL}}$   FA precursor   $(0.1~\\mathrm{~M~}$  form amid in e acetate (FA(Ac)) in OTAc) were swiftly added into   $9\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$  of a   $\\mathsf{P b}^{2+}$   solution (0.1  m  $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   and   $0.2~\\mathrm{M}$   tetra oct yl ammonium bromide  (TOAB) in toluene).
