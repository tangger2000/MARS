Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

In this work, the imaging measurement  is a conceptual demonstration for the present FAMACs SC  materials for X-ray imaging applications. To achieve commercial products, the X-ray detectors are often integrated to linear  detector arrays or large flat panel arrays for fast and high-resolution X-ray imaging. We believe that the perovskite SC X-ray  imaging system will be able to obtain higher resolution and  faster imaging in the future after the X-ray has been well collimated, smaller size detector pixels are prepared and integrated  them onto readout circuity.  \n\nBy incorporating smaller cations and anions into the   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  perovskite, the stress in the structure is reduced and vacancy  defects are significantly decreased. As a result, the formed  inch-sized triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite single crystals (FAMACs SCs) exhibit high ion migration activation  energy, ultra-low trap density, long carrier lifetime and diffusion length, large charge mobility, and excellent uniformity.  These superior properties were utilized for constructing sensitive X-ray detectors that show stable X-ray response and  the highest sensitivity among all perovskite devices reported  to date. Finally, the FAMACs SC detectors can be integrated  into a detector array with uniform X-ray response and realized  high-contrast X-ray imaging. It is expected that the effective  triple-cation mixed halide strategy and the availability of these  inch-sized high-quality SCs will inspire next-generation X-ray  imaging systems.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/5b4d963b1f8af253342ec2ed33ed4d2bcf0146da17f6dddddfbe2ac3049a3648-1723836112.jpg)  \nFigure   6.   X-ray imaging of the FAMACs SC detectors. a) Schematic illustration of X-ray imaging measurement of the FAMACs SC X-ray detector.  b,c) An open and closed black plastic box with two steel objects inside. d,e) The corresponding X-ray images of the closed black plastic box measured  from the FAMACs SC X-ray detector freshly prepared and after 60 days of storing.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nDetail experiments and methods are provided in the Supporting  Information.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was funded by the National Key Research and Development  Program of China (2017YFA0204800/2016YFA0202403), the program  of China Scholarship Council (CSC NO. 201906870044), the National  Natural Science Foundation of China (91733301/61704098/61604091),  the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  (XD A 17040506), the DNL Cooperation Fund CAS (DNL180311), the 111  Project (B14041), and the Changjiang Scholar and Innovative Research  Team (IRT_14R33).
