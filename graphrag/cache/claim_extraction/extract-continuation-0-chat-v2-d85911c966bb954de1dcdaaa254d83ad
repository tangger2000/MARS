For preparing Cs–oleate solution,   $0.814~\\mathrm{g}$   of  $\\mathsf{C s C O}_{3}$   (Aldrich,  $99.9\\%)$  ) and  $2.5~\\mathsf{m L}$   of oleic acid (OA, Aldrich   $90\\%)$  ) were reacted in   $40~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of octadecene (ODE, Aldrich,   $90\\%$  ) under   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   condition at   $\\ 750\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   until all  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   reacted with OA. After then, the  mixture of  $0.069{\\mathrm{~g~}}{\\mathsf{P b B r}}_{2}$     $(99.999\\%$  , Aldrich) and   $5~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   ODE was reacted  with  $0.5~{\\mathsf{r n L}}$   of oleylamine (Acros,   $80–90\\%)$  ) and   $0.5~{\\mathsf{r n L}}$   of OA under   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$  condition at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $\\sf{l}~\\sf{h}$   and then   $0.4~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of Cs–oleate solution was  quickly injected. The reaction mixture was reacted at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\;\\;10\\;s$   and  then cooled by ice–water bath. After cooling down, the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs  were separated from solvent by cent ri fuga tion, and then re dispersed  in Hexan.   $50~\\mathrm{mg}$   of photo initiator (BASF, Irgacure 819) was dispersed  in methyl meth a cry late (MMA,   $5~\\mathsf{m L}$  , Aldrich,   $99\\%$  ). 1 mL of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$  perovskite NCs solution (concentration of CsPbX3 NCs of  $\\approx\\!0.1\\ \\mathrm{g\\mum^{-1}}$  )  was added to MMA/photo initiator mixture. The mixture was spin-coated  on glass substrate at 500 rpm for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$   and then dried on the hot plate at   $50~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 5 min. The polymerization took place under UV irradiation for \n\n  $\\mathsf{\\tau}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathsf{\\Sigma}\\mathsf{h}$   in a glovebox.  \n\nScintilla tor Material Characterization : Absorption and PL data of the \n\n  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   NCs were measured with a Shimadzu model UV 3600 plus  and RF-6000, TRPL characteristics were measured by a ChronosBH-ISS  technology measuring equipment, and X-ray dose rates were measured  with a multifunction meter (Magicmax Rad, Daol). The stated dose was  the entrance dose in air, measured in air at the surface of the sample.  Between cathode and anode in acceleration voltage of   $50~\\mathrm{kV}$   was used  to generate the  $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray photons. The air kinetic energy released per unit  mass is commonly used in medical applications to give a measurement  parameter for the dose exposed to a patient. This parameter was used to  calculate the patient dose. Therefore,   $\\mathsf{m G y}_{\\mathrm{air}}$   allowed a comparison with  any other medical detector.  \n\nImage Readout and Processing : Images from the   $1650\\times1246$   CMOS  backplane with Si-photodiode and  $20\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   pixel size were read by a readout  integrated circuit (IC). The signal at the input was simultaneously  integrated, amplified, low-pass filtered, and converted from analog to  digital with a 12 bit converter. Noise produced by the external readout  electronics detector panel was characterized by taking dark images  without and with sensor. To eliminate fixed detector noise, dark images  were subtracted. The mean value and the standard deviation were  calculated from a region of interest. The standard deviation presents the  electronic noise in numbers of electrons. X-ray image from objects were  offset compensated by subtracting a dark image and flat-field corrected  by calculating the gain factor of each pixel.
