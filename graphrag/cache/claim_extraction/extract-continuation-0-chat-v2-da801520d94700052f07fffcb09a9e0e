Figure 1 a–d shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of CsPbBr3 with different Yb3+ doping concentrations. The sizes gradually decreases from 8.7 to 6.9 nm induced by the substitution of Br by Cl element (Figure S1, Supporting Information). As revealed by TEM, the as-prepared CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 QDs demonstrate a cubic morphology with an average size of 7.7 nm (Figure 1e). After doping with Yb3+ with 7% molar ratio, the average size of QDs reduces to about 6.9 nm. Further codoping with Ge3+ (2%) or Er3+ (1.7%) leads the average size of QDs to decrease to 6.8 nm. This can be attributed to the lattice contraction of perovskite QDs due to larger Pb2+ (1.33 Å) was substituted by smaller rare earth ions (Yb3+ : 0.86 Å, Er3+ : 0.88Å, Ge3+ : 1.03 Å). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1i) show that all the QDs have the same cubic phase (PDF#54-0752), and the patterns gradually shift toward large angle side because of the introduction of Cl element. For the Υb3+ (7.1%), Er3+ (0.12%) codoped, Υb3+ (7.1%), Er3+ (1.7%) codoped, Yb3+ (7.1%), Ge3+ (2%) codoped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5, the patterns have a little shift of 0.19° toward large angel compared to the undoped QDs. Note that the crystal lin it y of RE-doped QDs becomes worse compared to the undoped QDs. As more RE ions are immersed into the CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 lattice, the framework of CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 is partially destroyed. The XPS survey spectrum (Figure 1j) shows the presence of Cs, Pb, Cl, Br, Yb, and Er elements, further indicating the existence of RE ions in the CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 QDs. According to previous literatures, RE3+ may replace the sites of Pb2+ in the CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 host. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images for the Yb3+-doped and undoped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 QDs are presented in Figure 1k. The inter planar distances of (110) plane for doped and undoped QDs are determined to be ≈3.98 and 4.01Å, respectively. The slight decrease of inter planar distance suggests further that the small contraction happens in the doped sample due to the smaller Υb3+ ions occupied the sites of larger Pb2+ ions. Figure 2 a shows the UV–vis absorption (left), visible (middle), and near-infrared (right) emission spectra of various CsPbBr3 and CsPbClxBr3·x : Yb3+ QDs. After the introduction of Cl and Yb elements in the CsPbBr3 host, the UV–vis absorption peak shifts toward blue due to the gradually increased bandgap from the original 2.49 eV to 2.88 eV (Figure S2, Supporting Information), resulting from the partial substitution of Br by Cl element.
