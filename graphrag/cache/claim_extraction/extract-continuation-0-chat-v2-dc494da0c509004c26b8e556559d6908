Results and Discussion  \n\nIn a typical reaction, cesium chloride, tin chloride, and bismuth  chloride were added to HCl aqueous solution in an autoclave. It  was heated at   $180~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\\textrm{h}$   to produce a saturated solution,  and then nucleation and growth of particles were induced while  it was slowly cooled down from   $180~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   to room temperature  for   $20\\textrm{h}$   (see the Experimental Section). The Bi  $/(\\mathrm{Sn+Bi})$   molar  ratios were chosen to be   $0\\%$  ,   $0.99\\%$  ,   $4.76\\%$  ,   $9.09\\%$  ,   $13.04\\%$  ,   $16.66\\%$  , and   $23.08\\%$  . The products were collected from the  precursor solution by filtration followed by methanol and acetonitrile rinse for three times. We believe this thorough wash  was enough to remove the surface-adsorbed Bi ions, and the  detected bismuth discussed in the following parts should exist  as bismuth dopant in our products. Surprisingly, the products using stoic hio metric   $\\mathrm{{dnCl}_{4}}$   as precursors (molar ratio   $\\mathrm{nCl_{4}};\\mathrm{CsCl}=1{:}2\\rangle$  ) failed to show any luminescence. Instead, the  products using stoic hio metric   $\\mathrm{5nCl_{2}}$   precursors showed strong  photo luminescence; the difference between the selection of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   in the reagents will be discussed and explained  by theoretical calculations. Note that the products studied in  this work are all based on   $\\mathrm{5nCl_{2}}$   precursors.  \n\nIn the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1b) of the  as-collected powders, all the diffraction peaks are attributed to  − the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   crystal structure with the F m    $\\overline{{3}}m$   space group,  and no impurity phases were detected, on account of their  good consistency with the simulated XRD pattern for   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$    at bottom (ICSD #9023). It is noted that the diffraction peaks  show fairly small deviations, with the corresponding lattice  constant increases within   $0.031\\%$  for all the doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$    (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). This observation is somewhat surprising and the underlying reason will  be explained in the calculation part. We then measured the  chemical compositions of these powders by inductively coupled  plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). For the seed  Bi concentrations (i.e., the Bi/  $(\\mathrm{Sn+Bi})$   molar ratio) being   $0.99\\%$  ,   $4.76\\%$  ,   $9.09\\%$  ,   $13.04\\%$  ,   $16.66\\%$  , and   $23.08\\%$  , the ICP-OES– determined Bi concentrations are   $0.11\\%$  ,   $1.16\\%$  ,   $2.75\\%$  ,   $3.39\\%$  ,   $4.18\\%$  , and   $6.63\\%$  , respectively, indicating that the feeding Bi  precursor was only partially incorporated into the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi  products. From the XRD and ICP-OES results, we speculate  that Bi was incorporated in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   crystals successfully,  which will be supported further by   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$  -related photo lu minescence (PL) as will be discussed later on. Hereafter, we denote  the samples as   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6};x\\mathrm{Bi}$   using the ICP-OES-determined Bi  concentration   $_x$  .  \n\nWe further conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy  (XPS) measurements to determine the oxidation states of Bi  and Sn, which are important to understand the op to electronic  properties, as will be discussed later. The peaks (Figure 1c and  Figure S1 (Supporting Information)) located at 487.67 and   $496.07\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   correspond to   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}\\,3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   and   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$  , respectively, while  those located at 164.63 and   $159.26~\\mathrm{eV}$   are attributed to   $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}\\,4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2}$  and   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$  , respectively, guaranteeing the   $+4$   and   $+3$   oxidation  states for Sn and Bi, respectively.  \n\nHybrid lead halide per ovsk ites generally suffer from rather  poor thermodynamic stability with low decomposition temperatures. Here, thermo grav i metric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were carried out for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi powder samples (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The thermal decomposition of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi starts at   ${\\approx}370\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (the extrapolated onset temperature is
