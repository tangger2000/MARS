To date, although some per ovsk ites have demonstrated redox r ever sibi lit y with exsolution and dissolution of  metal nanoparticles in reducing and oxidizing atmosphere,   fundamental understanding of these phenomena is still  scarce.  \n\nEx situ scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/ TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques have been  employed to investigate the morphology and crystalline evolution after reducing and oxidizing treatments.  Irvine et  al.  found that a decrease in the stoic hio me try of perovskite  from   $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{B}\\,=\\,1$   to   $_\\mathrm{A/B<}1$   could break the bottleneck of exsolution level and facilitate high-population exsolution of metal  nanoparticles.  Kim et al. investigated the red uci bil it y of different cations in perovskite using co-segregation energy as  a descriptor. The co-segregation energy of B-site dopant and  oxygen vacancies plays a critical role in the exsolution.  Furthermore, Luo et al. used in situ TEM to investigate the exsolution of Co nano­particles in  $\\mathrm{Pr}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Ba}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.9}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.1}\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ (PBMCo) perovskite, excluding the possibility of metal nanoparticles  re-oxidation and structure evolution.  In situ crystal reconstruction is verified to be the triggering force driving the fast  growth of Co nanoparticles in PBMCo. To date, A-site deficiency  and crystal reconstruction are considered to facilitate the exsolution process of metal nanoparticles in perovskite. The exsolu- tion of single metal nanoparticles with low segregation energy  has been investigated intensively, but there are few reports on  the understanding of exsolution process and triggering force  of metal alloy nanoparticles with different segregation energies. The dissolution process and structural evolution under  oxidizing atmosphere also deserve more detailed research to  get fundamental understanding of redox r ever sibi lit y in order to  design highly efficient and regenerative metal-oxide interfaces  for  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis in SOECs.  \n\nHerein, we use in situ scanning transmission electron  microscopy (STEM), environmental scanning electron micro­ scopy (ESEM), XRD, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the exsolution and dissolution of CoFe  alloy nanoparticles in   $\\mathrm{Sr}_{2}\\mathrm{Fe}_{1.35}\\mathrm{Mo}_{0.45}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.2}\\mathrm{O}_{6-\\delta}$  (SFMC) double  perovskite. Under reducing atmosphere, the facile exsolution  of metallic Co promotes the reduction of Fe cation to generate  CoFe alloy nanoparticles in SFMC, accompanying with the  structure transformation from double perovskite to layered  perovskite. Under oxidizing atmosphere, the spherical CoFe  alloy nanoparticles are firstly oxidized to flat  $\\mathrm{CoFeO}_{x}$   nanosheet,  and then dissolved into the bulk accompanying with structure transformation from layered perovskite back to double  perovskite. After reduction, metal-oxide interfaces between the  exsolved CoFe alloy nanoparticles and SFMC substrate with  oxygen vacancies are constructed. The cathode with metal-oxide  interfaces shows a maximum current density of   $1.2\\;\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   for   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis, which is much higher than the parent SFMC  cathode   $(0.80\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  . No obvious performance degradation  is observed in a course of   $230\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$   and the performance can be  retrieved after 12 redox cycles due to the renew ability of CoFe  alloy nano pr tic les, suggesting a desirable cathode for   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis. DFT calculations indicate that the enhanced activity  derives from the synergetic effect between CoFe alloy nano­ particles and SFMC perovskite with oxygen vacancies.  \n\nSFMC powder was synthesized with a modified sol–gel  process.
