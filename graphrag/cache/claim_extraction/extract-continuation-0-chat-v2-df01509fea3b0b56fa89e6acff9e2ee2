Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

FigureÂ   $^{4\\dag}$   shows that perovskite films based on RbFtreated   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   have a stronger steady-state PL intensity (the light  is incident from the perovskite side), which demonstrates that  the corresponding perovskite films are of high quality. In addition, PL peaks shift to a shorter wavelength after surface treatment, indicating that the perovskite films with RbF modification have fewer defects. Figure  $4c$   displays the time-resolved PL  (TRPL) spectra fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, and  the corresponding fitted data are listed in TableÂ S5, Supporting  Information. As we all know, the fast decay   $(\\tau_{1})$   is ascribed to  the quenching of carriers at the ETL/perovskite interface, while  the slow decay   $(\\tau_{2})$   is in response to the radiative recombination of charge carriers because of the defects in perovskite  films.  Compared with the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2.}$  /perovskite film (  $\\tau_{1}=87.2$  .2Â ns,   $\\tau_{2}=177.85\\mathrm{~n~}$  .85Â ns), shorter   $\\tau_{1}$  is acquired for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF/perovskite   $(42.68~\\mathrm{ns})$  ), indicating a more effective electron extraction  from perovskite to   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . Meanwhile the longer   $\\tau_{2}$   is observed  for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}/}}$  perovskite (268.60Â ns), which demonstrates  the improved quality and decreased traps/defects density in the  perovskite. This is in accordance with the PL results.  \n\nThen we fabricated the perovskite solar cells with the structure of ITO/  $\\mathrm{{'}S n O_{2/}}$  perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, and  Figure   5 a  displays the cross-sectional SEM image of the device.

The equivalent circuit diagram is shown in FigureÂ S13, Supporting Information. Generally, the high-frequency component symbolizes  the charge transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{tr}})$  , and the low-frequency  one signifies the recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$  .  The corresponding fitting parameters are listed in TableÂ S6, Supporting  Information. As shown in FigureÂ  S14, Supporting Information, for the device based on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF, the smaller value  of   $R_{\\mathrm{tr}}$   demonstrates the enhanced electron transport at the ETL/ perovskite interface, simultaneously the larger  $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   of the  $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2}/$  RbF-based device indicates the depressed charge carrier recombination in the bulk perovskite. According to the IS, the charge  dynamics are in good agreement with that from the TRPL.  \n\nThe   $J{-}V$   characteristic curves of PSCs based on different  ETLs and the corresponding device parameters including   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$  ,   ${\\cal J}_{\\mathrm{sc}},$   fill factor (FF) as well as PCE are also listed in FigureÂ 5b.  The control device   $\\mathrm{\\{SnO_{2}}}$   based PSC) gives a PCE of   $19.78\\%$  ,  with the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.121Â V,  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $23.10\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , and FF of   $76.37\\%$  .  The   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF based device shows a greatly improved   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$    from 23.10 to   $23.86~\\mathrm{mA~cm}^{-2}$  , which is probably attributed to  the increased conductivity and electron mobility of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  - RbF together with the improved electron extraction ability at  the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2i}$  /perovskite interface.  As for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   based  PSC, the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   is promoted from 1.121 to   $1.156~\\mathrm{V},$   which may be  ascribed to the decreased defects/traps density as well as the  suppressed charge recombination proved by the TRPL and IS  measurements. In order to find out whether the Rb ion or F  ion contributes to the increase in the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   we spin-coated RbI  and RbCl instead of RbF on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   surface to explore the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of corresponding devices, respectively. As expected, the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$    increased from 1.132 to 1.157Â V and   $1.165\\mathrm{~V~}$   after the RbI and  RbCl treatment, respectively (FigureÂ S17, Supporting Information), which suggests that the  $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   cations can effectively inhibit  non-radiative recombination at the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}/$  per ovsk ites interface  and further enhance the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  . Another important parameter FF  of all the devices is almost the same, which may be due to that  the RbF has little effects on the quality of the perovskite films.  External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were operated to  evaluate the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  of PSCs. FigureÂ S18, Supporting Information,  shows that the integrated currents of the PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RbF, and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   are 22.51, 23.01, and   $22.64\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,  respectively, which are close to the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   from the   $J{-}V$  curves  despite the small deviations.  \n\nIn addition, the   $J{-}V$   curves of the champion devices based  on different ETLs under both reverse- and forward-scan directions are shown in FigureÂ  5c, and it is worth noting that the  hysteresis was greatly suppressed after RbF doping. What's  more interesting is that the hysteresis was further suppressed  when the RbF was spin-coated on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   surface. The hysteresis is normally attributed to the charge accumulation at the  interface, which mainly originates from ion migration, interfacial defects, and unbalanced charge transport between the ETL  side and HTL side within the PSCs.  The   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   incorporation  into the perovskite films can effectively inhibit the ions migration by occupying the interstitial sites in the bulk perovsk\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Output\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
