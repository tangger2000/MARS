Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Under a cut-off  voltage and based on a inter cal ation mechanism, the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   anode displays  the most favorable   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  storage properties  including both the rate and cycling performance. By means of the kinetics and quantitative analysis, a surface-dominated   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$    storage process is obviously improved by  the rational design of the   ${\\mathrm{MoS}}_{2}$   nanosheets,  thus providing a conclusive evidence of the  considerable charge storage at high rate.  In addition, the more accessible   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  diffusion and storage on the surface compared to  inter layers of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   are further confirmed by  the DFT calculations. In one word, the findings and completions achieved in this work  are promising for developing electordes with  high sodium-storage performance toward  next-generation energy-related applications.  \n\nand double   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   layers are calculated to be 0.98 and   $1.34~\\mathrm{eV},$    respectively, indicating that Na ions diffuse more readily on the   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   surface compared to the interspace between  $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   layers.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available online from the Wiley Online Library  or from the author.  \n\nThe experimental and calculation results present that  the   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   composite possesses a superior sodiumstorage capability among the three   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NO}$   samples as  well as compared to many other insertion-type anode materials. As illustrated in  Figure   6 , the enhanced electrochemical  behavior of   $\\mathrm{US}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}@\\mathrm{NG}$   can be ascribed to four points:  (i) the ultrathin   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets can effectively shorten the  transport path and lower the energy barriers of   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  diffusion; (ii)   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nanosheets with decreased size is capable of  providing more active sites for   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   adsorption and reaction;  (iii) the expanded inter layers of   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   are able to reduce the  resistance of charge transfer, thus improving the intercalation/extraction of   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   during the discharge/charge processes;  (iv) the hierarchical N-doped graphene can not only strengthen  the structure stability but also increase the electrical conductivity of the whole composites.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was mainly supported by MoE Tier 1 (RG22/16).
