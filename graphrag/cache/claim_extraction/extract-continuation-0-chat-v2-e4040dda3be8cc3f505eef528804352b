Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

A uniform perovskite  layer with full coverage, smooth top surface and enough thickness is essential  to ensure sufficient light harvesting and  decrease the shunting loss. On the other  hand, high-quality perovskite crystal lization can provide high-speed charge-trans- port channels with reduced recombination  loss. Thus many deposition procedures  have been developed, including one-step  spin-coating,  two-step sequential deposition,  vacuum co-evaporation,   anti solvent dripping,  vacuum-assisted  solution processing,  doctor blading,   soft-cover deposition,  etc. These deposition protocols can either modulate the film  morphology, or enhance the crystalline  quality. However, simultaneously control  \n\nSolution-processed perovskite (PSC) solar cells have achieved extremely  high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over   $\\mathbf{20\\%}$  , but practical application of this photovoltaic technology requires further advancements on both  long-term stability and large-area device demonstration. Here, an additiveengineering strategy is developed to realize a facile and convenient fabrication method of large-area uniform perovskite films composed of large crystal  size and low density of defects. The high crystalline quality of the perovskite  is found to simultaneously enhance the PCE and the durability of PSCs. By  using the simple and widely used methyl ammonium lead iodide   $(\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3})$  ,  a certified PCE of   $\\mathbf{19.19\\%}$   is achieved for devices with an aperture area of   $1.025\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{2}$  , and the high-performing devices can sustain over  $\\mathbf{80\\%}$   of the  initial PCE after  $\\mathbf{500\\,h}$   of thermal aging at  $\\mathbf{85\\,^{\\circ}C}$  , which are among the best  results of MAPb  $|_{3}$  -based PSCs so far.  \n\nHybrid organic–inorganic metal halide per ovsk ites, which have  excellent op to electronic properties, can be prepared and processed from solution, which makes them attractive for low-cost  photovoltaic applications.  Solar cells employing per ovsk ites as  absorber have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs)  over  $20\\%$  ,  which is commensurate with that of commercialized poly crystalline-silicon solar cells as well as the other inorganic thin-film solar cells based on   $\\mathrm{Cu}(\\mathrm{In},\\mathrm{Ga})\\mathrm{Se}_{2}$   and CdTe.   However, practical applications of perovskite-based photovoltaic  technology require further advancements on both long-term  durability and large-area device demonstration. Numerous previous studies have revealed that the film morphology and crystalline quality of the per ovsk ites are particularly important to  \n\nling the film morphology and crystalline quality still has proved  to be challenging, especially for fabricating large-size devices  via solution method. Moreover, the impact of per ovsk ites’ crystall iz ation quality on their device stability is largely unexplored  in previous studies.  \n\nThe one-step spin-coating procedure represents the simplest  solution process, in which stoic hio metric organic and metal  halide precursors are mixed in an organic solvent and transformed into perovskite (or intermediate) crystalline thin films  by centrifugal force and solvent evaporation. Such a simple  deposition route has cost advantages and potential of device  scaling up, but the crystal growth in this procedure is largely  uncontrollable, usually resulting in uneven films with many  uncovered areas and high surface roughness. Based on the  classic crystallization theory, a method of employing functional  additive into the precursor solution might be a viable way to  modulate the crystallization dynamics as well as to change the  overall film morphology.  Indeed, several types of chemical  additives, such as organic molecules,  inorganic or ammonium salts,  polymers,  ionic liquids,  etc., have been  previously attempted in the precursor formulation to improve  the perovskite film quality. Different additives may have different functional mechanisms, such as providing homogenous  nucleation sites to improve uniformity, coordinating with metal  ions to decrease the crystallization rate and enlarge crystals, and  changing the surface energy to control the crystal growth directions. Compared to vacuum or anti solvent dripping techniques,  the additive strategy does not increase the complexity of the  film deposition procedure. Although the application of some  additives have indeed improved the film quality as well as solar  cells performance when compared the control samples without  using additives, their PCEs are still much lower than those of  state-of-the-art devices using anti solvent dripping technique. This might be attributed to a fact that all previous studies only  focused on one type of additive in each work, which could not  meet the multiple demands, including morphological and crystall iz ation properties, for realizing superhigh-performance perovskite thin films.  \n\nThe research purpose of this work is to explore a route to  control and improve perovskite crystallization by using chemical additives, for seeking of convenient solution-phase fabrication of high-quality perovskite thin films with uniform mor- phology, large crystal size, and low trap density. We propose  an additive engineering strategy that modulates the film morphology and crystalline quality by using an ionic-liquid additive  of methyl ammonium acetate (MAAc) and a molecular additive of thio-semi carb azide (TSC), respectively ( Figure   1 a). The  introduction of   $10{-}15\\%$   MAAc (molar ratio) in a stoic hio metric  precursor solution is capable of generating highly uniform perovskite films with full coverage morphology through a simple  one-step spin-coating process, and a tiny amount (  $3{-}5\\%$   molar  ratio) addition of TSC is found to efficiently increase the perovskite crystal size. Their combination enables convenient  fabrication of uniform perovskite films with large crystals, low  density of defects, and ultra smooth surface over inch-sized  planar substrates. The high crystalline quality of perovskite is  found to simultaneously enhance the PCE and durability of  PSCs. By using the simple and widely used methyl ammonium  lead iodide   $\\left(\\operatorname{MAPbI}_{3}\\right)$  , a certified PCE of   $19.19\\%$   is achieved for  devices with an aperture area of   $1.025~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  , and the high-performing devices can remain over   $80\\%$   of the initial PCE after   $1000{\\mathrm{~h~}}$   of light soaking or   $500\\textrm{h}$   of thermal aging at   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . To  the best of our knowledge, both of the reported photovoltaic  performance and thermal stability in this study are among the  best results of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  -based PSCs so far.  \n\nEmploying chemical additives as morphology controllers  that improve the film uniformity of perovskite in one-step solution procedure (Figure 1b) have been widely explored by many  other groups, and several functional mechanisms depending  on the type of the additives were proposed.  Ionic-liquid  materials, such as 1-hexyl-3-methyl i mid a zo liu m chloride,   have been identified as a good choice of morphology controlling additives. The reason is that they can remain in the spincoated films after solvent evaporation, which efficiently retards  the disordered crystal growth and provide homogenous nucleation sites, resulting in controlled arrangement of perovskite  crystals and homogeneous film morphology. However, previous ionic-liquid additives were mostly composed of long alkyl  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/d62e2331a0ab832ea7daeb55092cde5eb60e00f9bafd1aea3215f471f260f4a9-1723832484.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Additive-assisted film fabrication and characterization. a) Additive engineering by combining an ionic additive of MAAc and a molecular  additive of TSC in stoic hio metric  ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  -MAI precursor solution with DMF as solvent.
