Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

As shown in Figure S12a, (Supporting Information) undoped and   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   singly doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   only exhibit  intense absorption below   $350~\\mathrm{nm}$  , whereas the   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   doped and   $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   show a new absorption peak at   $370~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  . This new absorption comes from the contribution of  the   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   dopants as discussed above. A similar phenomenon  is observed in PLE spectra ( Figure    4 a). Monitoring the NIR  emission at  $994~\\mathrm{nm}$  , the   $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   shows  an additional excitation at   $370~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  , which is different from the  excitation of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  , but consistent with the  excitation of   $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$   doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  . These indicate both STEs  and NIR emissions originate from the same excited state and  ET process from STEs to   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions exists.  \n\nThe ET channel from STE to   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions can be further  proved by measuring the PL decay dynamics of STE emissions  in   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$  : Sb,   $\\mathrm{x\\%Yb}$     $\\mathrm{(x=0-}2.78)$  ) samples, as shown in  Figure  4b. Through the double-exponential fitting for the PL  decay curves, the effective lifetime of STE emission of each  sample is obtained and depicted in Figure 4c. The ET efficiency   $(\\eta_{\\mathrm{ET}})$   from STEs to  $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   can be calculated based on Equation (1):  \n\n$$\n\\eta_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathrm{FT}}=1-\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{\\scriptscriptstyle0}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\tau$  and   $\\tau_{0}$   are the corresponding lifetimes of STE emission in the presence and absence of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  , respectively. As can  be seen, the ET efficiency from STE to   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions gradually rises  along with the increase of the   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   content and reaches above   $30\\%$   at   $2.78\\%~\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   doping. The highly efficient ET efficiency  may be ascribed to two main reasons: on the one hand,   $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$    and  $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions both occupy the   $\\operatorname{In}^{3+}$   sites in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   host,  leading to a short distance between the   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   sensitizer and   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$    activator which is conducive to the occurrence probability of ET  process. On the other hand, a relatively large overlap between  STE emission and   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   absorption profile (Figure S12b, Supporting Information) and a slight relaxation will facilitate the  transfer of energy from STE to   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  . The schematic diagram of  the ET process is proposed in Figure 4d. Sb-doping decreases  the excitation energy to   $350{-}450\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . Upon the excitation at   $350{-}450\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , the electrons are excited from the 5s state to 5p  state of   $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$   ions. Then the excited electrons are trapped in   $[\\mathrm{degCl}_{6}]^{5-}$   octahedral through no-radiative relaxation, forming  STEs which are responsible for the broadband red emission. Simultaneously, partial STEs effectively transfer their  energy to   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions, yielding a NIR emission at   $994~\\mathrm{nm}$   from   $^2\\mathrm{F}_{5/2}{\\rightarrow}^{2}\\mathrm{F}_{7/2}$   transition of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions. Additionally, we found that  the red emission of STE in  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6}{:\\mathrm{Sh}^{3+}}/\\mathrm{Y}\\mathrm{b}^{3+}$  decreases significantly with the increase of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   concentration while its PL  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/ff6761c19d727ded29b7b2a2af6d0d8f3c84ec4d7726c2fe072dc9c11f6089f1-1727105142.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   a) PLE spectra of   ${\\sf Y b}^{3+}$   doped,   ${\\mathsf{S}}{\\mathsf{b}}^{3+}$   doped, and   $\\mathsf{S b}^{3+}{\\cdot}\\mathsf{Y b}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g}\\mathsf{I n C I}_{6}$  . b) PL decay curves of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g l n C l}_{6}$  : Sb,   $x\\%\\Upsilon b$  .   $(x=0–2.78$  ,   $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{ex}}=370~\\mathsf{n m}$  ;   $\\lambda_{\\mathsf{e m}}=660\\ \\mathsf{n m})$  ). c) Lifetime of STEs and ET efficiency from STEs to   ${\\sf Y b}^{3+}$   as a function of   ${\\sf Y b}^{3+}$   concentration. d) Schematic diagram of  energy level and ET processes in  $\\mathsf{S b}^{\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The text provided does not contain any claims or facts relevant to the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event) or the claim description.
