After   $500\\,\\textrm{h}$  , the PSC passivated  by tBBAI interlayer retained   $95\\%$   of its initial efficiency, in  contrast to   $84\\%$   for the PSC with PEAI interlayer and   $70\\%$  for the non pas siva ted PSC. The major contribution to the  efficiency decline observed for the latter PSCs arise stems  from a decrease in FF   $({\\approx}87\\%$   compared to initial value), The  reason for this is likely that the PEAI interlayer or the direct  contact between perovskite and HTL does not form a stable  interface as contrast to tBBAI. Contact angle measurements  of water droplets on the surface of perovskite films with and  without inter facial layers are shown in Figure  6B. The bare  perovskite film, perovskite film with PEAI, and tBBAI surface  treatments exhibit contact angles with a water droplet of   $54^{\\circ}$  ,   $62^{\\circ}$  , and   $82^{\\circ}$  , respectively. Using Neumann’s equation,  we  calculated a surface free energy of   $32.9\\,\\mathrm{\\m},$  J   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   for tBBAIpassivated perovskite, which is substantially lower than   $50.2\\,\\mathrm{\\megam^{-2}}$   for pristine perovskite film, implying a better  moisture resistance for tBBAI-passivated per ovsk ites.  To  further prove this, PSCs with and without interface layers are  aged under ambient condition with an RH of   $50–70\\%$  , the  results are shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. It is observed that after 55 days   $(\\approx\\!1300\\mathrm{\\h})$  , the PSC with  tBBAI interlayer decreased by less than   $10\\%$  , while in comparison, PSC with PEAI decreases by   $16\\%$   and PSCs without  interface layer decreased by over   $26\\%$  . This larger performance decrease implies a faster degradation of the perovskite  films due to increased moisture uptake.  \n\nIn conclusion, a new surface pass iv ation agent, tBBAI was  developed. Electro-optical characterizations show that tBBAIpassivated perovskite films exhibit less non radiative charge  carrier recombination, i.e., a lower defect density, and a significantly improved charge extraction from the perovskite  film to the HTL. We observe a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   increase of   ${\\approx}20\\ \\mathrm{mV}$   with  tBBAI compared to PEAI, and   ${\\approx}50\\ \\mathrm{\\mV}$   compared to the  perovskite films without pass iv ation. Our tBBAI champion  cell yielded PCE of   $23.5\\%$  , which is among the highest PSC  efficiencies achieved so far. In addition, the enhanced hydrophobicity of tBBAI compared to PEAI leads to an enhanced  moisture resistivity, and thus better operational stability.  PSCs with tBBAI retained over   $95\\%$   of their initial PCE after   $500\\textrm{h}$   MPP tracking, and over   $90\\%$   of their initial PCE after  55 days ageing under ambient air with an RH of   $50–70\\%$  . Our  work provides a simple yet effective approach to fabricate efficient PSCs with outstanding efficiency and high operational  stability.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/5e51289d0b4eb18cfda3fc500b1086e100a1664899347694dc89902a81c60f11-1723835224.jpg)  \nFigure 6.  $(\\mathsf{N}_{2})$   and under 1  sun continuous illumination of a PSC without pass iv ation and PSCs passivated with PEAI and tBBAI.
