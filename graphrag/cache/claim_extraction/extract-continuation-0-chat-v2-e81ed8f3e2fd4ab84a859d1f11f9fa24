{"result": "## (BAP<|>PEROVSKITE FILMS<|>SYNTHESIS ROLE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>BAP serves as a modifier in the synthesis of perovskite films. It is incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution and influences the crystalline, morphological, and photophysical properties of the resulting films. The addition of BAP leads to improved crystallization, reduced film surface roughness, and enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield. The interaction between BAP and the perovskite structure is confirmed by the shifts in FTIR and XPS spectra.<|>Based on the above findings, we further investigate the influence of BAP-modification on the crystalline, morphological, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pristine and BAP-modified perovskite films are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). It’s observed that both the perovskite films present apparent diffraction peaks at 15.1°, 21.5°, and 30.7°, corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) crystal facets in cubic crystal. The identical diffraction peak locations indicate that both 8A- and K+ can not occupy the perovskite lattice sites. By comparison, the incorporation of BAP-modification only leads to slightly reduced diffraction intensities. As displayed in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), adding BAP into perovskite precursor solution does not change its contact angle on the normal hole transport layers applied in our work. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to examine the morphological transition of perovskite films (Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information). It is noted that the BAP-modification induces an obvious influence on the film surface roughness, by which the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) roughness is decreased from 2.2 to 0.3 nm. Besides, the SEM images demonstrate that the pristine perovskite film is assembled by nonuniform crystals with low film coverage, while the BAP-modified film presents compact grains without pinholes. The distinct film morphology not only confirms the ability of BAP in improving perovskite crystallization, but also validates the interaction between BAP and CsPb(Br/Cl)3 perovskite from another side.)\n##\n(BAP<|>PEROVSKITE FILMS<|>MATERIAL PROPERTY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The addition of BAP to perovskite films results in improved photophysical properties. Specifically, BAP-modification significantly boosts the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of perovskite films. The increase in PL intensity is attributed to the suppression of trap-mediated non-radiative recombination loss, as evidenced by the increase in the average lifetime of excitons from 14.6 to 21.0 ns. Consequently, a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) improvement of perovskite films from 35.2% to 72.1% was achieved with BAP-modification.<|>To gain insights into the photophysical impact of BAP-modification on perovskite films, we firstly collected the UV–vis absorption curves as plotted in Figure 2a. Evidently, both pristine and BAP-modified perovskite films show almost the same absorption characteristic, demonstrating that doping BAP does not vary the RD phase distribution in perovskite films. It’s noted that there are no observable absorption peaks from low-n phases (n<3), where n refers to the number of layers in RD perovskite structures. Such phenomenon can be attributed to the moderate concentration of organic spacer in perovskite precursor. The concentrated n-phase distribution (n≥3) is favorable for achieving efficient radiative recombination and minimized exciton energy loss. The Tauc plot analysis depicted by the inset in Figure 2a shows the negligible change in the optical bandgap of perovskite film. As displayed in Figure 2b, BAP-modification significantly boosts the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of perovskite film, which can be also visually confirmed by the photograph in the inset. The slight variation in the PL peak positions keeps well consistent with the UV–vis absorption spectra. To elucidate the immediate factor of the PL enhancement by BAP-modification, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement was conducted to study the exciton dynamics in perovskite films (Figure 2c). The TRPL curves were fitted by means of tri-exponential decay functions, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The increase of the calculated average lifetime (τavg) from 14.6 to 21.0 ns enabled by BAP-modification demonstrates the suppression of the trap-mediated non-radiative recombination loss. Consequently, a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) improvement of perovskite films from 35.2% to 72.1% was achieved with BAP-modification as shown in the inset of Figure 2c.)\n##\n(BAP<|>PEROVSKITE FILMS<|>CHARACTERIZATION METHOD<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The interaction between BAP and perovskite films is characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The FTIR measurement shows shifts in the vibrational bands of COO- groups upon mixing with PbBr2, indicating a coordinating interaction between Pb cations and 8A- anions through the CO- groups. The XPS measurement reveals shifts in the core levels of Pb 4f and halide ions, providing direct evidence for the interaction between K+ and halide ions.<|>To prove the interaction between 8A- group and CsPb(Br/Cl)3 perovskite, we firstly conducted the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement as shown in Figure 1d. For pure BAP sample, the vibrational bands of COO- groups are located around 1597 and 1549 cm-1, while they shift to lower wave numbers of 1592 and 1527 cm-1 upon mixing with PbBr2. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on pristine and BAP-modified perovskite films. In comparison, the XPS spectra from the core levels of Pb 4f shifts to higher binding energy with the modification of BAP (Figure 1e). The simultaneous shifts in FTIR and XPS spectra synergistically can be attributed to the coordinating interaction between Pb cations and 8A- anions through the CO- groups sharing a lone electron pair with the empty 6p orbital of under coordinated Pb atoms. Apart from that, an apparent XPS spectral shift is also observed for the core levels of Br 3d and Cl 2p, which provides the direct evidence for the interaction between K+ and halide ions (Figure 1f).)\n##\n(BAP<|>PEROVSKITE FILMS<|>PERFORMANCE METRIC<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The BAP-modification of perovskite films leads to a significant improvement in the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).

In comparison, the XPS  spectra from the core levels of Pb 4f shifts to higher binding  energy with the modification of BAP (Figure  1e).

The  X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pristine and BAPmodified perovskite films are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting  Information). It’s observed that both the perovskite films  present apparent diffraction peaks at   $15.1^{\\circ},\\ 21.5^{\\circ}$  , and   $30.7^{\\circ}$  ,  corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) crystal facets in  cubic crystal. The identical diffraction peak locations indicate  that both   $\\mathrm{8A^{-}}$   and   $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$   can not occupy the perovskite lattice  sites. By comparison, the incorporation of BAP-modification  only leads to slightly reduced diffraction intensities. As displayed in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), adding BAP  into perovskite precursor solution does not change its contact angle on the normal hole transport layers applied in our  work. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force  microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to examine  the morphological transition of perovskite films (Figures S3  and S4, Supporting Information).

It is incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution and influences the crystalline, morphological, and photophysical properties of the resulting films. The addition of BAP leads to improved crystallization, reduced film surface roughness, and enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield. The interaction between BAP and the perovskite structure is confirmed by the shifts in FTIR and XPS spectra.<|>Based on the above findings, we further investigate the influence of BAP-modification on the crystalline, morphological, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pristine and BAP-modified perovskite films are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). It’s observed that both the perovskite films present apparent diffraction peaks at 15.1°, 21.5°, and 30.7°, corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) crystal facets in cubic crystal. The identical diffraction peak locations indicate that both 8A- and K+ can not occupy the perovskite lattice sites. By comparison, the incorporation of BAP-modification only leads to slightly reduced diffraction intensities. As displayed in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), adding BAP into perovskite precursor solution does not change its contact angle on the normal hole transport layers applied in our work. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to examine the morphological transition of perovskite films (Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information). It is noted that the BAP-modification induces an obvious influence on the film surface roughness, by which the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) roughness is decreased from 2.2 to 0.3 nm. Besides, the SEM images demonstrate that the pristine perovskite film is assembled by nonuniform crystals with low film coverage, while the BAP-modified film presents compact grains without pinholes. The distinct film morphology not only confirms the ability of BAP in improving perovskite crystallization, but also validates the interaction between BAP and CsPb(Br/Cl)3 perovskite from another side.)\n##\n(BAP<|>PEROVSKITE FILMS<|>MATERIAL PROPERTY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The addition of BAP to perovskite films results in improved photophysical properties. Specifically, BAP-modification significantly boosts the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of perovskite films. The increase in PL intensity is attributed to the suppression of trap-mediated non-radiative recombination loss, as evidenced by the increase in the average lifetime of excitons from 14.6 to 21.0 ns. Consequently, a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) improvement of perovskite films from 35.2% to 72.1% was achieved with BAP-modification.<|>To gain insights into the photophysical impact of BAP-modification on perovskite films, we firstly collected the UV–vis absorption curves as plotted in Figure 2a. Evidently, both pristine and BAP-modified perovskite films show almost the same absorption characteristic, demonstrating that doping BAP does not vary the RD phase distribution in perovskite films. It’s noted that there are no observable absorption peaks from low-n phases (n<3), where n refers to the number of layers in RD perovskite structures. Such phenomenon can be attributed to the moderate concentration of organic spacer in perovskite precursor. The concentrated n-phase distribution (n≥3) is favorable for achieving efficient radiative recombination and minimized exciton energy loss. The Tauc plot analysis depicted by the inset in Figure 2a shows the negligible change in the optical bandgap of perovskite film. As displayed in Figure 2b, BAP-modification significantly boosts the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of perovskite film, which can be also visually confirmed by the photograph in the inset. The slight variation in the PL peak positions keeps well consistent with the UV–vis absorption spectra. To elucidate the immediate factor of the PL enhancement by BAP-modification, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement was conducted to study the exciton dynamics in perovskite films (Figure 2c). The TRPL curves were fitted by means of tri-exponential decay functions, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The increase of the calculated average lifetime (τavg) from 14.6 to 21.0 ns enabled by BAP-modification demonstrates the suppression of the trap-mediated non-radiative recombination loss. Consequently, a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) improvement of perovskite films from 35.2% to 72.1% was achieved with BAP-modification as shown in the inset of Figure 2c.)\n##\n(BAP<|>PEROVSKITE FILMS<|>CHARACTERIZATION METHOD<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The interaction between BAP and perovskite films is characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The FTIR measurement shows shifts in the vibrational bands of COO- groups upon mixing with PbBr2, indicating a coordinating interaction between Pb cations and 8A- anions through the CO- groups. The XPS measurement reveals shifts in the core levels of Pb 4f and halide ions, providing direct evidence for the interaction between K+ and halide ions.<|>To prove the interaction between 8A- group and CsPb(Br/Cl)3 perovskite, we firstly conducted the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement as shown in Figure 1d. For pure BAP sample, the vibrational bands of COO- groups are located around 1597 and 1549 cm-1, while they shift to lower wave numbers of 1592 and 1527 cm-1 upon mixing with PbBr2. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on pristine and BAP-modified perovskite films. In comparison, the XPS spectra from the core levels of Pb 4f shifts to higher binding energy with the modification of BAP (Figure 1e). The simultaneous shifts in FTIR and XPS spectra synergistically can be attributed to the coordinating interaction between Pb cations and 8A- anions through the CO- groups sharing a lone electron pair with the empty 6p orbital of under coordinated Pb atoms. Apart from that, an apparent XPS spectral shift is also observed for the core levels of Br 3d and Cl 2p, which provides the direct evidence for the interaction between K+ and halide ions (Figure 1f).)\n##\n(BAP<|>PEROVSKITE FILMS<|>PERFORMANCE METRIC<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The BAP-modification of perovskite films leads to a significant improvement in the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).
