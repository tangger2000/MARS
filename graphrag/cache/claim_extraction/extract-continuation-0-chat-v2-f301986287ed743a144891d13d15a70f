Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Interestingly, the elastic  modulus of 3D perovskite is very close to that of human bones  and the elastic modulus of 2D perovskite with long chain is the  level of cartilage which is much softer than 3D perovskite.   This natural coincidence provides us a chance to construct a  cushion in the perovskite film with the function of “bone-joint”  \n\nconfigurations that can release external stresses. It is possible  that the stress relaxation may come from the similar CTEs of  layered perovskite with glass substrates. To exclude this, the  CTE of   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$     $(n=1)$   2D per ovsk ites was determined by temperature-dependent single crystal powder XRD (Figures S7 and  S8, Supporting Information). Further, we find the pure 2D layer  perovskite films fabricated on glass bear residual thermal stress  by comparing the XRD peak positions (Figure S9, Supporting  Information). The linear CTE of   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$   2D perovskite were  evaluated as  $\\mathrm{CTE\\_}a\\,{=}\\,4.857\\times10^{-5}\\:\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$  ,  $\\mathrm{CTE\\_}b\\,{=}\\,8.651\\times10^{-5}\\:\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$  ,   $\\mathrm{CTE\\_}c=19.11\\times10^{-5}\\;\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$  , and the bulk average CTE was evaluated as   $\\mathrm{CTE\\_AVE}=10.94\\times10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$  . This is on the same order  of magnitude as 3D counterparts, which is much larger than  that of glass.  Therefore, the stress relaxation of the 3D perovskite is inferred to be mainly related to the low Young’s modulus mechanical property of 2D per ovsk ites.  \n\nOrganic A-site cations incorporation is proven to effectively  tailor the inter facial interaction between structural subunits,  and the mechanisms for residual stress relaxation with   $\\mathrm{OA}/$  PEA treatment are illustrated in Figure 2e. Although both cations possess eight carbon atoms, OA is more flexible than PEA  that bears a stiff benzene ring. Due to the incorporation of large  organic cations, these 2D perovskite components mainly dwell  at the surface of the perovskite thin films to construct “soft”  structural subunits, which provides extra structural flexibility in  the spatial perspective against lattice distortion. It benefits to  retain the micro structure of the poly crystalline film to reduce  the residual stress during conventional annealing. Moreover,  the structural/stiffness difference of A-site cations is possible  to lead to the different crystal growth kinetics and/or thermodynamics: OA treatment is inclined to create quasi-2D perovskites with dominant   $n=3$   components, while PEA results in  per ovsk ites with prevailing components of   $n=1$  . Extending to  but yl ammonium iodine (BAI) and guan id in i um iodine (GuI),  the surface residual stresses (Figure S10 and Table S3, Supporting Information) and the corresponding PL (Figure S11,  Supporting Information) were measured. The results show  that the lattice reconstruction due to BAI treatment was successfully observed, but stress relaxation was not as effective as  PEAI or OAI. It is likely that the short alkyl chain is prone to  generate high   $n$  -value inorganic layers in the resultant layered  2D perovskite, which mainly determines the mechanical properties of the resultant perovskite.  Interestingly, there was no  significant formation of 2D perovskite on the top of 3D perovskite after GuI treatment, which results in even minor stress  relaxation mostly due to is the mechanical modality of the asformed 2D per ovsk ites on top. This tunable stiffness provides  us flexible choice to conduct the bone joint. Our results thus  suggest a strategy to tune the residual stress of hybrid halide  per ovsk ites by tuning different functional groups of A-site cations incorporated.  \n\nWe further evaluate the photovoltaic performance of devices  based on the residual stress reduced perovskite films. The  photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the   $\\mathrm{n{-}i{-}p}$   architecture  of glass/ITO/  $\\mathrm{{5nO_{2/}}}$  perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The devices  exhibit average PCE (and   $\\mathrm{PCE}_{\\operatorname*{max}})$   of   $18.47\\%$     $(20.02\\%)$   for the  references. Among all samples with residual stress relaxation,  OAI with concentration of   $10\\times10^{-3}$    m  achieved the best performance with the optimal average PCE (and   $\\mathrm{PCE}_{\\operatorname*{max}})$  ) is   $19.37\\%$   $(21.48\\%)$  . As illustrated in  Figure    3 a and Figure S12 in the  Supporting Information, the champion device (O-10) with PCE  of   $21.48\\%$   exhibited an open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$   of   $1.183\\,\\mathrm{~V},$    a short-circuit current   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$   of   $23.66~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , a fill factor of   $76.74\\%$  . The enhanced PCE mainly originates from improvements in the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and   $J_{S C}$  . The histogram of two batches of  cells shows the reproducibility and further verifies the PCE  enhancement (Figure 3b). The integrated current density from  the external quantum efficiency (EQE) matches the   $J_{S C}$   values  measured under AM 1.5G one sun illumination (Figure 3c).  \n\nThe significant improvement in   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   is likely attributed to the  improved carrier extraction and reduced non radiative recombination at the interface. We conducted the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test of complete devices to evaluate the  contact resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{co}}\\right)$   and recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$   at  the perovskite-contact interface (Figure 3d). The decreased   $R_{\\mathrm{co}}$  (from 13.4 to   $8.4~\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$  ) and increased   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   (from 732 to   $804~\\mathrm{k}\\Omega_{r}$  for the residual stress relaxed devices indicate that charge  transportation within the perovskite layer and contact resistance  at the perovskite-contact interface is indeed improved. Furthermore, the trap densities and charge mobilities were evaluated by  space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurement (Figure S13a,b,  Supporting Information). The trap density decreases from   $2.63~\\times~10^{16}$   to   $2.09~\\times~10^{16}~\\;\\mathrm{{cm}}^{-3}$  , along with the carrier  mobility increases from   $1.34\\times10^{-3}$   to   $8.32\\times10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  .  In addition, the time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL)  measurements were carried out (Figure S14 and Table S4, Supporting Information). The average decay time   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}}$   increases  from 28.0 to 76.4 ns for the residual stress relaxed perovskite  films, which decreases the structural disorders at grain interiors and/or boundaries, so the charge carried trapping was  suppressed and enhanced charge carrier lifetime. These results  are in line with the EIS and SCLC results, in line with recent  report showing that the microscopic stress of perovskite is  directly associated with enhanced defect concentrations and  non radiative recombination.  In our study, reducing residual  stress, in the macroscopic scale, can reduce defects, enhance  carrier mobility, and inhibit non radiative recombination, and  thus improves device efficiency.  \n\nThe operational parameters of devices with different treatments are summarized in Figure S15 and Table S5 in the Supporting Information. We observed the device efficiency exhibited  first increased and then decreased with the increasing concentration of either PEA or OA\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Output\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
