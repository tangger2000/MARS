Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n## Examples\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine\nClaim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis\nText: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles.

The heating and cooling rates were both   $2~^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}~{\\mathsf{m i n}}^{-1}$  . After calcination, the target products NiCo  $@$   N-C NFs were  obtained successfully.  \n\nPhysical Characterization : The morphology and structures of the  as-made materials were characterized by SEM(Hitachi SU8010) and  HRTEM (FEI, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin). XRD (UK, Bede Scientific Ltd.;  $\\mathsf{C u K}$  α  radiation; operated at  $40\\:|\\mathsf{k V},45\\:\\mathsf{m A}$  ;  $\\lambda\\,{=}\\,0.15418\\;\\mathsf{n m})$  ) was used to measure  the crystal structures of the prepared samples. The scanning range was  from   $40^{\\circ}$   to   $80^{\\circ}$   with a step rate of  $4^{\\circ}\\ m\\mathrm{{in}^{-1}}$  . TGA (SDT 2960) was used  to determine the optimum calcination temperature in order to obtain the  best morphology and structures and the loading mass of the alloy in the  composites. From the results of TGA (Figure S9, Supporting Information),  it was seen that   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   was high enough for the formations of alloys and  carbon iz ation the polymers. Raman spectrum analysis (Horiba Xplora  PLUS, with laser excitation at   $638\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m}$  sweep from 800 to   $2000\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-1}$  ,   $0.2\\ m\\mathbb{W}$   power) was adopted to distinguish the characteristic vibrational  modes of the synthesized materials, mainly for the D-band and G-band  of the samples. XPS (VG ESCALAB MKII) with a mono chroma ti zed Al   $\\mathsf{K}_{\\mathsf{a}}$   (1486 eV) source was used to analyze the binding environment of all  chemical elements in the synthesized materials.  \n\nElectrochemical Measurements : To measure the electrochemical  performances of the synthesized samples, the electrochemical  measurements were adopted by using a computer-controlled Pine  Electrochemical System (AFMSRX rotator, and AFCBP1 bi potenti ost at)  with the RDE technique. All the electrochemical measurements were  performed in a standard three-electrode cell, in which a glassy carbon  electrode was used as the working electrode (geometric area:  $0.196\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{2})$  ),  a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an   $\\mathsf{A g}/\\mathsf{A g C I}$   (filled with   $3\\,\\mathrm{\\textsc{m}}\\,{\\sf K C I}$    solution) electrode as the reference electrode. The catalyst ink was  made by weighing synthesized samples (  $(5~\\mathsf{m g}$  , without acetylene black)  to dissolve in a mixed solution that included Nafion solution   $(95~\\upmu L,$  ,   $5~\\mathrm{wt\\%}$   in ethanol, Aldrich) and ethanol   $(350~\\upmu L)$  , and then the mixture  was ultrasonic a ted for about   $30\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$   to get a homogenous solution.  After that, catalyst ink   $(7\\,\\upmu\\mathsf{L})$   was casted onto the surface of the working  electrode for further electrochemical measurements. The mass loading  of all the samples was   $0.4\\ m g\\ c m^{-2}$  . In order to compare the testing  results more conveniently, all the potential values were converted to  versus RHE.  \n\nThe EIS measurements were tested by an Electrochemical Workstation  (Autolab, PGSTAT302N) in   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$  -saturated KOH (0.1  m ) at a rotating speed  of 1600 rpm. During the EIS testing process, the AC amplitude applied  was   $5\\ m\\lor$   and the frequency ranged from   $50\\;\\mathsf{k}\\mathsf{H}\\mathsf{z}$   to   $10\\ \\mathsf{m H z}$  .  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation  of China (21673153, 21303114, 51272167, and 51572181), National  Key Research and Development Program of China (2016 Y FB 0100200),  Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of  Jiangsu Province, China (15 KJ B 480001), Natural Science Foundation of  Jiangsu Province, China (BK20161207), and China Postdoctoral Science  Foundation (2017 M 611894).
