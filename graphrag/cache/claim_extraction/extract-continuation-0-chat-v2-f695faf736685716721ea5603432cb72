Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Along with the  active area of the device, the specific detect iv it y   $(D^{*}\\!)$  , another  figure of merit of the photodetector which is related to the sensitivity that a detector can distinguish from the background noise  can be calculated based on the resp on siv it y and noise. Figure 1f  shows the   $D^{*}$   spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   devices. The  peak   $D^{*}$   of about   $9.7\\times10^{12}$   and   $6.0\\times10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{cm\\W^{-1}\\ H z^{1/2}}$   are  obtained at around 525 and   $515~\\mathrm{nm}$   for  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  devices, respectively, which are among the highest detect iv it y of  the reported perovskite photodetector s (Table 1).  \n\nPhoto response of the photodetector s under weak light is  studied using the lock-in amplifier. A   $450~\\mathrm{nm}$   LED modulated  with a   $35\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$   square wave is used as the light source. Neutral  density filters and a Si photodetector are used to adjust and  calibrate the light intensities.  Figure   2 a shows the photo current  spectra of the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   photodetector under dark and weak light  intensities from   $21.5\\ \\mathrm{pW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   to   $3.17\\;\\mathrm{nW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The currents of  the device under dark at different frequencies are about tens of  fA, which is close to the noise current of the devices shown in  Figure 1e. Sharp peaks at   $35~\\mathrm{Hz}$  , which is the modulation frequency of the incident light, can be found under light, indicating  the current peaks are the signals of photodetector responding  to the incident light. When the incident light intensity is about   $21.5\\ \\mathrm{pW}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , an obvious peak at   $35~\\mathrm{Hz}$   can be distinguished  from the noise floor (inset of Figure 2a), indicating the photo­ detector can detect the weak light as low as   $21.5\\ \\mathrm{pW}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The  current at   $35\\ \\mathrm{\\textrm{Hz}}$   increases linearly with the light intensities  when it increases from  $21.5\\;\\mathrm{pW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   to   $3.17\\;\\mathrm{nW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  .  \n\nThe linear response of a photodetector to the light intensity is a key figure of merit to a photodetector, especially for  use in light measurement and imaging applications. As we  show in Figure 2b,c, to determine the linear response range  of the photodetector, we adjust the incident light intensities from   $\\mathsf{p W}\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   to hundreds   $\\mathrm{mW~cm}^{-2}$   and measure the  photo current of the photodetector. The photo current of the  device based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   increases linearly from   $4.6\\times10^{-12}$   to   $4.7\\times10^{-2}$   A   $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   when the incident light intensities increase  from   $2.1\\times10^{-11}$   to   $0.23\\ \\mathrm{W}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The results indicate that the  device can keep linear response to the light intensity over about  10 orders of magnitude, corresponding to a linear dynamic  range (LDR) of about 200 dB, which is close to that of previous  reported perovskite photodetector s.  The external quantum  efficiency (EQE) of the photodetector is nearly constant   $(57.1\\%\\,\\pm\\,3.1\\%)$  ) within this light intensity range, which confirms the excellent linear response of the device. As shown in  Figure 2c, photodetector based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   also shows excellent  linear response and keeps a nearly constant EQE of   $52.8\\%\\pm$   $4.0\\%$   from   $\\mathtt{p W}\\ \\mathtt{c m}^{-2}$   to hundreds mW   $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , corresponding a  broad LDR of 194 dB.  \n\nWe characterize the response speed of the AIHP photodetector at 0 bias voltage with a pulsed laser and an oscilloscope.  \n\nTable 1.   Summary of performance of photodetector s based on hybrid perovskite and all-inorganic perovskite. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/87b01548e381f604de43e053a0b752f9ef17f31f9e0299d21135cee9236a6465-1723833485.jpg)  \n ${\\mathsf{a}})_{\\mathsf{S C}:}$  : single crystal; NW: nanowire; NS: nanosheet; CNT: carbon nanotube; NP: nanoplate; QD: quantum dot; MC: micro crystal.  \n\nFigure 2d,e shows the transient photo current (TPC) curves of  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   devices with different active areas  from 7.25 to around   $0.1~\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$  .
