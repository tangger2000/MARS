Through the modification of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM, the performance of PSCs based on the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM  is further improved. Although remarkable results have been  achieved, some issues are yet to be addressed, e.g., long-term  stability, and researches on the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM and the optimization  of PSCs based on the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM have to be carried on.  \n\nIn the last few years, the performance of PSCs has made great  progress. Many fabrication methods and new perovskite compounds have been developed to fabricate high performance  solar cells. As a powerful alternative to the widely used   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$    ETMs, ZnO materials share similar physical properties to   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   but with much higher electron mobility. In addition,  there are many simpler methods to fabricate   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanomaterials with low cost and energy consumption. In this article,  we briefly introduced different preparation methods of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$    materials used in PSCs and review the development history of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs. Since   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs were  first used in PSCs, the PCE of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs  has been boosted from   $5.0\\%$   to over   $17\\%$  . Besides the high  performance, ZnO nano materials are used to fabricate flexible devices, benefited from the rich varieties of fabrication  methods. This is another distinct advantage compared to   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$    ETMs.  \n\nCompared with the PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   ETMs, the performance of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based solar cells is still inferior. This  is mainly caused by the serious surface recombination, high  defect density, and poor stability. Many researches have been  carried out to address these issues in the last couple of years  and a number of plausible solutions have been proposed and  demonstrated. The future researches on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based  PSCs will continue to compete with their   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  counterparts.  It may still be the main focus to optimize the material quality  of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs and hence to reduce the recombination and  improve charge collections. The long term stability of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$    ETM based perovskite solar cell is another important problem  that must be solved in the next few years. Nonetheless, with all  that,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  -based perovskite solar cells have achieved a striking  success as their  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   counterparts and the march for next generation high efficient and low cost photovoltaic technology still  continues.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of  China under Grant Nos. 61421002, 61574029, 61371046, and 61474015.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)\n   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)\n   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)\n   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)\n   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)\n   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)\n\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:\n     - SYNTHESIS ROLE\n     - MATERIAL PROPERTY\n     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n     - REACTION MECHANISM\n     - PERFORMANCE METRIC\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:\n     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)\n     - Concentration or ratios of reagents\n     - Observed properties or characteristics\n     - Relationship to other materials or processes\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.
