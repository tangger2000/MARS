This property is particularly observed in composites such as CsPbBr3@PMMA and CsPbBr3@PMBA, where quantum dots (QDs) are embedded within a polymer matrix. The PL INTENSITY is a critical characteristic for assessing the luminescent efficiency of these quantum dot composites. It is influenced by factors such as the size and shape of the QDs, which can exhibit quantum confinement effects, affecting the material's optical properties. In research, the intensity of the photoluminescence of the QDs is often measured using techniques like spectroscopy to understand the material's luminescent behavior and to optimize synthesis conditions for potential applications in optoelectronics, such as LED displays and solar cells.\",5\n2605,QD PROPERTIES,,6\n1418,EXCITON BINDING ENERGY,\"The exciton binding energy refers to the energy necessary to transition an exciton from a bound state to free charge carriers, essentially the amount of energy required to dissociate the electron-hole pair that constitutes the exciton.

This property is crucial for understanding the optoelectronic characteristics of materials and is of significant interest in the field of materials science, particularly for applications in photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and laser technologies. The exciton binding energy is determined by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces within the crystal and can be influenced by factors such as lattice symmetry, dimensionality, and the presence of defects or impurities.
