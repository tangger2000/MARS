CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a.

Several attempts  have been made to address UV-induced stability issue.  We  also expose our PSCs using   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   QD ESLs to UV radiation.  Encouragingly, no obvious degradation of device performance  can be founded after   $2\\textrm{h}$   UV radiation, which may primarily  owing to its very low absorption to UV light photons duo to  its wide band gap energy   $(3.8~\\mathrm{eV}\\approx315~\\mathrm{nm}$  ) of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  QD layer  (Figure 6b).
