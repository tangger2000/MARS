By introducing   $7\\%$   GuaSCN into the perovskite  precursor solution, Yan and Zhu et  al. reported single-junction low-bandgap PSCs with PCEs over   $20\\%$  .  The matched  current density of tandem solar cells was correspondingly  improved to   $15\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , leading to a high PCE of   $23.1\\%$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.915\\mathrm{~V},$  , and an FF of   $79.8\\%$   in monolithic all-perovskite  tandem solar cells.  \n\nVery recently, we improved the charge carrier diffusion length  in mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb–Sn}$   per ovsk ites to   $3~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   via a com proportion ation  reaction strategy.  The high   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   values achieved here provided  the chances to further increase the matched current density in  tandem solar cells. An ALD $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2,}$  /ultrathin Au recombination  layer structure was developed to avoid the sputtered ITO layer  (Figure   $\\mathrm{9g)}$  ). As a result, the champion tandem device exhibited an  impressively high PCE of   $24.8\\%$  , with a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.965\\mathrm{~V},$   a high  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  of   $15.6\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and an FF of   $81.0\\%$   (Figure 9h).

Conclusions  \n\nWe have summarized the recent progress in the development  of tin halide and mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide PSCs. Methods that have  been utilized to improve performance and to enhance stability  are discussed. Two intertwined major challenges need to be  addressed for the development of tin halide PSCs. To overcome the over-quick crystallization of tin halide per ovsk ites,  the cation exchange method has been developed except for the  thermal evaporation and vapor-assisted methods. By incorporating large organic cations, the performance and stability of  tin halide devices can be enhanced under ambient conditions.  To mitigate the ox i diz ation of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{SnX}_{2}$     $(\\mathrm{X}\\,=\\,\\mathrm{F}$  , Cl) serving  as   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$   com pens at or and other reducing additives have been  introduced. With reducing additives and post treatment passivation,   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   PSCs exhibit improved performance and stability.  \n\nThe mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide per ovsk ites have demonstrated  great potentials to address the three main challenges,  including morphology, performance, and stability, leading to  high-performance devices. The low-bandgap mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$    halide per ovsk ites are promising candidates for fabricating  highly efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells. The monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells have achieved an impressive PCE of   $24.8\\%$  , which is comparable with those of silicon  solar cells. It is expected that the nontoxic (or less-toxic) Sn-contained per ovsk ites will have up-and-coming prospects for both  single-junction and tandem solar cells in the future.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nS.G. and R.L. contributed equally to this work.
