CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

However, no obvious difference in the overall  device degradation was observed.  Here, we confirmed that  unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   is also detrimental to the long-term operational  stability of PSCs with both the sophisticated CsFAMA-based  perovskite system and the classic   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   system because of  the formation of metallic Pb by the photolysis of   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   crystals  under continuous illumination. Metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   formed in perovskite films would act as carrier recombination centers, which  accelerates the degradation of PSCs.  This is supported by  decreased PL intensities in degraded perovskite films (Figure  S18, Supporting Information). Therefore, it is essential to  inhibit the formation of excess   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   in PSCs to obtain better  stability. On the other hand, excess organic cations have been  reported to be beneficial for PCEs of conventional   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  based PSCs.  However, our results on CsFAMA-based  per ovsk ites did not reveal such an improvement in PCE; a significant decrease in PCE was observed (Figure S19, Supporting  Information). This may be related to formation of pinholes in  the perovskite films as shown in SEM images of Figure S20  (Supporting Information).  \n\nIn summary, we have revealed that unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals  lower the long-term stability of PSCs and that it is possible to  improve the stability by reducing unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   in perovskite  films. The degradation of PSCs was related to the photolysis  of unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals into metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   and   $\\mathrm{I}_{2}$   under light  illumination. Metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   thus generated acted as a quencher  for carriers, which gradually made the PCEs lower. The PCEs  of PSCs with unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals reduced to   $47\\%$   of the  initial value after   $520\\,\\textrm{h}$   of continuous illumination while the  PCEs of PSCs, in which unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals were not present, retained   $99\\%$   of their initial values. This work will suggest  that preparing a precursor solution with an appropriate recipe  for spin-coating and confirming the existence of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals in  resulting perovskite films are crucial to fabricating efficient and  stable PSCs as well as other high-performing perovskite-based  opto-electronics devices.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : A   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   colloidal precursor solution   $\\left.\\left[\\right]5\\%\\right.$   tin(IV) oxide in  water] was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the precursor materials for  perovskite layers such as CsI, FAI, MABr,  ${\\mathsf{P}}{\\mathsf{b}}|_{2}$  , and  $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   were purchased  from Tokyo Chemical Industry. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from  Merck. Chl oro benzene, DMF, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and dopant  materials for the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, such as LiTFSI, 4-tBP, and FK-209,  were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The above purchased materials  were used without further purification.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : Glass substrates coated with a pre-patterned  indium tin oxide (ITO) layer with a thickness of   $100\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n m}$  (Atsugi  Micro) and a sheet resistance of   $\\mathsf{I0~Q~s q}^{-1}$   were cleaned sequentially  by ultrasonic ation in detergent, pure water, acetone, and iso prop an ol  each for   $10\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$   and then subjected to UV–ozone treatment for   $15~\\mathsf{m i n}$  .  After the substrate cleaning, the   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL was deposited on the ITO  layer by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  by using an aqueous   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$    colloidal solution, which was diluted to   $2.67\\%$   in water. The   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL  was annealed at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$  and then treated by UV–ozone for   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . The CsFAMA-based perovskite layer was prepared according  to literature.  The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by  mixing of FAI   $(1.10~\\mathrm{M})$  ,   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$     $(1.12~\\mathrm{M})$  , MABr   $(0.2~\\mathrm{M})$  , and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   (  $(0.2\\,\\mathrm{~M~})$    in anhydrous DMF/DMSO (4:1  vol/vol).   $0.08~\\mathrm{~M~}$  CsI was added to the  aforementioned precursor solution from a stock solution of   $\\mathsf{T.5\\\\M\\ C s i}$    in DMSO. Additionally, two different precursor solutions, in which  only the   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   concentration was changed to 1.15 or   $1.18~\\mathrm{~M~}$  , were also  prepared. These precursor solutions were stirred at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $^\\textrm{\\scriptsize5h}$   and  then filtered through a   $0.2\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   PTFE filter before use. Perovskite films  with different   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   contents were spin-coated from these solutions on  the substrates coated with ITO and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   at 1000 rpm for   $\\;\\;10\\;s$  , followed  by 6000  rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  . Ten seconds before the substrate rotation was  stopped,   $120~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   of chl oro benzene was dropped on the substrates to  obtain better-developed perovskite films. Subsequently, the substrates  were annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for 45  min. A solution used for spin-coating  an HTL was prepared by mixing   $0.5~\\mathrm{{mL}}$   of a spiro-OMeTAD solution  (  $(73\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$   in chl oro benzene),   $15\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of a 4-tBP solution   $(520~\\mathsf{m g\\,m L^{-1}}$    in acetonitrile),   $9\\;\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   of a LiTFSI solution   $(520~\\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$   in acetonitrile),  and  14.5  µ L  of  a  tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4- tert -but yl pyr i dine) cobalt(III)  tri[bis(tri flu oro methane)s ulf on imi de]  (FK209)  solution  (  $(300~\\mathsf{m g\\,m L^{-1}}$   in acetonitrile). A spiro-OMeTAD HTL was deposited on  top of the perovskite layers by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   from the  aforementioned solution.
