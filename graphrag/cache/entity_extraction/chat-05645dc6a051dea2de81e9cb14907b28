Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The hydroxy groups in PVA can be oxidized  either to aldehydes or to carboxylic acids, which can act as an  antioxidant to retard the oxidation of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$  .  Moreover, the  atomic ratio of   $\\mathrm{I}{:}\\mathrm{Sn}$   in the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   film was 1.3, and it was  1.6 for the   $\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3}–\\mathrm{PVA}$   film. The relatively higher ratio of  iodide ions in the surface of the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA film may be due  to the strong   $\\mathrm{O-H\\cdotsI^{-}}$   hydrogen bonds, which could suppress  the formation of iodide ion vacancies.  \n\nPhotovoltaic performances of the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  -based PSCs with or  without PVA were compared as shown in  Figure   4 a and  Table   1 .  The devices incorporated a planar p–i–n structure with the  configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FASnI 3  (with or without  PVA  $\\uplambda)/C_{60}/\\mathrm{BCP}/\\mathrm{Ag}$  . Figure  4a shows the current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   characteristics of the champion   ${\\mathrm{FAsnI}}_{3}$  -based PSCs with or  without PVA. The control device without PVA exhibited a representative PCE of only   $6.48\\%$   under the reverse scan. In contrast,  the best-performing   ${\\mathrm{FASI}}_{3}$  –PVA-based PSCs showed a much  better PCE of   $8.92\\%$   under the reverse scan. The enhancement  in all the photovoltaic parameters, i.e.,   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}},\\ V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   and FF, can be  attributed to the compact surface without pinholes, high crystal  orientation, long carrier lifetime, and low defect concentration of  the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA film. Especially, the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   value is increased from  0.55 to   $0.63\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$  after the addition of PVA, which is one of the  highest   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   value for the   ${\\mathrm{FASI}}_{3}$  -based PSCs. To further authenticate the veracity of the champion PCE, the steady-state photocurrent output at the voltage (0.49  V) close to the maximum  power point was measured (Figure 4b).  The current density for  the FASnI 3 –PVA PSC stays at  $17.6\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , corresponding to the  PCE of  $8.62\\%$  , which verifies the PCE value from the  $J{-}V$  curves.  \n\nThe external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the bestperforming device based on   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   with or without PVA is presented in Figure 4c.

The EQE in the range of 350–650 and   $750{-}900\\:\\mathrm{nm}$   for the  ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA-based PSC is obviously higher  than that of the pristine   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  -based PSC, which is due to the  improved perovskite film quality with reduced trap density. The  EQE of the   $\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3}–\\mathrm{PVA}$   device in the range of   $650{-}750~\\mathrm{nm}$   is  relatively lower, which might be related to the lower absorption  at   $650{-}750\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   of the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA film (Figure S6, Supporting  Information).  \n\nTo further understand the change at the band edge of the   $\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3}–\\mathrm{PVA}$   film, we provided the semi-log plot of EQE values  versus photon energy ( E ) as shown in Figure 4d. We first estimated the bandgap from the inflection point of EQE.  After  the addition of PVA, the bandgap of   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   is not changed at   $1.37~\\mathrm{eV}.$   This indicates that the PVA molecule is located at the  grain boundary of the perovskite film. In addition, the slope  of the exponential EQE tail defines the Urbach energy   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{u}}\\right)$  according to the equation of   $\\mathrm{EQE}\\,=\\,\\mathrm{EQE}_{0}$   exp   $[(E\\mathrm{~-~}E_{\\mathrm{g}})/E_{\\mathrm{u}}]$  ,  where  $\\mathrm{EQE}_{0}$   is the EQE value at the bandgap   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$  .  An Urbach  tail with sharper slope can be clearly observed for the   $\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3^{-}}$  PVA film with   $E_{\\mathrm{u}}$   of   $16.3\\ \\mathrm{meV},$   which is obviously lower than  that of the pristine   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   film   $(18.8\\ \\mathrm{meV})$  , indicating lower  structural disorder and better crystalline quality of the   $\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3^{-}}$  PVA film. Such a low level of structural disorder of   $\\mathrm{FAsnI}_{3^{-}}$  PVA could bring down the parasitic recombination of charge  carriers and enhance the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of the device.  \n\nMost importantly, superior operational stability was observed  for the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  –PVA-based PSC device ( Figure   5 a). The photocurrent output at the voltage close to the maximum power point  was measured in the ambient air under continuous one sun illumination (with a   $420~\\mathrm{nm}$   cutoff UV filter) at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . It is noted  that the devices were UV encapsulated with a cover glass using  a low-cost epoxy resin under a nitrogen atmosphere (Figure S9,  Supporting Information). Surprisingly, no decay in efficiency  was observed after   $400\\mathrm{~h~}$\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
