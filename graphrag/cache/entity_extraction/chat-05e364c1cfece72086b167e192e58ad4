CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

We  fabricated both hole-only devices (structure: ITO/poly-TPD/ perovskite/CBP/  $\\mathrm{{/MoO_{3}/A g})}$   and electron-only devices (structure:   $\\mathrm{ITO/S n O}_{2}/$  perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al), respectively. Three distinct  regions could be clearly identified from the   $I{-}V$  curves including  Ohmic, trap-filled limited as well as SCLC regions. We extract  hole and electron trap density from hole and electron only  devices, respectively, using equation   $N_{\\mathrm{trans}}\\;=\\;2\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}/(q L^{2})$  ,  where the  $\\varepsilon_{0},\\,\\varepsilon_{r}\\,q_{:}$  , and  $L$   are the vacuum permittivity, the relative  dielectric constant, elementary charge, and the thickness of the  \n\nTable 1.   Parameters of the perovskite films with various additives. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/aca0b8e62fc41c6987b2a24faa4c92b7d42fbb3823b1d3f145ba39730b928831-1727100347.jpg)  \na) TRPL measurement is conducted at a wavelength of   $369\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   and an excitation intensity of   $0.6\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  ;  b) PLQY measurement is conducted at a wavelength of   $430\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  and an excitation intensity of   $0.6\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  .  \n\nperovskite films, respectively.  As shown in  Figure 4 a–d, the  density of hole traps reaches   $2.52\\times10^{16}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   after incorporation of  $40\\%$   FPMATFA, which is one order of magnitude lower  than the control device   $\\left(N_{\\mathrm{trans}}=1.18\\times10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\right)$  . The density  of electron traps also reduces obviously from   $9.74\\,\\times\\,10^{16}$   to   $6.72\\times10^{16}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . These results further demonstrate the dual  pass iv ation effect of FPMATFA. In Figure  4e, we summarize the density of hole and electron traps, PLQY and EQE  of perovskite films as a function of the content of FPMATFA  (Figure S10, Supporting Information). It clearly demonstrates  the better pass iv ation effect of FPMATFA, and further proves  that lower electron/hole trap density results in higher PLQY as  well as better device performance.  \n\nThe traps at crystal lite surface and ion migration along  grain boundaries are the main reasons for hysteresis and  instability in perovskite devices.  The hysteresis is  expected to be more severe in mixed-halide perovskite devices  than that in single-halide perovskite devices because the traps  and ion migration also cause phase segregation to domains  with different bandgaps.  For this reason, we measure  the hysteresis of our PeLEDs with   $40\\%$     $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   and  FPMATFA as additive, respectively. As shown in  Figure 5 a,b,  both the control device and device with   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   or   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$   show severe hysteresis, whereas the device  with FPMATFA shows a relatively slight hysteresis. Transient EL measurement also supports the results of hysteresis  measurement. As shown in Figure  5c, the inject current of  the control device gradually increases under pulse voltages  resulting from high trap density, while the PeLEDs with   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   and FPMATFA show a relative steady current. Normalized luminance under pulse voltage is shown in  Figure 5d. The FPMATFA device shows a shorter rising time,  indicating lower trap density.  This result also suggests that  FPMATFA has better pass iv ation effect. It is also possible  that the stronger   $\\mathrm{I-Pb}$   bonding with addition of FPMATFA  suppresses the halide migrations and thus reduces the  hysteresis.  \n\nWe finally measured the EL spectrum and operational stability of our mixed-halide PeLEDs. The thermal, optical, and  atmospheric al stability of the bare films were first examined  (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The FPMATFA-passivated films have better thermal and optical stability than  the films with   $\\mathrm{FPMI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$   due to the pass iv ation effect.  Nevertheless, it shows relatively poor atmospheric al stability  which might be due to the   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  -absorbing TFA ligands. Our  devices were tested in   $\\Nu_{2}$   glove box with   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   level   ${<}5$   ppm  to avoid the influence of humidity. The evolution of EL  spectrum of the PeLEDs under different voltages is shown  in Figure  5e. The EL peak gradually redshifts with applied  voltage increasing from 3 to   $6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   for the control device due  to phase segregation. The EL spectrum becomes more stable  after incorporation of   $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$  . In contrast, the EL peak  position and FWHM remain unchanged for the device with  FPMATFA, demonstrating a superior spectrum stability after  pass iv ation. The operational stability was measured at a constant current density of   $2.5~\\mathrm{mA~cm}^{-2}$  . The   $T_{50}$   of the devices  increases from 0.25 to 0.8, 4.5, and   $^{14\\mathrm{~h~}}$  , respectively, with   $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$  , and FPMATFA passiva- tion (Figure 5f). In addition, the device with FPMATFA also  shows much better storage stability than the control device.  The EQE of the control device decreases to   $50\\%$   of their initial value after 2 months, while the device with FPMATFA  is stable without degradation (Figure S12, Supporting  Information).  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we have synthesized FPMATFA to simultaneously passivate lead and halide defects in MHPs. XPS measurements and DFT calculations demonstrate the coordination of  FPMA and TFA ions with halide and lead defects, respectively,  and dual pass iv ation effects.
