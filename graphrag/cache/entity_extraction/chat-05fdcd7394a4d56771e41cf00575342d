CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The mechanism of charge transport process and band-bending at the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene/  $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  interface are further analyzed according to the Schottky–Mott  limit on the basis of the relative alignment of energy levels. The energy level of perovskite is measured by UPS measurement and Kubelka-Munk plot, as shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information. The CBM   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{c}}\\right)$  , valence band maximum \n\n  $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{v}}\\right)$  , bandgap   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$  , and   $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}$   of   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   perovskite are \n\n  $-3.92$  ,   $-5.46$  ,   $-1.54$  , and   $-4.53~\\mathrm{~eV,}$   respectively. The energy  barrier for electrons   $(\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{e}})$   or holes   $(\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{h}})$   transport across the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene  $/\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   interface can be defined as the  energy difference between the  $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   of the  $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene film and  the  $E_{\\mathrm{c}}$   or  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$   of perovskite film. The WF of the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene   $(4.65\\,\\mathrm{\\eV})$   is   $0.12\\,\\mathrm{~eV}$   higher than that of the   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  perovskite film, which results in an upward band-bending at  the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene  $\\mathrm{^7FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   interface, as illustrated  in Figure  3c. This upward band-bending hinders the photogenerated electrons transport from the   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   perovskite layer to the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene ETL, causing severe carrier  accumulation and recombination at this interface. The   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{e}}$  and   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{h}}$   at the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene/  $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   interface are  calculated to be 0.73 and   $0.81~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively. The large   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{e}}$  is not conducive to the transportation of electrons, while the  small   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{h}}$   cannot effectively block the transportation of holes,  which causes a large number of electron-hole pairs recombination at the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene/   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   interface. For  the   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene with a lower WF of   $4.34~\\mathrm{eV}_{\\ast}$  , a downward  band-bending occurs at the   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene/  $\\mathrm{^7FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  interface, which facilitates the electrons transport from the  perovskite layer to the   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene ETL, as shown in  Figure 3d. The   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{e}}$   and  $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{h}}$   at this interface are calculated to be  0.42 and  $1.12\\;\\mathrm{eV}.$  . The downward band-bending and reduced  $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{e}}$  are beneficial to improve the electron transportation efficiency  at the   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene/  $\\mathrm{^7FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   interface. Besides,  the enhanced   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{h}}$   can effectively block holes transport from  the perovskite to the   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene ETL, thus reducing the  charge recombination and energy loss at the   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene/\n\n  $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   interface.  It is worth noting that the reduced \n\n  $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{e}}$   and enhanced   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{h}}$   will increase the built-in potential as  well as the open circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   of PVSCs by increasing the  charge separation and transportation efficiency.  \n\nDespite the op to electrical properties of the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene  ETL, the crystallization quality of perovskite film also affects the  performance and stability of PVSCs because most carriers’  recombination and degradation of perovskite crystal firstly  occurs at the grain boundaries. The   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene film  shows smaller contact angle   $(28.2^{\\circ})$   compared with the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene film  $(29.4^{\\circ})$   due to the hydrophilic it y of  $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  groups (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The hydrophilic  substrate will increase the nucleation density of the perovskite,  thereby promoting the formation of a more compact and denser  perovskite photo active layer. The surface morphology of perovskite films grown on the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   and   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene substrates are investigated by field emission scanning electron  microscope (FESEM), as shown in  Figure    4 a,b. The average  grain size of perovskite grown on the   $\\mathrm{T}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene film   $(304~\\mathrm{nm})$   is larger than that grown on the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene  film   $(264~\\mathrm{nm})$  ), which may be caused by the   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   groups on  the   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene because the N-H forms hydrogen bond  with   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   in the perovskite precursor and retards the crystal lization process.  Based on this result, we further dope different  amounts of\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
