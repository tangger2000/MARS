Recently,  impressive external quantum efficiencies  (EQEs) exceeding   $20\\%$   are obtained for  green, red, and near-infrared perovskitebased LEDs (PeLEDs) through the efforts  of perovskite material optimization and  device architecture design.  These  achievements firmly prompt the potential applications of PeLEDs in display and  illumination fields. However, compared  with the efficient PeLEDs, there is only  moderate performance reported for blue  PeLEDs,  which undoubtedly restrict  PeLED applications in full-color displays  and white-light illumination. Thus, the  breakthroughs of the device performance  are urgently required for blue PeLEDs.  \n\nWhile there  has been extensive investigation into modulating quasi-2D  perovskite compositions in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for promoting their  electroluminescence, very few reports have studied approaches involving  enhancement of the energy transfer between quasi-2D perovskite layers of  the film, which plays very important role for achieving high-performance  perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). In this work, a bi functional ligand of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA) cation is strategically introduced into the perovskite  to diminish the weak van der Waals gap between individual perovskite  layers for promoting coupled quasi-2D perovskite layers. In particular, the  strengthened interaction between coupled quasi-2D perovskite layers favors  an efficient energy transfer in the perovskite films. The introduced ABA can  also simultaneously passivate the perovskite defects by reducing metallic  Pb for less non radiative recombination loss. Benefiting from the advanced  properties of ABA incorporated per ovsk ites, highly efficient blue PeLEDs with  external quantum efficiency of   $10.11\\%$   and a very long operational stability of   ${\\pmb\\delta}1.3\\ {\\pmb m}i{\\pmb n}$  , among the best performing blue quasi-2D PeLEDs, are achieved.  Consequently, this work contributes an effective approach for high-performance and stable blue PeLEDs toward practical applications.  \n\nSubstantial efforts have been made  in the past several years to obtain blue  perovskite emitters, such as perovskite  nano crystals (NCs),  2D perovskite  nano platelets,  and quasi-2D perovskites.  In particular, the quasi-2D  per ovsk ites are rising as efficient luminescent materials for highly performed blue PeLEDs due to  \n\nMetal halide per ovsk ites have emerged as competitive candidates for the next-generation light-emitting diodes (LEDs)  due to their excellent optical properties, such as tunable light  emission color, high color purity, and high photo luminescence  \n\nthe cascade energy landscape for efficient exciton transfer  and the subsequent radiative recombination. Typically, the  quasi-2D per ovsk ites have a formula of   $\\mathrm{B}_{2}(\\mathrm{APbBr}_{3})_{n-1}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{4},$    where B is an organic spacer cation, A is a monovalent cation \n\n (e.g.,   $C s^{+}$  , methyl ammonium   $\\left(\\mathrm{MA^{+}}\\right)$   or form amid in i um, \n\n  $\\left(\\mathrm{FA^{+}}\\right))$  ), and  $n$   represents the number of lead halide octahedral  layers.  The organic spacer cations play a vital role in modulation of perovskite properties, such as the emission peak,  structural morphology, defect level, phase distribution, and  thus the PeLED performances. For example, Yip et al. reported  a structural modulated quasi-2D perovskite through adopting  the spacer cation of 2-phe no xy ethyl amine, and obtained an  EQE of   $1.1\\%$   for the blue PeLEDs.  They further introduced  phenyl ethyl ammonium  bromide  (PEABr)  into  the   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{0.9}\\mathrm{Br}_{2.1}$   to form a quasi-2D perovskite with effective suppression of traps, and achieved   $5.7\\%$   efficiency at   $480\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . Jin et  al. reported utilization of phenyl but yl amine bromide \n\n (PBABr) as the spacer cation to construct   $\\mathrm{PBR}_{\\gamma}(\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.7}\\mathrm{FA}_{0.3}$   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}\\mathrm{)}$   with perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in quasi2D phases, and obtained an EQE of   $9.5\\%$   and lifetime of   $250~\\mathrm{s}$    for the blue PeLEDs.  In addition, the joint organic cations,  such as PEABr and but yl ammonium bromide (BABr),  PEABr  and prop yl ammonium bromide (PABr),  PEABr and iso-propy l ammonium bromide (IPABr),  and 1,4-Bis(amino methyl) benzene bromide   $(\\mathrm{P{-}P D A B r_{2}})$  ) and PEABr  were also employed  as the spacer cations to modulate the quasi-2D perovskite phase  distribution for high phase purity and thus efficient light emission. Besides optimizing the organic spacer cations in quasi-2D  per ovsk ites, the composition of “A-site” has been also tuned to  prolong PeLED operational stability, such as rubidium-cesium  alloyed quasi-2D   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}(\\mathrm{Rb}_{x}\\mathrm{Cs}_{1-x})_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3n+1}$   perovskite,  and  mixture of monovalent cation perovskite (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}(\\mathrm{Cs}/\\mathrm{Rb}/$   $\\mathrm{FA}/\\mathrm{K})\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}$     $(\\mathrm{Cl}/\\mathrm{Br})_{3n+1}{}^{[48]})$  . Recently, another strategy of incorporating yttrium chloride into the quasi-2D perovskite was  reported, in which the charge carriers were confined inside  perovskite grains for efficient radiative recombination, and the  blue PeLED efficiency of   $11\\%$   was achieved.  \n\nIt is known that quasi-2D per ovsk ites usually contain a mixture of phases and the phase impurity (especially a wide distribution and large amount of low-order phases) could result  in low emission efficiency due to inefficient internal energy  transfer.  Thus fine control of the quasi-2D perovskite composition for high phase purity is a good approach to promote  internal energy transfer for improved PeLED efficiency. Besides, it is noted that the quasi-2D perovskite layers are separated from each other by spacer cations. Typical spacer cations,  such as   $\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{B}\\mathrm{A}^{+}$   can only interact with the perovskite layers  at one side and leave a van der Waals gap with other quasi2D perovskite layers.  It is thus a concern that the van der  Waals gap will induce a loose space between quasi-2D perovskite layers and subsequently inefficient energy transfer in the  perovskite film causing poor PeLED efficiency. Besides, the  presence of weak van der Waals gaps also deteriorates the stability of quasi-2D perovskite structure due to easy degradation  of perovskite structure upon exposure to different operation  conditions, such as continuous heat and light soaking during  PeLED operation.  Consequently, reduction of the van der  Waals gaps and strengthened interaction between quasi-2D  perovskite layers are very important to obtain well-performed  PeLEDs.  \n\nIn this work, we introduce a bi functional ligand of 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA) cation into the perovskite to  diminish the weak van der Waals gaps for promoting the coupling of quasi-2D perovskite layers via the bi functional group  of amino and carbox\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
