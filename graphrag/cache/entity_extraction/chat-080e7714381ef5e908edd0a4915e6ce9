Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Djurišic ,\\* Zhubing He,\\* and Xugang Guo\\*  \n\nMetal halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs)  have attracted a great deal of attention  from both scientific and industrial communities in the past few years due to their  intriguing photo physical properties, high  power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), and  great potential for low-cost solution processing.  There are three typical device  architectures  of  PVSCs:  mesoporous  structure, planar n–i–p (or conventional)  structure, and   $\\mathrm{p-i-n}$   (or inverted) structure.  While the record efficiencies of  inverted PVSCs are generally lower compared to those of conventional ones (both  planar and mesoscopic), inverted PVSCs  are more compatible with low-temperature processing and generally exhibit suppressed hysteresis effect.  In addition,  the inverted architecture is also suitable  for improving the efficiency of silicon/ perovskite tandem cells.  Therefore, there  is considerable interest in improving the  device performance of inverted PVSCs.  \n\nHole-transporting materials (HTMs) play a critical role in realizing efficient  and stable perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Considering their capability of  enabling PVSCs with good device reproducibility and long-term stability,  high-performance dopant-free small-molecule HTMs (SM-HTMs) are greatly  desired. However, such dopant-free SM-HTMs are highly elusive, limiting the  current record efficiencies of inverted PVSCs to around  $\\mathbf{\\Pi}_{19\\%}$  . Here, two novel  donor–acceptor-type SM-HTMs (MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI) are devised, which  synergistic ally integrate several design principles for high-performance HTMs,  and exhibit comparable op to electronic properties but distinct molecular configuration and film properties. Consequently, the dopant-free MPA-BTTI-based  inverted PVSCs achieve a remarkable efficiency of  $21.17\\%$   with negligible  hysteresis and superior thermal stability and long-term stability under illumination, which breaks the long-time standing bottleneck in the development of  dopant-free SM-HTMs for highly efficient inverted PVSCs. Such a breakthrough  is attributed to the well-aligned energy levels, appropriate hole mobility, and  most importantly, the excellent film morphology of the MPA-BTTI. The results  underscore the effectiveness of the design tactics, providing a new avenue for  developing high-performance dopant-free SM-HTMs in PVSCs.  \n\nIn inverted PVSCs, in addition to compositional modulation of the perovskite absorber, inter facial  engineering plays a decisive role in achieving high efficiency  and long-term stability.  The interface properties between the  perovskite absorber and the hole-transporting material (HTM,  or the p-layer in the p–i–n structure) are critically dependent on  the HTM. Three classes of HTMs are utilized in PVSCs, namely,  inorganic HTMs, polymeric HTMs, and organic-small-molecule  HTMs (SM-HTMs).  Inorganic HTMs  usually show  good device stability, but the achievable PCE is limited by their  relatively low intrinsic conductivity and surface defects.  Polymeric HTMs  result in good morphological properties but  inferior reproducibility and stability, in particular when dopants  are needed for high efficiency devices.  A possible solution  to address the issues associated with the current HTMs to  achieve highly efficient PVSCs with facile process ability, good  performance reproducibility, and long-term stability is the use  of dopant-free SM-HTMs.  However, the highest reported  efficiencies to date are still around   $19\\%$  ( Figure    1 a; Table S1,  Supporting Information).  Therefore, exploring new SMHTMs to further improve the device performance of PVSCs is  urgent. Ideal dopant-free SM-HTMs should have good solubility  in common solvents, high thermal stability (i.e., high decomposition temperature   $\\left(T_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right)$   and glass transition temperature   $\\left(T_{\\mathrm{g}}\\right))$  ),  low absorption in the visible region,  suitable energy  level alignment with the perovskite absorber,  and high hole  mobility and conductivity.  In addition to these general criteria for ensuring good film quality and minimizing optical and  electrical losses, several molecular design principles are also  identified for achieving highly efficient dopant-free SM-HTMs.  First, donor–acceptor (D–A) molecular backbone is conceived as  a desirable structural feature due to its intramolecular charge  transfer (ICT) character and high dipole moment, which could  induce self-doping and built-in potential to boost charge extraction.  Second, bis(4-meth oxy phenyl)amine has been identified as the preferential hole-transporting moiety to improve  charge mobility at molecular level due to its easy ox i diz ability  and its ability to effectively transport positive charge. Also, the  pseudo-3D conjugated architecture of tri phenyl amine building  block may endow molecules with isotropic charge transport  property.  Third, reinforced intermolecular interactions and   $\\pi{-}\\pi$  stacking are expected to result in high conductivity, which  could be achieved by employing planar building blocks widely  used in organic field-effect transistors or thermo electrics, such  as thiophene-based derivatives.  Moreover, sulfur (S) atoms  can passivate defects in perovskite by coordinating   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   vacancies.  Finally, Lewis base groups (e.g., carbonyl and cyano substituent) capable of pas siva ting defects  are hence desired to  be incorporated to enhance the pass iv ation of perovskite layer.  \n\nBased on these considerations, in this work, we design and  synthesize two imide-functional i zed thiophene-based HTMs,  2,8-bis(4-(bis(4-meth oxy phenyl)amino)phenyl)-5-octyl-4 H - dithieno[3,2- c :2 ′ ,3 ′ - e ]azepine-4,6(5 H )-dione and 2,8-bis(4-(bis(4- meth oxy phenyl)amino)phenyl)-5-dodecyl-4 H -thieno  $[2^{\\prime}\\!,\\!3^{\\prime}\\!:\\!4,\\!5]$  thieno[3,2- c ]thieno[2 ′ ,3 ′ :4,5]thieno[2,3- e ]azepine-4,6(5 H )-dione  (Figure  1b, designated as MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI, respectively). These molecules show comparable photo physical and  electrochemical properties but remarkably distinct molecular  configuration, packing characteristics, and the resultant film  morphology. When utilized as the dopant-free SM-HTMs  in inverted PVSCs, the MPA-BTTI-based device achieves an  unprecedented performance showing a champion PCE of \n\n  $21.17\\%$   with a  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.12, a  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of  $23.23\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and a fill factor \n\n (FF) of 0.81, which outperforms the MPA-BTI-based device  with a PCE of   $17.20\\%$  . The efficiency   $(21.17\\%)$   is approaching  the highest value   $(21.6\\%)$   achieved in inverted single-junction  PVSCs reported to date.  Furthermore, the MPA-BTTI-based  device exhibits negligible hysteresis   $(21.17\\%$   and   $21.01\\%$   for  reverse and forward scans, respectively) and excellent long-term  thermal stability and stability under illumination. The devices  retain   $90\\%$   of the original PCE after   $500\\textrm{h}$   constant illumination and   $94\\%$   of the initial PCE after thermal stress at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    for   $800\\,\\mathrm{h}$   in inert environment.
