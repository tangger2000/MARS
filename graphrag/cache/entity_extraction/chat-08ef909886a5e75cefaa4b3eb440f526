OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

After being dried with a stream of   $\\mathsf{N}_{2},$   the  substrates were treated with an ultraviolet plasma for   $30\\;\\mathsf{m i n}$   to remove  organic residues. Then, poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)amine)  (PTAA) dissolved in toluene at a concentration of   $5~\\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$   was spincoated onto the FTO substrate at a speed of 6000  rpm for   $30\\,\\mathrm{\\sf~s},$  , and  the substrate was then annealed at   $120\\,\\,\\,\\,{}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $20~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The perovskite  precursor solution composed of   $0.8\\,\\mathrm{\\M~}\\,\\mathsf{H P b}|_{3}$   and   $0.8\\,\\mathrm{~\\textmu~}\\,{\\sf C s l}$   in  N , N - dimethyl form amide without or with the addition of OTG molecules   $(0.1\\mathrm{-}1\\%$   in molar ratio) was then stirred at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   overnight, and the  resulting solution was spin-coated on the PTAA layer (preheated at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C})$   at 2000 rpm for   $35\\ \\mathsf{s}$  . The substrate was then annealed at   $90~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$    for 5 min and   $\\ 750\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $20~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . A layer of [6,6]phenyl C61 butyric acid  methyl ester (PCBM) was then deposited by spin-coating  $25~\\mathsf{m g\\,m L^{-1}}$   of  PCBM chl oro benzene solution onto the perovskite film at   $800\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  and heating at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . Bath o cup roi ne (BCP) was then  coated onto the PCBM layer by depositing  $140\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of methanol-saturated  solution drop by drop at 6000  rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{~s~}$   followed by annealing at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 5  min. All of these steps were conducted in a   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$  -protected  glove box in which the partial pressures of   $\\mathsf{O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$   were less than  0.01 ppm. Finally, a  $100\\;\\mathsf{n m}$   layer of silver was thermally evaporated onto  the as-prepared films to serve as an electrode under high vacuum (lower  than  $2\\times10^{-4}\\ \\mathsf{P a}_{,}$  ).  \n\nFilm Characterization : A field-emission scanning electron microscope  (JSM-7800F Prime, JEOL) was used to observe the morphology of  the as-obtained perovskite films. The steady-state photo luminescence  spectrum was measured with a Horiba Fluoromax-4 fluorescence  spectrometer using a 500 nm excitation light source. The time-resolved  photo luminescence decay was recorded with a Horiba Fluorolog-3 Time  Correlated Single Photon Counting system with the excitation wavelength  fixed at   $440\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  . The XPS analysis was carried out on a Kratos AXIS Ultra  DLD spectrometer with an Al   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  X-ray source. The XRD patterns were  measured on a Rigaku Ultima IV powder X-ray diffract o meter using  $\\mathsf{C u}$     $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  radiation source with a scan rate of   $5^{\\circ}\\,\\mathsf{m i n}^{-1}$  . The UV–vis absorption  spectra of the perovskite samples were recorded with a Shimadzu  UV 2450 spectrometer. TGA measurements were conducted on a  thermo grav i metric analyzer (Pyris 1 TGA) in the nitrogen atmosphere  with a heating rate of   $10\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}\\ \\mathsf{m i n}^{-1}$  . Liquid-state   $^1{\\sf H}$   NMR analysis was  performed on the   $600\\ \\mathsf{M H z}$   nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer  (Avance III600 MHz) using d6-DMSO as deuterated solvent. ToF-SIMS  measurements were performed using the focused ion beam ToF-SIMS  spectrometer (GAIA3 GMU Model 2016, Czech). A   $30\\;\\mathrm{\\sf~keV}\\;\\mathrm{\\sf~Bi^{+}}$   ion  beam was used as the primary ion beam to peel the samples with an  analysis area of   $5\\,\\times\\,5\\,\\,\\upmu m^{2}$  . The linear voltage sweep analysis used to  investigate the space charge limited current curves was performed on  a multi functional electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany), with  a constant step voltage of  $20\\ \\mathsf{m V}$   and a scan window from  $0\\;\\vee$   to  $4\\;\\lor.$  \n\nDevice Characterization:  $J^{-V}$  curves of the PSCs were measured with a  digital source meter (Keithley 2400) under simulated solar illumination  of   $100\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   (AM 1.5G). The intensity of the light source was  determined with a standard silicon reference cell (Wacom Denso Co.,  Japan). The measurements were conducted by a reverse (from 1.2 to   $-0.2\\;\\forall)$  ) or forward (from  $-0.2$   to 1.2 V) scan. The step voltage and delay  time were fixed at  $10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$   and  $30\\:\\mathsf{m s}$  , respectively. Monochromatic internal  photon-to-current efficiency spectral measurements were characterized  by using a monochromatic incident light with an irradiance of   $\\rceil\\times\\rceil0^{\\rceil6}$    photons   $\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}\\ \\mathsf{s}^{-1}$   in direct-current mode. The TPV measurement was  recorded on a multi functional electrochemical analysis instrument  (Zahner, Germany). The emission light was generated by a pulse of  white light incident on solar cells under open-circuit conditions. No  background light was applied. The photo stability of the PSCs was tested  with continuous illumination from a white LED lamp   $(\\uparrow00\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\ c m^{-2})$  ).  The devices were put in a glass dry box with a relative humidity of less  than  $\\rceil0\\%$  . Ultraviolet light   $(<\\!420\\ \\mathsf{n m})$  ) was cut off with an optical filter.  \n\nFirst-Principles Calculation : Geometry optimization s of the OTG1,  OTG2, and OTG3 molecules were conducted on the Guassian  09 program by using B3LYP and the all-electron double $\\xi$  valence  basis sets of   ${\\mathsf{6}}{\\mathsf{-}}{\\mathsf{3}}\\,{\\mathsf{I}}\\,{\\mathsf{C}}^{\\ast}$   with default spin\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
