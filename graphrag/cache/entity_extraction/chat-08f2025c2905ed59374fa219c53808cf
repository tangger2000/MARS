CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The red curve is a fit to the experimental data with a single exponential decay function. d) Pseudo color map of the temperaturedependent PL spectra of  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{:}2.75\\%\\mathsf{B i}$   crystal.  \n\nBy fitting the temperature dependent integrated PL intensity  (Figure S5b, Supporting Information), an Arrhenius behavior  with two activated energy of 30 and   $230\\,\\mathrm{\\meV}$   was observed  (fitting with one activation energy failed). This suggests activation of two defects, one donor and one acceptor,  and we  tentatively ascribe them to   $\\mathrm{V_{Cl}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$  , which is the thermodynamically preferred defect complex, as will be revealed by theoretical simulation later. Optical transition between this defect  complex is thus hypothesized to be responsible for the observed  PL, however, the luminescent mechanism still calls for further  careful study. In addition, a fitting of the FWHM has been  applied by a phonon broadening model.  For the fitting, electron–phonon coupling parameter  S  and   $\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{phonon}}$   are calculated  as 31.1 and   $22.3\\ \\mathrm{meV}$   (Figure S5c, Supporting Information),  which suggested strong electron–phonon coupling in the soft  halide matrix.  \n\nAbove characterization and analysis suggested that the PL  is likely to be originated from donor–acceptor pair emission  instead of direct emission from   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$  . Therefore, we performed  density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the  electronic states of the Bi incorporated in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   and their  effects on the op to electronic and photo physical properties. The  Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional was used,  since it provides a reasonable bandgap of   $3.93\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   close to the  experimental value of   $3.90\\;\\mathrm{eV}.$  \n\nIt is known that the dopability in semiconductor depends significantly on the chemical condition of the synthesis process. In  this context, we first determined the chemical potential window  (the yellow region) where the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   phase is stabilized, as  shown in  Figure   5 a. It is seen that   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   exhibits a quite  large chemical potential region, as compared to those reported  for typical   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   halide per ovsk ites, indicating the easy formation of pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   phase. From the chemical window, the  lowest decomposition enthalpy   $(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{d}})$   is calculated to be   $1.37~\\mathrm{eV}$  per formula unit (f.u.) along the decomposition pathway   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}\\rightarrow2\\mathrm{CsCl}+\\mathrm{SnCl}_{4}$  . This value is one or two orders  of magnitude larger than those for the typical   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   halide  per ovsk ites (e.g.,   $-0.09$  , 0.15, 0.29, and   $0.47\\,\\mathrm{~eV}$  per f.u. for   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$  ,    $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}.$  ,  and   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{n}}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{3}$  , respectively)  and recently reported halide double per ovsk ites (e.g., 0.05, 0.16,  and   $0.06\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   per f.u. for   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  ,  $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i C l_{6}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}.$  respectively),  which explains the above-observed superior  thermal stability for   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   (see Figures S2 and S4 in the  Supporting Information).  \n\nThen, we studied the solubility and the electronic states  of the Bi incorporated in   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   by supercell defect calculations. We first considered two most probable states, i.e., Bi  interstitial (Bi i ) (at the   $\\sqsupset$   site in   $\\mathrm{A}_{2}\\mathrm{Sn}\\boxed{\\mathrm{X}_{6}}$  , where   $\\sqsupset$   denotes  a vacancy site in this vacancy-ordered double perovskite structure) and Bi-on-Sn substitution   $\\left(\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}\\right)$  . The calculated formation enthalpies   $(\\Delta H)$   for neutral   $\\mathrm{Bi_{i}}$  and   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   are shown  in Figure 5b (olive and blue lines, respectively). Obviously,   $\\mathrm{Bi_{i}}$   has too high   $\\Delta H$   values in the whole chemical potential  regions, and thus can hardly form.   $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   also can hardly form  under the   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}{-}r i c h/S n^{2+}}$  -poor conditions (i.e., in the high   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$  regions   $_{\\mathrm{C-F}}$   in the yellow region in Figure 5a) due to the too  high   $\\Delta H$   values; but it can form under   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}{-}p o o r/S n^{2+}}$  -rich  conditions (in the low  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$   regions A, B, and G), where the  $\\Delta H$  values are low and even negative. This result indicates that a   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  -poor/  ${'}\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$  -rich condition, i.e., a   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$  -based reagent, is  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/f7ca8852a33abb1fb6adf4d1e99c222fff6e5448ab31ae1148d1a96e835d4ec7-1723824435.jpg)  \nFigure 5.   a) Calculated chemical potential window where   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}$   is stabilized against possible competing phases including Cs, Sn,   ${\\sf C I}_{2}$  , CsCl,   $\\mathsf{S n C l}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathsf{S n C l}_{4}$  ,  $\\mathsf{C s S n\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
