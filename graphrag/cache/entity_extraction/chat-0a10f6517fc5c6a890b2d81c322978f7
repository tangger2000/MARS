CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Specially, halide perovskite  compounds with A site occupied by the organic–inorganic ions  such as MA or FA, they may actually decompose by reacting  with oxygen and water, as follows the conversion to carbon  species. On the other hand, PQDs are characterized by small  size with high surface energy coordinated by organic ligands.  The absorbed heat can result in desorption and irreversible  decomposition of organic ligands above   $450\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{K}},$  , making PQDs  a strong tendency to aggregate under harsh conditions, which  further reshapes the appearance of PQDs easily with increasing  temperature, producing a series of non radiative recombination centers and quenching the emission of PQDs seriously  (Figure 1c).  \n\nThe encapsulation materials such as   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  , rigid crystalline  zeolite framework or other robust hosts as glasses are good  insulators, which can lead to an effective isolation of PQDs for  preventing heat propagation between heater source and PQDs.  Dispersing PQDs into inorganic matrix at nano- or microscale  can also suppress aggregation caused by temperature increase  and reduce the thermal damage effectively (Figure  1c). For  example, the PL emission and intensity of PQDs embedded  in MS (mesoporous silica) at high temperature are nearly the  same as that of before treatment.  PQDs protected by robust  host lattices as glass or ceramic show higher thermal resistances. The PL emission of PQDs  $@$  glass can burden thermal  treatment at temperatures ranging from 400 to   $600~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , appropriate for high power device.  The energy difference  between the exciton binding energy   $(E_{\\mathrm{b}})$   and thermal disturbance energy   $\\mathrm{\\mathit{\\left(E_{t}=26\\ m e V\\right)}}$  ) at room temperature is an effective  evaluation for thermal stability of materials.  The   $E_{\\flat}$   can be  calculated using Arrhenius equation as follows  \n\n$$\nI\\!\\left(T\\right)\\!=\\!\\frac{I_{0}}{1\\!+A\\mathrm{e}^{-E_{\\mathrm{b}}/\\left(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\right)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $I(T)$   and   $I_{0}$   are the PL intensities at   $T$  and   $0\\;\\mathrm{~K~}$  ,  respectively,  A  is a constant for the same host, and   $k$  is the  Boltzmann constant   $(8.619\\;\\times\\;10^{-5}\\;\\;\\mathrm{eV}\\;\\;\\mathrm{K}^{-1})$  ).  The calcu- lated   $E_{\\flat}$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  glass,   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bBr}_{3}@P S}$  , and   $\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3}@$  PC are in accord with that of bare   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs in solution,  but over four times larger than the bulk value, benefited from  the good dispersion and surface pass iv ation from matrices.  Notably, these larger differences between   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{t}}$   can enable  the effective formation of exciton, which implies a higher  possibility of trapping in radiative state rather than escaping or  recombining non radiative ly.  \n\n# 3. Encapsulation Methods  \n\nVarious encapsulation methods have been developed based  on the special characters and formation mechanism of  PQDs. In this section, according to the way to finish encapsulation process, we have divided these methods into four  parts as sol–gel method, template-assisted method, physical  method, and micro encapsulation. Specially, we put emphasis  on the essence of these methods and give some examples to  explain the corresponding effectiveness. In general, a part of  these common encapsulation methods added into the precursors can act as the templates taking part in the formation  of PQDs via a quick and short nucleation process followed  by a relatively slow and long growth process. Others may  grow new shells or layers on the synthesized PQDs via hotinjection method or ligand-mediated precipitation method  and so on.  \n\n# 3.1. Sol–Gel Method  \n\nSol–gel method is a wet-chemical technique  for synthesizing  bulk solid materials from small molecules called as precursors.  Recently, this method has been extended to fabricate a series of  protective layer for PQDs including monoacidic oxides of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$    and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  , binary oxides of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}/\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   and inorganic polymers  of ceramic successfully. Specially,   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   is a good encapsulation  material for PQDs due to its stability against environmental  and transparent characteristics. The   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   composites  can be synthesized by slowly hydro ly zing the organo silicon  capping agent in situ, possessing excellent PL properties with  a narrow line width and high PLQYs. Meanwhile, other oxides  synthesized by this way are effective encapsulation materials.  Yoon et  al. synthesized the PQDs  $@$  ceramic by simply using  liquid poly silo x an es (PSZ) precursors and a small amount of  water under vacuum.  The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs with a tightly  coated  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell were also synthesized by titanium precursors  (titanium butoxide (TBOT), followed by a calcination process at   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  .  \n\nHere, we put   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   an example to understand encapsulation of  PQDs via sol–gel method. Usually, there are two necessary conditions as precursors and proper content water. Traditionally, the  common precursors are tetra ortho silicates or tetra a lk oxys i lanes,   ${\\mathrm{Si}}({\\mathrm{OR}})_{4}.$  , such as tetra ethyl ortho silicate (TEOS,   $\\mathrm{Si}(\\mathrm{OC}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5})_{4})$  ,  tetra methyl ortho silicate (TMOS,   $\\mathrm{Si}(\\mathrm{OCH}_{3})_{4})_{3}$   or amino prop yl­ trie th oxys i lane (APTES), and polyhedral oligomeric s ilse s qui ox a ne  (POSS).  With proper content of water, hydrolysis reaction  can happen leading to formation of silanol groups; a subsequent condensation is associated with formation of 1D, 2D, or  3D networks, after a while, and a homogenous composition can  be obtained. Then, the three processes as the colloidal solution  (sol), the gel-like network, and the polycondensation (gel) are  depicted by following reactions  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{-SiOC_{2}H_{5}+H_{2}O\\to-S i O H+C_{2}H_{5}O H}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{-SiOH}+\\mathrm{-SiOC}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Si}-\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{Si}+\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5}\\mathrm{OH}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{-SiOH+-SiOH\\,{\\rightarrow}-S i O S i+H_{2}O}\n$$  \n\nHowever, PQDs are extremely sensitive to water and alcohols.  Recently, many effective modified sol–gel processes were developed to solve the contradiction between the hydrolysis and  highly efficient PL of PQDs.  \n\nOne-pot approach for encapsulation via   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   is developed  as illustrated in  Figure   2 a. Sun et al. mixed   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  , OA, OAm,  and APTES in a water-free octadecene (ODE), following a hotinjection method to synthesize PQDs. Then, the trace amount  of water vapor was introduced to allow a hydrolysis reaction,  finishing the formation of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  . The transmission electron  microscope characterizations indicated that PQDs were  embedded in\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
