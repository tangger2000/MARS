Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

Leyden,  Pangpang Wang, Morgan Auffray, Takashi Fujihara, Toshinori Matsushima,  Jin-Wook Lee, Sung-Joon Lee, Yang Yang, and Chihaya Adachi\\*  \n\nsolar power conversion and long-term  stability.  \n\nExcess/unreacted lead iodide   $(\\mathsf{P b l}_{2})$   has been commonly used in perovskite  films for the state-of-the-art solar cell applications. However, an understanding of intrinsic degradation mechanisms of perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  containing unreacted   $\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}$   has been still insufficient and, therefore, needs to  be clarified for better operational durability. Here, it is shown that degradation  of PSCs is hastened by unreacted   $\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}$   crystals under continuous light illumination. Unreacted   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   undergoes photo decomposition under illumination,  resulting in the formation of lead and iodine in films. Thus, this photodecomposition of  $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   is one of the main reasons for accelerated device degradation. Therefore, this work reveals that carefully controlling the formation of  unreacted  $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   crystals in perovskite films is very important to improve device  operational stability for diverse opto-electronic applications in the future.  \n\nExcess   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals are often observed  in CsFAMA films as evidenced by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images  and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns.   Photo decomposition  (photolysis)  of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   was reported by Dawood et  al.   Schoonman suggested that the photolysis  of lead halide is a possible reason for the  instability of hybrid per ovsk ites.  Thus,  the presence of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals in films is a  potential source of perovskite's instability.  However, how   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals affect longterm stability of per ovsk ites like CsFAMA  under continuous light irradiation has  been rarely studied  and, therefore,  \n\nOrganic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  are one of the most promising technologies for solar energy  harvesting. The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE)  of PSCs has quickly climbed to   $25.2\\%^{[1]}$   since the first discovery of PSCs in 2009 by Miyasaka et  al.  To reach this  high efficiency, “mixed” per ovsk ites with different anions   $\\mathrm{(I^{-}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$  ) and cations [methyl ammonium   $\\left(\\mathrm{MA^{+}}\\right)$  , formamidinium   $\\left(\\mathrm{FA^{+}}\\right)$  , and alkali metals, such as   $C s^{+}$  ,  $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathsf{R b^{+}}]$    have been employed in PSCs.  Besides high PCE, high  operational stability is important for commercialization.   Among reported mixed per ovsk ites, cesium containing triple  cation mixed per ovsk ites (CsFAMA) with the composition of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.05}(\\mathrm{FA}_{1-x}\\mathrm{MA}_{x})_{0.95}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{1-y}\\mathrm{Br}_{y})_{3}$   is known to have excellent  \n\nthe clarification of basic degradation mechanisms is needed to  further improve the stability of PSCs.  \n\nBased on the above considerations, here we investigated the  influence of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  crystals on the device performance as well  as long-term stability and related degradation mechanisms in  CsFAMA-based PSCs. We fabricated PSCs using three kinds  of different precursor solutions having different concentrations of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . We found that unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals tend to  form in films when the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   concentrations in precursor solutions increase. The PCEs of all PSCs were similar and were not  strongly correlated with the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   content. Furthermore, solutions with higher concentrations of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   produced PSCs that  had accelerated degradation. This degradation could be related  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/b3626fe925aba45a5eb770ebab93e3c64c500ca8d64cac5c65e5e093d5ecccd2-1727127217.jpg)  \nFigure   1.   Unreacted  $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   crystals were formed in some of CsFAMA-based perovskite films as a result of morphological and structural characterization.  a–c) Top-surface SEM images of a) S-1, b) S-2, and c) S-3 films. d–f) XRD patterns of d) S-1, e) S-2, and f) S-3 films. g) PSC structure and h) statistics  of 16 PCE values of each device structure measured in forward and reverse scans. i)  $J^{-V}$   curves of our champion PSC fabricated from the S-2 solution.

Finally, by choosing an appropriate   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  concentration that reduced the formation of   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   crystals in  resulting films, we achieved robust PSCs without any drop of  PCE for  $520\\;\\mathrm{h}$   under continuous light irradiation.  \n\nPerovskite films were deposited from a precursor solution which was prepared by mixing   $1.10\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$   of form amid in i um  iodide (FAI),   $0.2~\\mathrm{~M~}$   of methyl ammonium bromide (MABr),   $0.08\\mathrm{~M~}$   of cesium iodide (CsI),   $1.12\\mathrm{~M~}$   of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , and   $0.2\\mathrm{~M~}$   of lead  bromide   $\\left(\\operatorname{PbBr}_{2}\\right)$  . We used two additional precursor solutions  with increased molar concentrations of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   (1.15 and   $1.18~\\mathrm{M}$  ).  Hereafter, CsFAMA films fabricated from the  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   solution concent rations of 1.12, 1.15, and   $1.18~\\mathrm{M}$   are called S-1, S-2, and S-3.  \n\nFigure   1 a–f shows SEM images and XRD patterns of CsFAMA  films fabricated with different   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   concentrations. It can clearly  be seen in these figure (see Figures S1–S3, Supporting Information for magnified images) that unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals are formed  on S-3 films. From the XRD patterns, an additional peak at   $12.5^{\\circ}$  was observed in S-3 films, which was assigned to the   $(0\\;0\\;l)$   plane  of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals.  All the other peaks originated from the  cubic perovskite structure (Figure 1d–f) .  This may suggest that  the white particles in Figure 1c are  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals.  \n\nNext, we fabricated an initial batch of planar PSCs with S-1,  S-2, or S-\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
