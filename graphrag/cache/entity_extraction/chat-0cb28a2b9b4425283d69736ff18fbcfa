CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The \n\n  $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})$   and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})$   powders were obtained by annealing \n\n  $\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})_{2},$   respectively, in a vacuum oven at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for  $24\\,{\\sf h}$  .  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The planar inorganic PSCs were fabricated with  the structure   $\\mathsf{F T O}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}/\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}/\\mathrm{,}$  Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. FTO-based glass  substrate was cleaned sequentially with water, acetone, iso prop an ol  alcohol, and ethanol and then treated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min.  Then the substrates were treated under UV-Ozone for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$   to form  a hydrophilic surface.   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   layers were prepared by a chemical bath  deposition method according to this previously published works. The  $\\mathsf{F T O}/$  Glass substrates were placed in a glass container filled with a solution of \n\n  $4.5\\;\\mathsf{r n L}$   titanium chloride and  $200\\,\\mathsf{m L}$   ultrapure water in a  $70\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   lab oven for \n\n  $\\sf{T h}$   to deposit the  $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   layers. The substrates were rinsed with deionized  water to clean them and annealed for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$   at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   on a hotplate.  After cooling to room temperature, the   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}/\\mathsf{F T O}_{I}$  glass substrates were  treated by UV-Ozone treatment for   $20\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  .   $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$  perovskite layers  were formed by spin-coating the perovskite solutions with and without  DMSO adducts at 1000 rpm for   $\\;]0\\;s$   and then at 4000 rpm for   $45\\ s$   while  dripping   $\\mathsf{I50~m L}$   chl oro benzene onto the substrate between 14 and   $\\mathsf{T6~s}$  into the second spinning step.

The   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   inorganic perovskite solution without DMSO adducts was  dissolved with   $0.2338\\,\\mathrm{~g~}\\,{\\sf C s l}$     $(99.99\\%$  , Xi’an Polymer Light Technology  Corp.),  $0.2075\\mathrm{~g~}\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$     $(99.99\\%$  , Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), and   $0.1652\\ \\mathsf{g}\\ \\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$     $799.99\\%$  , Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) into   $1~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   $\\mathsf{v}/\\mathsf{v})$   to prepare a   $0.9~\\mathrm{M}$   solution.  After the spin coating, the films were heated on a hotplate at  $200~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  10 min. To prepare a Spiro-OMeTAD solution,   $90~\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}$  of   ${}^{2,2^{\\prime},7,7^{\\prime}}$  -tetrakis  ( N ,  N -di-p meth oxy phenyl amine)  ${\\mathfrak{9}}{\\mathfrak{,}}{\\mathfrak{9^{\\prime}}}$  -spiro bif luo rene was dissolved in  1 mL of chl oro benzene and mixed with   $36~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   4-tert-but yl pyr i dine (t-BP)  and  $22\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   Li-TFSI solution (bis-tri flu oro methane s ulf on amide lithium salt  dissolved in acetonitrile,   $520\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ m^{l-1}}$  ). It was spin-coated onto brown  perovskite film at 5000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   to form an hole transport layer. Finally,  an   $80\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{nm}}$   thick gold layer was thermally evaporated as a top electrode  using a shadow mask to form a device active area of 9, 49, or   $100\\;\\mathsf{m m}^{2}$  . All  the fabrication steps for spin-coating inorganic perovskite films and SpiroOMeTAD films were performed in a glove box.  \n\nDevice  Characterization :  Surface  morph o logie s  and  crosssectional images of inorganic perovskite films were characterized  by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI,  SU-8020). Surface roughness es of the inorganic perovskite films were  characterized by an atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker Dimension  5000 Scanning Probe Microscope). Thermo grav i metric (TG) analyses  of the prepared   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})$   and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})$   complex powders were  performed using a TA Instruments SDT Q600   $(2~^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}~{\\mathsf{m i n}}^{-1}$   from room  temperature to   $100\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C})$   under nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction  (XRD) spectra were obtained using a D/MAX 2400 diffract o meter with  Cu Ka radiation (Rigaku). FTIR spectra were measured with a Bruker  Vertex 70. Photo luminescence (PL) (excitation at   $532~\\mathsf{n m}$  ) spectra were  measured using a FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd).  Time resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured with a  PicoQuant FluoQuant 300. Water contact angles were obtained using a  Data physics OCA 20. The transmittance spectra of inorganic perovskite  films were measured by a UV/Vis NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer,  Lambda 950).
