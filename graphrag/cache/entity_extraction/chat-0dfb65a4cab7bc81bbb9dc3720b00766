CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

In contrast, the internal photon-to-current efficiency spectrums for  the best   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device (Figure  5d) suggested that the  incorporation of OTG3 had little influence on the charge extraction efficiency of the PSCs. The integrated current density was  calculated to be   $15.87\\ \\mathrm{mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , in good agreement with the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   obtained from the   $J{-}V$  characterization. To investigate the  charge carrier dynamics in perovskite solar cells, we carried  out a transient photo voltage (TPV) analysis to characterize the  charge recombination lifetime in the PSCs (Figure  5e). The  fact that the rate of decay of the TPV was substantially slower  in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device (  $(\\tau=9.64~\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$  ) than in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   $(\\tau\\!=\\!5.93\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$   further explains the reduced charge recombination  and improvement of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   in the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG3\\PSCs}$  .  \n\nIn addition to its higher photovoltaic performance, the PSCs  based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   also exhibited better stability than those  based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   when kept in a dark cabinet with the relative  humidity (RH) less than   $10\\%$   at room temperature (Figure 5f).  The device based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   without any encapsulation still retained about   $85\\%$   of its initial PCE after being aged  for 30 days. Nevertheless, the PCE of the CsPbI 3 -based device  dropped rapidly, the device degraded completely after 3 weeks of  storage with the perovskite layer slowly changed to light yellow.  Besides, further experiment is conducted to reveal the device stability in a high-humidity condition. As illustrated in Figure S16  (Supporting Information), the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device also exhibits  a small PCE loss of   $16\\%$   after aging for 7 days in   $35–40\\%$   RH,  but the control one degraded in just 1 day. In addition, the device  based on CsPbI –OTG3 maintained   $88\\%$   of its initial PCE after  3  \n\n$200\\textrm{h}$   of exposure to light in dry air and was therefore much  more stable than the device based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   without an OTG  capping layer (Figure S17, Supporting Information).  \n\nIn summary, we first proposed a strategy to stabilize the black  phase of all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite that involved systematically controlling the distortion of the corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{[PbI_{6}]^{4-}}$    framework via a large steric effect associated with organic terminal groups. Theoretical calculations and experimental studies  demonstrated that the steric hindrance due to the organic  terminal groups could maintain the linearity of the   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}I{-}P b}$    bonds and thus suppress the octahedral tilting of adjacent   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   units in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$  . The phase transition resistance against  moisture or polar solvents was thereby significantly increased.  Moreover, organic terminal groups could also passivate the  surface electronic trap states via efficient coordination between  carboxyl ate moieties and under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   defects. The  result was an extension of the carrier recombination lifetime of  the perovskite absorber. By the modification of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite layer with OTG molecules, we achieved a stabilized PCE  of   $13.2\\%$   for the inverted planar PSCs, which is the highest  efficiency obtained by the all-inorganic PSCs with an inverted  structure. In addition, the stability of the optimized device in  an ambient environment was excellent and superior to that of  the pristine device. We believe that this work also provides new  insight into the phase-stabilizing mechanism of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite that will lead toward highly efficient and stable perovskite  solar cells. Further study should be done to investigate the  impact of organic terminal groups on the stability and photovoltaic performance of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells based  on other types of absorbers such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$  .  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The FTO-coated glasses were etched with zinc  powder and   $\\mathsf{I}_{\\mathsf{\\Delta\\mathrm{~M~}}}\\mathsf{H C I}$   to obtain patterned substrates.
