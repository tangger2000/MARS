Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a.

OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

In brief, ultrathin   $\\mathrm{La}_{0.9}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.1}\\mathrm{CoO}_{3}$  (LSC1) nanosheet arrays were in situ vertically grown on an  NF via spontaneous electrostatic adsorption effect which provided an excellent electrical attraction to active sites and rapid  mass transfer. The crystal phase and structure of LMN were  confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). All the  diffraction peaks of the   $\\mathrm{La_{0.9}S r_{0.1}C o O_{3}/N i}$   (LSC1/NF) synthesized can be well indexed as the perovskite structure without  the appearance of any impurity phases (Figure  S1, Supporting Information).  Rietveld refinement of the XRD  pattern further revealed that the LMN possessed a hexagonal  phase with an   $\\mathrm{R}.3\\mathrm{m}$   space group (Figure 1b), which was also  directly visualized in parallelogram bright-field scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) image comprised of observable  heavier cations and lighter oxygen. Specifically, SEM images  of the   $\\mathrm{La_{0.9}S r_{0.1}C o O_{3}/T i_{3}C_{2}T_{x}}$   MXene/NF (LMN) composite  revealed distinctive porous nanosheets with pore sizes of several nanometers (Figure 1c,d). As a comparison, the LSC1/NF  annealed at   $600~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   possessed interconnected sheets with hexagonal shapes that were vertically sitting on the surfaces of the  NF (Figure S2, S3, Supporting Information). Whereas the use  of sole   $\\mathrm{La(NO}_{3})_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Sr}(\\mathrm{NO}_{3})_{3}$   or   ${\\mathrm{Co}}({\\mathrm{NO}}_{3})_{2}$   precursor only created  rough chunk surfaces on the NF without any nanosheets, the   $\\mathrm{LSC1/Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  MXene formed the irregular nanosheets after  the introduction of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   MXene (Figures  S4 and S5, Supporting Information). Additionally, the morphology of vertically  distributed catalyst nanosheets changed with the variation in   $\\mathrm{pH}$   of the precursor solution (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Furthermore, TEM images verified the porous structure  of nanosheets (Figure  1e), HRTEM images demonstrated two  different lattice fringes with inter planar distances of 0.27 and   $0.19\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , corresponding to the (110) and (024) crystal planes of  LSC1, respectively (Figure 1f). Elemental mapping validated the  homogeneous distribution of all elements (La, Sr, C, and Ti) in  the LMN (Figure  1g). Overall, the perovskite/  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  MXene  nanosheet array on Ni foam were fabricated successfully, and  the mild fabrication conditions ensured that the catalysts could  be easily prepared on a large scale.  \n\n# 2.2.

For comparison, similar measurements for bare  Ni foam,   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   MXene and LSC1 were also performed. The  capacitance-corrected cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, polarization curves obtained from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and  corresponding Tafel plots were presented. The over potential   $(\\eta)$  demanded to deliver a current density of   $10\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   is usually  served as a reference to assess the effectiveness of electro cat alysts to satisfy the requirement of solar-to-fuels conversion. Note that   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   MXene itself showed no redox feature and  very poor activity toward OER in alkaline solution.
