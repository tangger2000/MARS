CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Then the MA gas was produced  by the reaction between NaOH and MACl and served as the  conversion atmosphere. In this process, the MA molecules  diffused into the   ${\\mathrm{HALT}}_{3}$   film. This route can be explained  as the in situ organic cation exchange reaction shown below: \n\n  $\\mathrm{NH_{2}N H_{3}S n I_{3}\\Delta\\left(s\\right)}+\\mathrm{\\DeltaCH_{3}N H_{2}\\Delta\\left(g\\right)}=\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}S n I_{3}}$   $\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!(s)\\!+\\!\\!\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   $(l)$  . The favorable free energy change   $(\\Delta G)$   of  $-0.93~\\mathrm{eV}$   in the  dynamics can be utilized to explain this transition.   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  ,  which appeared at the beginning of this reaction, can be  released by further annealing. Further disposal of   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  should be carefully performed because this liquid is rather  dangerous. Based on the high-quality film, this regular  structure device achieved the champion PCE of   $7.13\\%$  , for   ${\\mathrm{MA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$  . This new method could help researchers achieve  smoother and pinhole-free 3D films based on the high-quality  1D structured film.  \n\nShao et  al. introduced 2-phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide  (PEAI) to form 2D/3D structured solar cells.  By mixing a  small ratio   $(8\\%)$   of layered perovskite   $(\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{SnI}_{4})$   with the 3D  perovskite, the device obtained a PCE of   $9\\%$  , due to low trapassisted recombination and small shunt losses. The 2D/3D  device exhibited better stability and kept   $60\\%$   of the initial PCE  after   $80\\textup{h}$   of exposure under   $20\\%$   RH atmosphere, while the  device based on 3D perovskite degraded entirely. Ran et  al.  introduced PEAI into the bulk of perovskite via vacuum evaporation.  After spin-coating form amid in i um iodide (FAI)  on  poly(3,4-ethylene di oxy thi oph ene):polystyrene  sulfonate  (PEDOT:PSS), they further evaporated PEAI and   $\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nI}_{2}$  . After  post-annealing, FAI, PEAI, and   $\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nI}_{2}$   form a (PEA, FA)  $|S n I_{3}$  bulk he t ero junction film. After 5 days in the glovebox, the bulk  he t ero junction device had only a slight decrement of shortcircuit current   $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\right)$  , while the reference device degraded at all  aspects.  \n\nTable   1.   Performance summary of tin-based halide PSCs. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/7d8902a4550bea12fba6f2b3268eae93f605d68bc8ea58302f3806d1e88a1235-1723835191.jpg)  \n\nRecently, PEAI has been utilized by Ning et  al. to form  2D–quasi-2D–3D tin halide perovskite film with the help of  ammonium th io cyan ate   $\\mathrm{{(NH_{4}S C N)}}$  . They employed grazingincidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to characterize the hierarchy structured perovskite (HSP) and the control sample.  In Figure 3c,e, the Bragg spots indicate strongly  preferential orientation for low-dimensional poly crystalline  films in the shallow surface at the incident angle of   $0.2^{\\circ}$  . While  the incident angle was increased to   $2^{\\circ}$  , 3D perovskite grains,  which existed in the depths of the film, were indicated by three  Debye–Scherrer rings (Figure 3d,f).

This  work provides an inspiring strategy to employ the structure  of low-dimensional perovskite in order to improve the performance and stability of PSCs.  \n\nChen et  al. introduced a semiconducting molecule called  poly[tetra phenyl ethene   $3{,}3^{\\prime}$  ‐ (((2,2-diphenyl ethene-1,1-diyl)bis  (4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis( N , N -dimethyl prop an-1-amine) tetra phenyl ethene] (PTN-Br) to the bulk of perovskite.
