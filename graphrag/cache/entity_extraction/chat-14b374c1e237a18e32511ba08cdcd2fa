CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

This work demonstrates the invaluable role of homochirality in designing 2D LIPFs. Such breaking down of barriers to exploring 2D LIPFs will inspire substantial efforts for  the continuous flourish ment of ferroelectric devices, PV materials, and op to electronic devices.  \n\nR -LIPF,  S -LIPF, and the racemic counterpart  rac -LIP were  obtained as plate-like orange crystals in HI solution containing  stoic hio metric amounts of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and the corresponding  R -,  S -,  and  rac -1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethylamine. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirms the phase purity of the as-grown crystals  (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Their chiral features were  then investigated by the vibrational circular dichroism (VCD)  measurement. The IR spectra of  R -LIPF and  S -LIPF crystals  are almost the same, while the VCD spectra are nearly mirror  images ( Figure   1 ), providing solid evidence for the enantiomorphic nature of   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF crystals. In contrast, the  rac -LIP  crystal shows no VCD signal, although the similar IR spectra  are observed. The measured VCD spectra of   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF  exhibits several pairs of relatively strong VCD signal   $(\\Delta\\varepsilon)$   at  1440, 1361, 1163, 1093, 1062, and   $956~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , which correspond  exactly to the specific infrared vibration peaks. From the calculated VCD and IR spectra (Figure S2, Supporting Information),  the VCD signal at   $956~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   can be attributed to the stretch  vibration of   $_{\\mathrm{C-C}}$   bond from the chiral center of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl ammonium cation in the structure.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/1343164d39f3686e0b611565f7b22d3a05b176d57e885c164b41f5ea352b5b34-1727122913.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Experimentally measured VCD and IR spectra for  R -LIPF,  S -LIPF, and  rac -LIP.  \n\nThe crystal structures in the three compounds can be  described as the 2D   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{3})_{2}\\mathrm{BX}_{4}$  -type layered perovskite structure, which is derived from the parent 3D   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   one.  Taking  single (100)-oriented layers from the 3D framework in the  3D   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   perovskite structure obtains the 2D   $\\mathrm{BX_{4}}^{2-}$   layers of  corner-sharing   ${\\mathrm{BX}}_{6}$   octahedra, which alternate with the   $\\mathrm{RNH}_{3}{}^{+}$  bilayers to form the 2D   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{3})_{2}\\mathrm{BX}_{4}$   perovskite structure.  In  the three compounds, the structures consist of corner-sharing   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$   octahedron layers separated by 1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethylammonium cationic bilayers ( Figure   2 ; Figure S3, Supporting  Information), similar to those of typical 2D   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{3})_{2}\\mathrm{BX}_{4}$   perovskites   $(\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{9}N H_{3}})_{2}\\mathrm{PbI_{4}}$   and   $(\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{5}C_{2}H_{4}N H_{3}})_{2}\\mathrm{PbI_{4}}$  .  Thus,  all the three compounds are 2D   $(\\mathrm{RNH}_{3})_{2}\\mathrm{BX}_{4}$   per ovsk ites. At   $293\\;\\mathrm{~K}_{z}$  ,  R -LIPF and  S -LIPF crystallize in the space group  P 1,  belonging to the chiral polar point group 1   $\\left(C_{1}\\right)$   (Table S1,  Supporting Information). The two en anti om orphic structures  have a mirror-plane relationship, in which the four independent  1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethyl ammonium cations show   $R$  and  S  config u rations in  R -LIPF and  S -LIPF, respectively (Figure  2a,b).  Their racemic mixture  rac -LIP, however, adopts a centrosymmetric   $P2_{1}/c$   space group of   $2/m$   point group, containing only  one 1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethyl ammonium cation in the basic unit  (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The 1-(4-chl oro phenyl) ethyl ammonium cations in all the three structures exhibit  ordered state. Interestingly, the cations connect with the inorganic layer not only through the commonly seen   $\\mathrm{N{-}H{\\cdot}{\\cdot}I}$  hydrogen bonds but also through weak   $_{\\mathrm{C-Cl\\cdotsI-Pb}}$   bonds  (average Cl ⋅⋅⋅ I distance of   $3.976\\textup{\\AA}$   in  R -LIPF) (Figure 2c), which  is significantly distinct from that found in other layered perovskites.  The polar  P 1 space group in  R -, and  S -LIPF indicates  that they should have spontaneous polarization. We thus calculated the spontaneous polarization with a point charge model  by assuming that the positive and negative charge are on the  Pb, N atoms and I atom, respectively. A same spontaneous  polarization of   $13.96\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at   $293~\\mathrm{K}$   was obtained for   $R\\cdot$  , and  S -LIPF, and zero polarization for  rac -LIP.  \n\nDifferential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC)  experiments  clearly show that   $R\\cdot$  - and  S -LIPF undergo a phase transition at around   $T_{{\\tt c}(R)}\\,=\\,483\\,\\mathrm{~K~}$   and   $T_{{\\tt c}(S)}\\,=\\,473.2\\,\\mathrm{\\boldmath~K}_{\\!s}$  , respectively  ( Figure    3 a,c).
