CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The average EQE of pristine and pristine/ABA PeLEDs is   $5.84\\%$   and  $8.21\\%$   with a  relative standard deviation of   $11.1\\%$   and   $10.6\\%$  , respectively. g) EL spectra of pristine and pristine/ABA PeLEDs, and h) the CIE coordinate of pristine/ ABA PeLEDs with the emission image in the inset.  \n\nby ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Figure S9,  Supporting Information), and the band alignment of the functional layers in the whole device is summarized in  Figure   4 a.  The thickness of PVK, perovskite emission layer, TPBi, and  LiF/Al layers is around 26, 40, 45, and   $100~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  , respectively, as  determined from the cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure  4b). The SEM image also shows a  more uniform film for pristine/ABA perovskite than pristine  perovskite (Figure S10, Supporting Information), as further  confirmed by the smaller surface roughness of   $0.79\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   as  compared to   $1.05\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   for pristine perovskite. (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The smooth and dense perovskite film  should benefit the suppression of current leakage,  while  the current density of pristine/ABA PeLEDs is slightly larger  than that of pristine PeLEDs, which can be attributed to the  increased carrier mobility of pristine/ABA films (Figure S12,  Supporting Information) deriving from the coupling between  perovskite phases. The PeLED performances in Figure  4c  show that the maximum brightness   $\\left({L}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\right)$   of pristine PeLEDs  is   $345~\\mathrm{cd}~\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   achieved at a bias of   $5.10\\ \\mathrm{V},$   which is enhanced  to   $513\\ \\mathrm{cd}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   for pristine/ABA devices. Meanwhile, there is a  dramatic increase of EQE from  .07% (pristine) to   $10.11\\%$   for  pristine/ABA PeLEDs (Figure  4d), consistent with this trend,  the maximum current efficiency (CE) enhances from 8.12 to  11.87 cd   $\\mathrm{A}^{-1}$   (Figure S13, Supporting Information). Besides, the  pristine/ABA PeLEDs maintain a decent efficiency with an efficiency droop of   $32\\%$   at around   $300\\ \\mathrm{cd}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  , which is obviously  superior to that of pristine PeLEDs with a severe efficiency  droop of   $54\\%$   (Figure 4e). The pristine/ABA PeLEDs also show  decent reproducibility with average EQE of   $8.21\\%$   obtained  from 20 devices (Figure 4f). The EL peaks of pristine and pristine/ABA PeLEDs are centered at  $486\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 4g), which are  consistent with their PL spectra, implying that the EL is merely  generated from the per ovsk ites. In addition, the pristine/ABA  PeLEDs show a narrowband emission with the full width at half  maximum (FWHM) of around   $25~\\mathrm{nm}$  , which enables an excellent color purity with Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage  (CIE) chromatic it y coordinate at (0.085, 0.233) (Figure 4h). We  also investigated the effect of different ABA concentrations on  the PeLED performances (Figure S15, Supporting Information).  It is found that the highest EQE is achieved for   $5\\%$   ABA incorporated PeLEDs. The performance will decline with further  increase of the concentration to   $10\\%$  , which can be ascribed  to the deterioration of perovskite crystal lin it y at high ABA  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/4db6c76950991995f9f53ce83a86ce69ce260c4bf693c880a891790623866089-1723836049.jpg)  \nFigure   5.   PeLED charge transfer characteristics: a) the working principle of quasi-2D PeLEDs, b) the PeLED capacitance–voltage ( C – V ) measurements,  and c) illustration of charge transfer (CT) in pristine and pristine/ABA PeLEDs.  \n\nconcentration (Figure S16, Supporting Information). Besides,  the effect of PVK thickness on the device performance was also  studied as shown in Figure S17 (Supporting Information), in  which the PeLEDs based on  $4\\:\\mathrm{mg\\:mL^{-1}}$   PVK show the best performance, while the EQE decreases at higher concentrations  due to the poor hole transport property for thicker PVK layers.  \n\nDuring the operation of quasi-2D PeLEDs, the injected  charges (i.e., electrons and holes) accumulate and recombine  at high-order perovskite due to the cascade energy structure  of quasi-2D per ovsk ites  ( Figure    5 a). Therefore, an efficient charge transfer between quasi-2D perovskite layers is  important to obtain high PeLED performances. In order to  study the charge transfer and recombination capacity of pristine and pristine/ABA PeLEDs, the capacitance–voltage   $(C{-}V)$  measurements were performed (Figure  5b). The capacitance  enlarges when the bias voltage increases, indicating that the  charges are injected into the PeLEDs. At higher voltage, the  capacitance will sharply decline due to the largely reduced carriers caused by the radiative recombination of mass electrons  and holes.  It is observed that the capacitance of pristine/ ABA PeLEDs decreases faster than that of pristine PeLEDs at  high voltages, indicating an efficient charge transfer for more  radiative recombination of electrons and holes in pristine/ ABA perovskite as illustrated in Figure 5c. To further verify the  efficient charge transfer for high radiative recombination rate,  we also carried out the electrical simulations of the PeLEDs  (Figure S18, Supporting Information). The result shows that  the peak radiative recombination rate for pristine/ABA PeLEDs  increases near   $40\\%$   to   $1.71\\times10^{22}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   from pristine PeLEDs   $(1.23\\times10^{22}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  ). Overall, we show that the efficient charge  transfer in pristine/ABA perovskite promotes the larger radiative recombination of electrons and holes, which contributes to  brighter pristine/ABA PeLEDs.  \n\nThe excellent spectra stability for PeLEDs is important for  their practical applications. However, it is a challenging issue  to achieve spectrally stable blue PeLEDs, probably due to ion  migration under high driving voltage and phase instability with  Joule heating.  The EL spectra of pristine and pristine/ABA  PeLEDs under different bias voltages from 4 to  $8\\;\\mathrm{V}$  are recorded  as shown in  Figure   6 a,b. It is observed that the EL intensity of  pristine/ABA PeLEDs increases when the bias voltage increases  from 4 to   $5\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{V}},$   and then declines at higher bias. Expectantly,  the EL peak position   $(486~\\mathrm{nm})$   and FWHM   $(\\approx\\!25\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   remain  unchanged, indicating a good spectral stability under different  bias voltages (Figure  6b). Similar to the situation of pristine/ ABA PeLEDs, the spectra of pristine PeLEDs also remain stable\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
