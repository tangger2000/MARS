CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The semilog plot of IPCE onset of a high efficiency device is depicted  in Figure   $2\\mathrm{b}$  , showing a sharp absorption edge and therefore  an   $E_{\\mathrm{u}}$   of   $13.7\\ \\mathrm{meV}.$   This   $E_{\\mathrm{u}}$   is fairly low in values reported for  high quality lead halide per ovsk ites, indicating a high degree  of electronic order in our quasi-2D perovskite films.  We  further investigated the crystal lin it y of the perovskite film by  X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure  2c). The XRD pattern shows  two dominant diffraction peaks at   $14.14^{\\circ}$   and   $28.50^{\\circ}$  , which  indicate that the quasi-2D perovskite film possesses large  crystal size and highly oriented crystal structure, agreeing well  with the results of SEM and FTPS measurements. We further  studied the light-harvesting ability of quasi-2D perovskite films,  which is an important factor affecting IPCE and photo current.  As depicted in Figure 2d, the quasi-2D perovskite film exhibits  a wide absorption range up to   ${\\approx}800\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , which is beneficial  for the utilization of low-energy solar photons. In the range  between 400 and   $700\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , additional exciton absorption peaks  stemming from the small   $n$   components are clearly observed,  confirming that our quasi-2D perovskite film has mixed-dimensional components.  To study the uniformity of the film,  the PL spectra are measured under two excitation configurations  of the front (perovskite side) and back (glass side). As shown in  Figure 2d, the front excitation leads to a Gaussian symmetrical  PL peak at   $768~\\mathrm{nm}$  , while the back excitation causes the extra  PL emission in the range between 620 and   $700\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  . The PL difference of the two excitation configurations suggests that in the  quasi-2D perovskite film the large  n  components are mainly  located at the upper surface of the film, and the small n components remains at the bottom (glass) side.  \n\nTo further investigate the film structure, we firstly analyzed  a cross-sectional quasi-2D perovskite film by an aberrationcorrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).  The contrast of high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM  image shows that the perovskite film is constructed of two parts  ( Figure 3 a). At the bottom region of the film, perovskite grains  with more than   $100\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   length grow along the direction perpendicular to the substrate. The   ${\\approx}180\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick, smooth and  pinhole-free perovskite layer with few grain boundaries covers  the top of vertical-oriented crystalline grains, which is consistent  with the observation of XRD and the surface-view SEM images.  Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps are shown in  Figure 3a to determine the content and distribution of the elements lead, iodide and carbon in the perovskite film. Compared  to the bottom region, the top area of the perovskite film shows  stronger signals of both lead and iodide but weaker signals of  carbon. The in homogeneous distribution of lead, iodide and  carbon across the perovskite film suggests that the   $[\\mathrm{PbI}_{6}]$   octahedra units distribute more in the top layer and organic cation  units are localized more in the bottom layer.  Grazing-incidence  wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement was also  performed to further probe the crystallography structure of the  perovskite film. GIWAXS measurements were performed as  a function of angle of incidence,   $\\alpha,$   which can provide depthsensitive information provided the layers are uniform enough  (which is the case for the films prepared here). For angles  below the critical angle   $(\\alpha<0.2^{\\circ})$   where the X-rays penetrate  only the top   $10~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   of the film or so, the 2D scattering patterns  resemble that of highly textured 3D-like (large  n ) perovskite,  with all peaks matching those seen in a 3D material. For angles  of   $\\alpha=0.2^{\\circ}$   and   $0.5^{\\circ}$   for which the X-ray beam penetrates fully  into the film, additional peaks appear which are indicative of a  highly ordered and oriented 2D phase (small   $n$  ). In particular  peaks at   $q=3.5~\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$   and   $q=7.0~\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$   are observed along the  in-plane scattering direction which can be assigned to (020) and  (040) reflections of   $n=2$   2D perovskite.  The appearance of  these peaks along the   $q_{x\\gamma}$   direction and not the  $q_{z}$   direction supports the vertical orientation of small $_{,n}$   components, which is  consistent with the STEM measurement results. The observation of peaks which are characteristic of 2D layered perovskite  features is also significant since previous reports of 2D perovs­ kite thin films have shown GIWAXS patterns that exhibit only  3D-like features,  suggesting that the small $\\cdot n$   ordering  in such materials may be rather disordered, lacking the period  layering of small $n$   components. Indeed, while other orders are  apparent in our sample based on the optical analysis, only the   $n=2$   perovskite exhibits periodic ordering. In general the 2D  GIWAXS data are consistent with the XRD shown in Figure 2c,  where the dominant peaks at   $14.14^{\\circ}$   and   $28.50^{\\circ}$   match the main  peaks which are indexed as (110) and (220) for 3D-like (largen )  per ovsk ites or as (111) and (202) for smalln  components. However, due to the highly textured nature of these films the  lab-based XRD measurements which only probe out-of-plane  scattering miss the key 2D peaks that appear in-plane, as  reported in the literature.  \n\nThe above information allows us to form a clear understanding of the unique structure of our quasi-2D perovskite  films, as illustrated in Figure  3c. Although the mechanism  is not clear, the introduction of 3BBAI actually induces the  oriented growth of small $_{,n}$   per ovsk ites perpendicular to the  substrate, following by the order crystallization of large $_{,n}$  components at top. The large $\\cdot n$   components with high crystallinity in the upper region are advantageous for low-energy\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
