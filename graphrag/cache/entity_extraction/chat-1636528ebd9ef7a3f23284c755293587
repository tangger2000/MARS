CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

$0.153\\mathrm{~mW~cm}^{-2}$  . Thus,  volatile-to-non volatile memory is transformed during the cumulative modulation with photonic pulses, which stimulates the  transformation of the memory retention from the short-term  memory to the long-term memory in brain’s plasticity. The light  wavelength-dependent EPSCs of the device are also investigated  in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), which increased from  3.7 to   $14.2\\;\\mathrm{nA}$   when reducing the light wavelength from 660 to   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  . These phenomena demonstrate the vivid imitation of  biological excitatory synapse.  \n\nThe effect of PPF is a well-known form of the short-term  memory effect, indexed as the increased ratio of the postsynaptic current amplitude between the two consecutive spikes  (Figures  S6 and S8, Supporting Information).  The PPF  effect emulated by two identical light pulses with fixed wavelength of   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   and light intensity ranging from 0.041 to   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~cm}^{-2}$   PPF ratio is summarized in Figure 3d. When  the photonic pulse is applied on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  -based photonic  synapse, the current in the p-type pentacene channel climbs  up with respect to the endurance of the illumination.  The  deeply trapped photo generated electrons inside the perovskite  QDs layer need to take a long time to decay.  After switching  off the light, positive shift of the post synaptic current can be  observed. After application of the second photonic pulse, higher  internal electric field stemmed from the more trapped electrons  induces a higher current level.  The PPF ratio fades with the  increasing photonic pulse intervals. The average characteristic  PPF ratio was found to be raised from 102, 107, 115 to   $130\\%$  as the intensities of the photonic pulses increasing from 0.041,  0.069, 0.129 to   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~cm}^{-2}$  . The increased irradiance facilitates the generation of photoelectrons inside the perovskite layer  which is attributed to the longer PPF decay time. The PPF effect  emulated by two identical light pulses with fixed irradiance of   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~cm}^{-2}$   and wavelength ranging from 660 to   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  PPF ratios is summarized in Figure 3e.  The average characteristic PPF ratio progressively increases from 107, 112, 117 to   $130\\%$   with the wavelengths decreasing from 660, 520, 450 to   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , respectively, suggesting that the memory formation  process can be accelerated by light with shorter wavelengths.  \n\nRepresentative parameters of the synaptic device character istics are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The energy  consumption for a single pulse event is defined as   $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}\\times t\\times V,$  ,  where   $I_{\\mathrm{peak}},$  ,  t , and   $V$   are the peak value of the EPSC, the pulse  duration time, and the pulse voltage, respectively.  Thus, the  energy consumption is reduced rapidly with the reduction of  the pulse duration time. Assuming that all the pre synaptic spike  width is identical, the average value of energy consumption for  transistor is orders of magnitude lower than those of currently  available synapse-inspired electronic devices. The comparative  analysis shows that the transistors have the potential to mimic  the low energy consumption of a biological synapse in a  human brain. The energy consumption for our photonic synapse transistor is   $1.4\\times10^{-9}$   J event − 1 , of which the photonic  pulse duration is 1 s. Furthermore, the result indicates a low  energy consumption of femtojoule level for this perovskitebased device can be achieved when the photonic pulse duration  reduced to   ${\\approx}0.1$   ms. The achievement benefits from the large  optical bandwidth and no electrical interconnect power loss,  which resembles the neural synapse at the physical level.  \n\nThe non volatile synaptic plasticity can be mimicked in the  perovskite device under the photonic/electric stimuli. Reliable  potenti ation–depression functions with different stimulus  are demonstrated in Figure 3f.  The train of photonic pulses  (  $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   wavelength,   $0.153\\,\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}}$   amplitude, 1 s dura- tion, 1 s interval) applied onto the device increase the EPSC  gradually. Consequently, negative electric pulses   $(-20\\;\\mathrm{V}$   amplitude,   $10\\mathrm{~m~s~}$   duration, 1 s interval) are applied to mimic the  electronic habituation in the device. The IPSCs obtained by the  electric pulse are varied with the pulse magnitude (Figure S7,  Supporting Information). As the trapped electrons are driven  back to the semiconductor layer, the current value gradually decreases with increasing pulse numbers as shown in  Figure 3f.  \n\nPerceptions and thoughts leave impressions that form memories in the brain. Application of the photonic pulses with different time intervals tuning the synaptic function from PPF  to PPD is illustrated in Figure 3g. The device exhibits PPF following high-frequency light stimulation at first 35 consecutive  photonic pulses with 1 s interval. Reduced rates of increment in  the EPSC curve are achieved and resulted in a steady state. The  facilitation switches into depression (current decrease) when  the pulse interval increases to   $10~\\mathrm{s}_{\\mathrm{i}}$  , which mimics the facilitation–depression transition in biological neural network.  The  facilitated conversion is involved with the charge trapping  mechanism in the perovskite layer.  For the light stimulation mode with longer time interval, light-generated electrons  partially released from the trap centers recombine with the  holes in the channel and finally reduce the current level. Hence,  the PPF-to-PPD transition through the photonic pulse train by  increasing pulse interval is successfully achieved to mimic the  important feature of biological behavior. In addition, different  numbers of photonic pulses are applied onto the device with  fixed intensity, wavelength, duration, and interval to further  verify the transition from STP to LTP. Sequential stimulation s  consolidate the memory which would not be easily erased. As  shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), retention  curves are recorded after removal of the consecutive photonic  pulses. The current value decays following the modified Kohlrausch equation, which has been described as the forgetting  function in psychology. The plotted relaxation constant with the  applied photonic pulses exhibited a clearly linear relationship,  which supports the transition behavior of synaptic plasticity in  our device.  \n\nIn order to relate the synapse performance to the confinement of the charge carrier before and after the light illumination, in situ KPFM of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}/$  pentacene film is  performed ( Figure   4 a). First, contact potential difference (CPD)  on the pentacene film before and after light illumination on a   $10\\times10~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$   area was investigated. Figure 4b (left 1) displays  an average surface potential value of   $184.48\\,\\mathrm{\\mV}$   for the initial state of the pentacene film.  Figure 4b (from left 2 to the  right) shows the surface potential of the penacene film after  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/9220a1d2a331334fbc5f9fa5c9c23a4b85ccc96c9b322d62ef0737615a0e3694-1727118698.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a)
