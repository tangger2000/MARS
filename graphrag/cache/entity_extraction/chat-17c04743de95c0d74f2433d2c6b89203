CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

As a result, the  cost and consumption of raw material   $\\left({\\mathrm{Li}}_{2}{\\mathrm{CO}}_{3}\\right)$   for LIBs were drastically  increased during the last ten years.   Own to its low price and element abundance, sodium gradually attracts the  academic attention and becomes a  promising substitute of lithium for nextgeneration commercial rechargeable batteries.  However, due to the large ionic  radius of   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   (1.02 Å) compared to   $\\mathrm{Li^{+}}$    (0.76 Å), fabricating a more beneficial  anode material aims to better   $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   inser- tion and extraction is a pivotal object for  sodium-ion batteries (SIBs or NIBs).   Very recently, alloying and conversionbased anode materials (e.g., Sb, P,   $\\mathrm{SnS}_{2}$  ,  and   ${\\mathrm{FeS}}_{2}.$  ) have been regularly investi  \n\nTransition-metal disulfide with its layered structure is regarded as a kind of  promi­ sing host material for sodium insertion, and intensely investigated for  sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a simple sol vo thermal method to synthesize a series of  $\\mathsf{M o S}_{2}$   nanosheets  $@$  nitrogen-doped graphene composites is  developed. This newly designed recipe of raw materials and solvents leads the  success of tuning size, number of layers, and inter planar spacing of the asprepared  $\\mathsf{M o S}_{2}$   nanosheets. Under cut-off voltage and based on an inter cal ation  mechanism, the ultrasmall  $\\mathsf{M o S}_{2}$   nanosheets  $@$  nitrogen-doped graphene composite exhibits more preferable cycling and rate performance compared to few-/ dozens-layered  $\\mathsf{M o S}_{2}$   nanosheets  $@$  nitrogen-doped graphene, as well as many  other reported insertion-type anode materials. Last, detailed kinetics analysis  and density functional theory calculation are also employed to explain the  ${\\sf N a}^{+}$  -  storage behavior, thus proving the significance in surface-controlled pseudocapacitance contribution at the high rate. Furthermore, this work offers some  meaningful preparation and investigation experiences for designing electrode  materials for commercial sodium-ion batteries with favorable performance.  \n\nDr. X.

Unfortunately,  the large volume variations and serious agglomeration of  the negative electrodes during the sodiation/des odi ation  processes give rise to a fast capacity decay. Although preparing nano-sized active components together with the  carbon assistant can relieve the above-mentioned defects  to some extent, the reported results are hard to fulfill the  commercial applications yet. On the other hand, a series of   $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$   and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   nano structures with inter cal ation mechanism also have been fabricated and employed for long-cyclelife sodium storage, but the limited specific capacities are  still unsatisfactory.  Thus, developing a novel strategy or  searching for a new kind of electrode material for NIBs is  still desirable.  \n\nMolybdenum disulfide   $(\\mathrm{MoS}_{2})$  , a typical 2D transition-metal  disulfide with large distance between stacked layers, was frequently investigated in both the LIBs and NIBs fields.   When an   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  -based anode is evaluated in  $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$   half-cells, intercalation and conversion reactions take place in order under a  discharge process. As demonstrated in Equations (1) and (2),  Na ions first insert into the   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   inter layers with the discharge  voltage varying from 3 to   $0.4~\\mathrm{V},$   and then   $\\mathrm{Na}_{x}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   fully transforms to metallic Mo and   $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{S}$   when the potential is below   $0.4\\;\\mathrm{V}.^{[20-22]}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/bf6ea085efa75830b12610bf6b75bd21c49d9faff4bc1c45c16f8d38befd447a-1727117732.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Schematic illustration of the synthesis procedures and morph o logie s of the DL  $\\cdot{\\mathsf{M o S}}_{2}@{\\mathsf{N G}}$  , FL $\\cdot{\\mathsf{M o S}}_{2}@{\\mathsf{N G}}$  , and U  $\\mathsf{I S.M o S_{2}@N G}$   (Scale bars,   $100\\;\\mathsf{n m}$  ).  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}+x\\mathrm{Na}=\\mathrm{Na}_{x}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}\\quad\\ \\left(\\mathrm{above}\\,0.4\\,\\mathrm{V},x<2\\right)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Na}_{x}\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}+(4-x)\\mathrm{Na}=\\mathrm{Mo}+2\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{S}\\ (\\mathrm{bellow}\\ 0.4\\ \\mathrm{V})\n$$  \n\nSeveral former works report that controlling charge/discharge voltage through a cut-off method to ensure an intercalation process is able to significantly improve the cycling  stability.  However, abandon of the conversion reaction  means a sacrifice of theoretical capacity as well as increasing  the operation voltage. Therefore, the promotion of the specific  capacity of insertion-type  $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   electrode becomes more urgent.  \n\nIt is generally accepted that during the discharge step,  solvated ions   $\\mathrm{(Li^{+}}$   or  $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  ) can be stored by most of anode materials via not only a diffusion-controlled process but also a Faradaic charge transfer existing at or near the surface/subsurface  of electrode material, that is, the so-called surface-controlled  process, meanwhile leading to an extra pseudo capacitance. Very recently, some groups demonstrated that decreasing the  size of nano-scale metal disulfides and expanding the distance  of interlayer are able to generate a considerable capacitive contribution, thus, resulting in an apparent improvement of specific capacities and rate performance.  On the other hand,  the electrochemical properties of pure   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$  -based materials  are often critically impeded by their poor electric conductivity.  To solve this problem, assembling   $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$   nano structures with  carbon nanotubes or graphene is proved to be an effective  approach.  For example, Yu et al. fabricated ultrathin   ${\\mathrm{MoS}}_{2}$  nanowall arrays anchored on carbon layer hybrids through an  in situ hybridization method and then tested them under a cutoff voltage   $(0.4{-}3.0\\ \\mathrm{V})$  ), which displayed an excellent reversible  capacity of   $120\\;\\mathrm{mArh\\;g^{-1}}$   at a high rate of   $10\\;\\mathrm{\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
