CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Subsequently, a liquid jet is directed toward the  inter digit a ted electrodes pasted on high-speed roller by the  electro spinning method. Then the solvent of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   precursors is being evaporated, leading to the nucleation and growth  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs. Due to the fast evaporation of the solvents  over the electro spinning process, the as-grown   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs  within the PVDF fibers can be expected to possess uniform  size and spatial distribution. For the two-step growth method  (Figure 1b),   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs are synthesized first. Then mixture  solution is prepared by adding   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs into PVDF solution. Finally,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers are obtained  by electro spinning onto the inter digit a ted electrodes pasted on  high-speed roller. Based on the above methods, the obtained  inter digit a ted electrodes with composite fibers were used to  construct the flexible PENG together with polymer (PMMA)  and polyimide (PI) tape (Figure  1c). The schematic diagram  of PENG structure in Figure  1d and the cross section of the  PENG in Figure 1e shows that about   $40\\mathrm{~\\upmum~}\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$    composite fibers films possess a clear interface between   $\\mathrm{Ag}$    electrode and PI tape, implying that in situ growth method can  yield homogeneous and compact piezoelectric fibers films. In  addition, the thickness of the device is about   $180~\\ensuremath{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$  , which  ensures the flexibility of that. The obtained PENG with the  overall size of   $1.50\\times2~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   after polarized in an electric field is  applied in life environments, for example, capture the mechanical energy during exercise (Figure 1f).  \n\n# 2.2. Characterization of   $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}@$  PVDF Composite Fibers  \n\nA typical SEM image of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   fibers using  in situ growth method under a low magnification is shown  in  Figure   2 a, implying the high-density and well-alignment  growth of the fibers with a uniform size diameter and a smooth  surface. Figure  2b,c is the typical closer observations of the  product under high magnifications, representing that the electrospun fibers have an average diameter of about   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . As  shown in the inset of Figure 2b, the optical images of the green  PL emission from the fibers can be observed under the illumination of   $365\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   ultraviolet (UV) light just after the electro spinning, implying the in situ growth of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs  within the PVDF fibers can be finished in just several seconds.  The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) reveals that  the NCs of the in situ growth method (the inset of Figure 2c;  Table S1, Supporting Information) and the NCs of the two-step  method (Figure S1 and Table S2, Supporting Information) are  composed of Cs, Pb, and Br with a mole ratio of about 1:1:3,  which are in agreement with the stoic hio me try of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  .  Figure  2d provides the representative TEM images of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fiber, revealing that the encapsulated NCs with the averagely size of about   $20~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   in diameter  are spatially distributed in the fiber body uniformly. Compared  with that synthesized by the two-step method, a large number  of NCs are distributed on the surface of the fibers, which are  out of protection of fibers. In addition, the NCs are distributed unevenly inside the fibers, stuck to each other and have  irregular shapes (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The in  situ growth of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs are spatially distributed in the  fibers body uniformly, which is caused by the fast evaporation  of the solvents over the electro spinning process. The measured spacing between the adjacent lattice fringes is   $0.30\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    (Figure  2e), corresponding to the distance of (200) crystal  planes of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  . The corresponding selected area electron  diffraction (SAED) (Figure  2f) reveals the single-crystalline of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NC naturally. Comparatively, for the composite fibers  of the two-step method (Figure S3a,b, Supporting Information), the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs contained within the fibers are not  uniformly distributed. The NCs take an irregular shape inside  with the diameter of about   $30{-}150\\:\\mathrm{nm}$  . Both the high resolution  transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image and SAED  pattern (Figure S3c,d, Supporting Information) verify that the  resultant NCs are the single-crystalline of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs.  \n\nFigure   3 a gives the typical XRD pattern of the obtained   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers. The detected main peaks  at   $15^{\\circ}$  ,   $21.30^{\\circ}$  ,   $30.40^{\\circ}$  , and   $38^{\\circ}$   correspond to the diffraction s  of (001), (010), (002), and (102) planes of perovskite   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  (JCPDS Card No. 54-751), respectively, confirming the formation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs within the polymer fibers. The detected  signals of aluminum in the XRD pattern come from the used  substrate. It is well known that PVDF is a semi-crystalline  polymer and consists of four different kinds of phases. Among  them, the   $\\beta$  phase is the desired one due to its ferroelectric  characteristics and non-negligible piezoelectric properties.  In  order to increase the ratio of   $\\beta$  -phase, a simple heat annealing  process is applied to the PVDF polymer.  Figure 3b gives the  XRD pattern of pure PVDF fibers without thermal annealing  process as a comparison.
