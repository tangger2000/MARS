Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals coated with zirconium oxide, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>Synthesis method<|>Modified method used to obtain CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsBr<|>Reagent<|>Cesium bromide, a source of cesium ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbBr2<|>Reagent<|>Lead bromide, a source of lead ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve CsBr and PbBr2, abbreviated as DMF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OAm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Intermediate product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals formed before ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>Precursor<|>Zirconium butoxide, precursor for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZrO2<|>Coating material<|>Zirconium oxide, used to coat CsPbBr3 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Room temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the synthesis was carried out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.4 mmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of PbBr2 and CsBr used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of DMF used to dissolve PbBr2 and CsBr)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.2 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OAm used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.6 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OA used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1500 rpm<|>Reaction condition<|>Speed of vigorous stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10s<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>60 µmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 used for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8500 rpm<|>Purification condition<|>Speed of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 min<|>Purification condition<|>Duration of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The modified super saturated recrystallization method is used to synthesize CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsBr<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>CsBr is a source of cesium ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbBr2<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>PbBr2 is a source of lead ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CsBr<|>DMF is used to dissolve CsBr<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbBr2<|>DMF is used to dissolve PbBr2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OA acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OAm acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Toluene acts as an antisolvent to induce the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>ZrO2<|>Zr(OC4H9)4 is the precursor for ZrO2 coating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZrO2<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>ZrO2 forms a coating on CsPbBr3 NCs to create CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Room temperature<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs is carried out at room temperature<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm is used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Centrifugation at 8500 rpm is used to purify CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: itrile, DMF,  chlo rob enzo l, methanol, and ethanol were all purchased from Wako Co.,  Japan. The ionic-liquid additive was synthesized by reacting   $\\mathsf{I0~m L}$   of   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{2}$   (  $40\\%$   in methanol, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Japan) and   $5~\\mathsf{m L}$   of acetic acid   $(99\\%$  , Aldrich) with   $50~\\mathsf{m L}$   of ethanol as solvent  in a   $250\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$   round-bottom flask at room temperature for   $^{\\mathrm{~2~h~}}$   with  stirring. The solvent as well as excess reactant was removed by vacuum  overnight, resulting in a colorless and viscous liquid. It was further dried  by solid desiccant (silica gel) and in vacuum oven for   $24\\,\\mathsf{h}$  .  \n\nDevice Fabrication : Devices were prepared on cleaned and patterned  FTO substrates. The NiO-based HELs were prepared by a spray pyrolysis  method:  a solution containing   $20\\,\\times\\,10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$   nickel acetyl ace to nate,   $3.75\\times10^{-3}$    m  magnesium acetate tetra hydrate, and   $1.25\\times10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$   lithium  acetate in acetonitrile/ethanol (with 95: 5 volume ratio) was sprayed on  clean FTO substrates (Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) at   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   using  air as a carrier gas. The NiO films were at subsequently annealed on a  hotplate in air at   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$  . The perovskite layer was deposited  by simple one step spin-coating method in a nitrogen filled glovebox.  The   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   precursor solution is comprised of   $1.2~\\mathrm{M}$   MAI and   $1.2~\\mathrm{~M~}$     ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   in super dehydrated DMF. The additives   $(\\approx]0–]5\\%$   MAAc,   $3{-}5\\%$    th io semi carb azide, molar ratio) were dissolved in DMF and added into  the perovskite solution just before spin-coating. The precursor solution  was spin-cast onto the substrate at 3000 rpm for   $2~\\mathsf{m i n}$  , followed by a  thermal annealing at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$  . The perovskite films for optical  and XRD measurements were prepared on clean glass slides with the  same procedure. The n-type contact layer   $(\\approx\\!80\\ \\mathsf{n m})$   was form by spincoating a PCBM solution   $(20\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$   in chl oro benzene) at 1000 rpm  for  $30~\\mathrm{s}$  . The subsequent deposition of very thin titanium oxide interlayer  was similar to the previous report.  Finally, a   $200\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   thick   $\\mathsf{A g}$   was  deposited under high vacuum   $\\left(<3\\times\\mathsf{10^{-4}}\\ \\mathsf{P a}\\right)$  . The solar cell was sealed  by UV glue coating on a cavity glass which covered between the front  FTO glass and the active films.  \n\nCharacterization : The top-view SEM images were obtained by using  a JSM–6500F field-emission scanning electron microscope. The crosssectional SEM was taken by SU8220 (Hitachi High-Technologies  Corporation), and EDS mapping images were measured from XFlash   $5060F Q$   (Bruker AXS). The cross-sectional observation samples were  prepared by IM4000 Ion Milling System (Hitachi High-Technologies  Corporation). The XRD was measured on Rigaku RINT-2500 powder  X-ray diffract o meter using   ${\\mathsf{C u}}\\ {\\mathsf{K}}_{\\upalpha}$  radiation. The UV–vis spectra were  measured on a Shimadzu UV/vis 3600 spectrophotometer. The  static photo luminescence spectra were measured by Edinburgh PLS  920 (Edinburgh Co. Ltd.). The time-resolved photo luminescence decay  was measured by Horiba Fluorolog-3 Time Correlated Single Photon  Counting system with excitation wavelength at   $460\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m}$  . The timeintegrated photo luminescence spectra of the samples were collected  with a miniature spectrometer   $({\\sf U S B}2000\\ +\\ {\\sf U V}.$  –vis, Ocean Optics).  For the excitation power-dependent measurement, the samples were  excited at   $540~\\mathsf{n m}$   (150 fs,  $80~{\\sf M H z})$  ) by excited at  $540~\\mathsf{n m}$   pulses from a  Chemeleon Compact OPO system. The excitation fluence on the sample  was in the range from 10 nJ   $\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   to   $2~\\upmu\\mathrm{J~cm}^{-2}$   per pulse. The densities  of the surface traps and bulk traps of each film were estimated by  analyzing the dependence of the TIPL on the pump fluence according to  literature.  The current–voltage characteristics were measured using a  solar simulator with standard air mass 1.5 sunlight (  $100\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  , WXS155S-10: Wacom Denso Co., Japan) under ambient conditions. The  $J^{-V}$  curves were measured by forward   $(-0.2$   to  $1.2\\,\\lor$   forward bias) or reverse  (1.2 to  $-0.2\\;\\lor$  ) scans. The step voltage was fixed at   $10\\ \\mathsf{m V}$  and the delay  time was set at   $100\\ \\mathsf{m s}$  .  $J^{-V}$  curves for all devices were measured by  masking the cells with a metal mask. Monochromatic IPCE spectra were  measured with a monochromatic incident light of  $\\rceil\\times\\rceil0^{\\rceil6}$   photons  $\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  in director current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki). The light intensity  of the solar simulator was calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell  provided by PV Measurements Inc. The stable photo current and power  output were measured by an electrochemical station (Solartron 1287).  The light-soaking stability was tested on a solar-cell light resistance test  system (Model BIR - 50, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., LTD) equipped with a Class  AAA solar simulator;   ${<\\!420\\,\\textrm{\\textmu}\\!\\mathrm{U}\\!\\mathrm{V}}$   light was cut off with an optical  filter, and a Keithley 2401 Source Meter for automatically recording the   $J^{-V}$  curves. The thermal stability was tested in an electronic constant  temperature/humidity chamber (THR030FA, Advantec Co., Ltd.) with  controlled humidity at  ${<}20\\%$   and temperature at  $85~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.W., F.X., and H.C. contributed equally to this work.
