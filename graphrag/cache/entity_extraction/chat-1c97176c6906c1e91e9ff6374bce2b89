CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Transmission electron  microscopy (TEM) image further reveals a bead-necklace-like  assembly of quasi spherical PrNPs (Figure 2c). A lattice fringe  with a   $d$  -spacing of   $2.75\\textup{\\AA}$   is observed, corresponding to the  (110) plane of   $\\mathrm{Ba}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.8}\\mathrm{Fe}_{0.2}\\mathrm{O}_{3-\\delta}$   per ovsk ites (Figure 2d).  The energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS) of PrNPs confirms  the presence of barium, strontium, cobalt, iron, and oxygen  elements (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The carbon  nanotubes (CNTs) were selected as conductive matrix to load   $\\mathrm{PrNPS}$   due to their excellent electrical conductivity and long  \n\nTo validate che mi sorption between PrNPs and LiPSs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed    3 a,b). The PrNP (110) surface renders a high binding   $-2.32\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   to   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{S}_{6}$  . In contrast, the CNT host only possesses a low binding energy of   $-0.61~\\mathrm{eV}.$   The anchoring function of PrNPs can be enhanced when considering the vacan-  $\\mathrm{PrNPS},^{[14]}$   resulting in a more distinct difference compared with CNTs. This demonstrates the strong anchoring  of poly sulfides onto a   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   promoter. The Li  O distance in   $\\mathrm{Pr}\\mathrm{NP}@\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{S}_{6}$  model is only   $1.764\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  , even smaller than that   crystal, indicating the formation of strong   $\\mathrm{Li-O}$   bond  (Figure 3a; Table S1, Supporting Information). Simultaneously, the   $S\\mathrm{-}S r$   distance in  the   $\\mathrm{PrNP@}$     $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{S}_{6}$   model,   $3.333\\,\\mathrm{~\\normalfont~\\AA~}$  , is   $10\\%$    more than that in the SrS crystal,   $3.032\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  .  The synergy between   $\\mathrm{Li-O}$   and   $S\\mathrm{-}S r$    bonding interactions endows PrNPs with  strong attraction to LiPS intermediates. This  is further convinced by the charge density  difference that electrons gain in the region  between Li and O, as well as S and   $\\mathrm{Sr}$   atoms  (Figure S3, Supporting Information).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/16c387df97363882686789534b2319a4b431924e081a41d592342e5ae1fb902f-1723832797.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   Structure of PrNP. a) XRD pattern, b) SEM image (inset: particle size distribution),  c) TEM image, and d) HRTEM image (inset: Fourier-transformed crystalline lattice and the  corresponding lattice spacing profile).  \n\nTo further demonstrate the strong adsorption of LiPS on   $\\mathrm{PrNPS}$  , a visual discrimina- tion test was carried out by dispersing   $\\mathrm{PrNPS}$    or CNTs in the   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{S}_{6}$   solution (Figure 3c).  After shaking   $1\\ \\operatorname{min}$   and resting   $6\\,\\textrm{h}$  , the  solution with PrNP promoters presents a  lucid coloration due to the chemical interaction between PrNPs and LiPSs.

Both  the DFT calculations and visualized adsorption tests clearly verified the strong chem- isorption of LiPSs on PrNP promoters.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/84c43307d89a8612b91d0a7a3d0d2c1f8f378cbec816bd6ecc7a1382c716b2e1-1723832807.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}_{6}$   binding to PrNP. b) Comparison of binding energies between  ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}_{6}$  and  $\\mathsf{P r N P}$   or CNT. c) Static adsorption of   ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}_{6}$   after  $6\\:\\mathsf{h}$  . d) Refined XPS spectra of Co 2p, O 1s, and   $\\textsf{S r}3\\mathsf{d}$   regions of   $\\mathsf{P r N P}$   before and after adsorption  of   ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}_{6}$   solution. e) Cyclic volt ammo grams of symmetric cells of CP,   $\\mathsf{P r N P@C P}$  , electrodes with and without  ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}_{6}$  , and f) potenti o static discharge profiles of   ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}_{8}$   solution at  $2.05\\;\\lor$   on   $\\mathsf{P r N P@C P}$   and CP substrates, respectively, and the insets represent precipitation of   ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}_{x}$  after   $\\approx\\!5000\\ \\mathrm{s}$  .

The  peaks at 779.5 and   $795.0~\\mathrm{eV}$   in pristine PrNPs are indexed as   ${C0}^{3+}$  , while 780.4 and   $795.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   are assigned as   ${\\bf C}{\\boldsymbol0}^{4+}$  .  Upon  interaction with   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{S}_{6}$  , the doublet of   $\\mathrm{Co}\\ 2\\mathrm{p}$   spectrum generally shifts toward lower binding energy, indicating the electron  transfer from   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{S}_{6}$   species to Co ions in  $\\mathrm{PrNPS}$  . This chemical  shift is attributed to the ox i diz ation of   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}\\mathrm{S}_{6}$  into intermediate  species since the high-valance ions propel the formation of thiosulfate/poly th ion ate groups.  \n\nDe convolution of the O 1s spectra of routine PrNPs yields  three peaks at 531.5, 530.6, and   $529.3\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   signifying hydroxyls  species   $\\left(\\mathrm{OH^{-}}\\right)$  , adsorbed oxygen species (  $\\mathrm{CO^{2-}}$   and   $\\mathrm{O^{-}}$  ), and lattice oxygen   $(O^{2-})$  , respectively.  Contracting to pristine O 1s  spectra, the chemical adsorption of   $\\mathrm{\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
