Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

Besides, the  presence of weak van der Waals gaps also deteriorates the stability of quasi-2D perovskite structure due to easy degradation  of perovskite structure upon exposure to different operation  conditions, such as continuous heat and light soaking during  PeLED operation.  Consequently, reduction of the van der  Waals gaps and strengthened interaction between quasi-2D  perovskite layers are very important to obtain well-performed  PeLEDs.  \n\nIn this work, we introduce a bi functional ligand of 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA) cation into the perovskite to  diminish the weak van der Waals gaps for promoting the coupling of quasi-2D perovskite layers via the bi functional group  of amino and carboxylic. The strengthened interaction between  coupled quasi-2D perovskite layers benefits an efficient energy  transfer intrinsically in the ABA incorporated perovskite films  for highly performed PeLEDs. Besides, we show that the ABA  can reduce traps states and thus non radiative recombination  loss by suppressing the metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$  in the perovskite film.  By optimizing the new type of quasi-2D perovskite, the blue  PeLEDs achieve high external quantum efficiency of   $10.11\\%$   and  a prolonged operational stability of   $81.3\\;\\mathrm{min}$  . Consequently, this  work contributes to evolving approaches for the realization of  highly performed and stable blue PeLEDs.  \n\nThe coupled quasi-2D per ovsk ites were constructed based  on the mixed-ligand perovskite of   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{x}\\mathrm{PA}_{2-x}(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3})_{n-1}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{4}$   $(0\\leq x<2)$   which is hereafter named as pristine perovskite. In  the pristine perovskite, the perovskite phases were redistributed  with an increase ment of high-order phases (e.g.,  $n=3$   phase) via  suppression of low-order phases (e.g.,   $n=2$   phase) (Figure S1,  Supporting Information). However, inevitable van der Waals  gaps are formed in the pristine per ovsk ites due to the spacer  organic mono ammonium cations, such as   $\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{PA^{+}}$  ,  which result in weak interactions between the quasi-2D perovskite layers ( Figure    1 a) and poor spectral stability (Figure S2,  Supporting Information). When the ABA is incorporated into  the pristine perovskite (denoted as pristine/ABA perovskite),  the weak van der Waals gaps can be diminished, and the interaction between perovskite layers is strengthened through the  bi functional group of amino and carboxylic of ABA (Figure 1b).  The close interaction of the coupled quasi-2D perovskite layers  will promote an efficient energy transfer between the perovskite  layers and thus enhance the radiative recombination rate of the  perovskite films as to be discussed later.  \n\nThe molecular structure of ABA is shown in Figure  1b,  which consists of amino, carboxylic acid, and phenethyl groups.  To analyze the interaction between ABA and the perovskite  layer (mainly the Pb-Br framework), Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed on ABA and ABA incorporated   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$   powder (denoted as   $\\mathrm{\\AA/PbBr_{2}}$   to rule out the  unexpected influence of other ammonium cations in the perovskite precursor. As shown in Figure 1c, the characteristic   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$  stretching vibration peak is located at  $1696\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   for ABA, which  shifts to a lower wavenumber of   $1688\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-1}$  for ABA/  $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  powder, attributed to the strong interaction between   $-\\mathrm{{COOH}}$  and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$   through sharing the lone pair electron on the oxygen  atom of   COOH with the empty 6p orbital of   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  .  Meanwhile, the characteristic peaks observed at 1583 and   $3483~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  for ABA can be ascribed to the scissoring and stretching vibration of   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$  , which shift to lower wave numbers of 1576 and   $3465~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   for ABA/  $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  , respectively, due to the interaction  between the   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   and the Pb-Br framework through hydrogen  bond.  To further confirm the interaction between the ABA  and the Pb-Br framework, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy \n\n (XPS) measurements were performed. The peaks at143.3 and \n\n  $138.4\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{eV}}$   for the pristine perovskite are assigned to Pb 4f signal,  which shift toward lower binding energy upon incorporation of  ABA (Figure 1d). The reduced binding energy indicates the lowered oxidation state of lead due to the electron donation from  oxygen, which well agrees with the FT-IR results. In addition,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/b22a0928a77e452b7268b2965063e8075109997e08e87d7ee6751994965861e7-1723836046.jpg)  \nFigure   1.   Schematic illustration of a) pristine, b) pristine/ABA perovskite, and the interaction between neighboring perovskite layers in pristine/ABA  perovskite. c) FT-IR spectroscopy of ABA and ABA incorporated   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   powder.

DFT calculations of  g) pristine and   $\\mathsf{h}$  ) ABA incorporated per ovsk ites, and their deformation charge density distributions.  \n\nthe signals of metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   were observed in the pristine perovskite film, as evidenced by the two weak peaks located at 141.1  and   $136.2\\ \\mathrm{eV}.^{[56]}$   In contrast, no metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   peak is found in  pristine/ABA perovskite film, which indicates that the formation of metallic  $\\mathrm{Pb}$   is suppressed. Since the presence of metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   species was reported to closely relate with halide vacancies  in the perovskite lattice,  the suppression of metallic Pb for  ABA incorporated perovskite film suggests that the bromide  vacancies are effectively passivated by ABA. Moreover, the O  1s signals of ABA and the incorporated perovskite films were  recorded to further verify the interaction of oxygen atom and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   (Figure 1e,f). As shown in the spectra, the observed broad  peaks can be de convoluted into two peaks at 531.4 and   $533.1\\,\\mathrm{eV},$  which are assigned to oxygen from the components of   $\\mathrm{C=O}$  and   $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$   in carboxylic acid group, respectively.  It is found  that the peak intensity of   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   and   $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$   declines after ABA  incorporation in the perovskite due to the weakened   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   and \n\n  $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$   bonds, which indicates both of the oxygen atoms from \n\n  $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$   and  $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$   have strong interactions with   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  . Besides, the  density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to  further theoretically reveal the interaction between ABA organic  spacer and quasi-2D per ovsk ites (Figure 1g,h). It is found that  the ABA can coordinate the unsaturated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   through the coordination bond of   $\\mathrm{P\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
