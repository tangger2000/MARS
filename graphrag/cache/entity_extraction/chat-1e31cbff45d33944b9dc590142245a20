From the viewpoint  of reaction media, the inter facial photo thermal evaporationelectro catalytic system exhibited tri-phase interfaces of vapor/ air/gas   $(\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   and/or   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}^{\\cdot}$  ). As shown in Figure  5e,f; Figure  S19  (Supporting Information), the convection above the catalyst  surface is close to 0 without solar illumination. In this case,  the generated   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   escaped the surface mainly by diffusion in the air   $(D{\\approx}2\\times10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  , which was very slow. When inter facial solar evaporation was involved, due to the  temperature and humidity differences between the evaporation surface and ambient environment  the convection above  the catalyst surface was dramatically enhanced, which significantly facilitated the mass transportation and escape of the  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/6ae1ae4a20529018b3c2650faa047f841e1052bd498019a3d748b821593b10e9-1727105666.jpg)  \nFigure   5.   Inter facial solar evaporation induced overall water splitting performance. a) Schematic illustration of the biphase and triphase systems with  water steam/solid electro catalysts/gas at different locations. b, c) OER polarization curves and the corresponding Tafel plots of catalysts placed at  different locations in an  $\\mathsf{O}_{2}$  -saturated 1 m KOH solution. d) Chrono potenti ome try curve of water electrolysis using Ni foam//Ni foam, LMN//LMN as  both anode and cathode at a constant current density of   $10\\;{\\mathsf{m A}}\\;{\\mathsf{c m}}^{-2}$   in 1 m KOH. e,f) The liquid and air convection and the change in   $\\mathsf{O}\\mathsf{H}^{-}$   concentration at the water-air interfaces under solar illumination simulated by COMSOL multi physics.  \n\ngenerated gas from catalyst surfaces, enhancing the kinetics of  the catalytic reaction. In addition, inter facial solar evaporation  also induced the   $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$   enrichment at the water-air interfaces  (i.e., around the catalyst surfaces) due to the localized water  removal, which also benefited the electro catalytic performance  of the LMN located at the air-water interfaces. Therefore, by  involving inter facial solar evaporation, the induced higher temperature, faster convection and gas removal, as well as localized   $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$   enrichment in the vicinity of the catalyst surfaces were all  conducive to the electro catalytic performance of the inter facial  LMN.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, a highly efficient integrated inter facial photothermal evaporation-water electrolysis system was successfully constructed to boost the electro catalytic water splitting.  2D   $\\mathrm{La_{0.9}S r_{0.1}C o O_{3}/T i_{3}C_{2}T_{x}}$   MXene he t ero structure on Ni  foam (LMN) simultaneously acted as the photo thermal solar  evaporator and also an efficient electro catalyst for both OER  and HER. The enhanced catalytic performance of the LMN  under solar illumination is benefited from the promoted electron transfer within the heterogeneous catalyst and localized  inter facial effects induced by inter facial solar evaporation as  observed both experimentally and theoretically. DFT calculations disclosed that the loading of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   MXene on the surface of   $\\mathrm{La}_{0.9}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.1}\\mathrm{CoO}_{3}$   can lower the energy barrier for faster  electron transfer to facilitate   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   release by regulating electronic  structure, thereby effectively boosting OER performance in  the alkaline electrolyte. COMSOL multi physics simulations  demonstrated that the promoted inter facial water electrolysis  performance under 5 sun illumination (a low over potential of   $279~\\mathrm{mV}$   and Tafel slope of   $74.3\\mathrm{~}\\mathrm{mV}\\mathrm{~dec}^{-1})$   at   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   was  attributed to the enhanced convection above the catalyst surface for gas removal, as well as enriched   $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$  near the catalyst surface induced by inter facial solar evaporation. This work  paves the way for designing efficient per ovsk ites-based electrocatalysts to replace precious-metal-based electro catalysts and  provides a promising perspective for the integrated inter facial  photo thermal-water electrolysis system for sustainable energy  conversion.  \n\n# 4.
