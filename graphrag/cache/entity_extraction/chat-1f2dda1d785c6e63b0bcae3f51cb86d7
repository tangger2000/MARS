CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

The photo generated electron/hole pairs are split at the   $\\mathrm{{\\small PMMA}/C s P b B r}_{3}$   interface by  the external electric field. The separated charge carriers could  be further arrested by QDs to form an additional internal electrical field. Then   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   ions can be more effectively driven to the  Ag anode under an enhanced field. Meanwhile, more   $\\mathrm{Ag^{+}}$   is  repelled toward the ITO cathode to be reduced into   $\\mathrm{Ag}$   cluster.  Spontaneously, more released   ${\\mathrm{V_{Br}}}^{+}$   and formation of Ag clusters will accumulate in the perovskite to form more conductive  channels.  \n\nWe further demonstrate programmable FET prototypes  which display similarity to traditional flash memory via  employing   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based RRAM as a switching gate for  the transistor on the flexible substrate. The memory effects of  RRAM-gated FET are obtained by modulating the resistive states  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based RRAM. Schematic illustration of the  RRAM-gated FET is displayed in  Figure   5 a. First, the transfer  characteristics of   $\\mathrm{p}$  -channel pentacene-based FET were swept  independently (Figure 5b). The transistor exhibits the mobility   $(\\mu)$   of   ${\\approx}0.3\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , threshold voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right)$   of   $-0.70\\;\\mathrm{~V},$    and ON/OFF current ratio of   $\\approx\\!10^{3}$  . The   $I{-}V$  characteristic of  the RRAM-gated transistor is then studied following separately  setting the RRAM to the LRS and HRS (Figure 5c). In order  to avoid the RRAM to be reset back to the HRS state during  the transfer curve scanning process, the gate voltage is set to  be  $-2\\;\\mathrm{V},$   which is smaller than the SET voltage of RRAM in the  dark. When the RRAM device is kept in HRS, the   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   of the  RRAM-gated FET exhibits an obvious negative shift to   $-0.97\\mathrm{~V~}$    compared with individual FET. The more difficult turn-on  behavior is related to the higher series resistance originated  from high-resistance-stated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based RRAM. After  the RRAM device is set to LRS, the   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   of the RRAM-gated FET  is measured to be  $-0.76~\\mathrm{V}$   which decreases around   $94.29\\%$   in  current value compared with the individual transistor. Therefore, different memory states of the RRAM device could effectively modulate the channel conductivity of the FET. The differences of the gate coupling from HRS and LRS of the resistive  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/9f13e9ad8ecd905d58239aecc9c60e28e8c596112072b5a770e047d47be5a222-1727117052.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $\\mathsf{p}$  -channel FET device.

After exposure to UV light with a wavelength of   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  , the  programed state  $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   of the RRAM-gated FET is further reduced  to   $-0.41\\;\\mathrm{V}.$  . Thus, variable memory states can be achieved in  photonic RRAM-gated FET via photo regulation. As shown in  Figure 5d, after reading by the sweeping of   $V_{\\mathrm{CG}}$   from 0 to   $-3\\mathrm{~V~}$  at a   $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$   of   $-3\\;\\mathrm{V},$   the   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   of the RRAM-gated FET can be maintained for 100 cycles of alternative voltage pulses with negligible fluctuation. Meanwhile, the bending test is carried out by  bending the samples with a curvature of   $15~\\mathrm{mm}$   radius. Almost  no degradation of   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   is observed in Figure 5e for 500 bending  cycles. Thus, the combination of RRAM with FET and photomodulation is promising to achieve successful logic operation.  \n\nIn summary, we first introduce a photonic RRAM based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs, a typical all-inorganic perovskite material with  outstanding op to electronic properties and preferable stability.  The pristine inorganic perovskite QD-based RRAM is more competitive compared with HOIP-based RRAM due to its high reproducibility and stability. Moreover, larger ON/OFF ratio and multilevel data storage were obtained by a combination of bias voltage  and photo irradiation, and the stored data can be encrypted by  UV light. In addition, FE-SEM and EDX analyses were utilized  to study the switching mechanism of all-inorganic perovskite  QD-based RRAM. From the analysis of elemental distributions  in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs’ film at LRS, formation and annihilation of  metal conductive filament and   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   ion vacancy filament driven  by the external electric field and light irradiation can lead to pronounced resistive switching effects. The photonic RRAM-gate  FET, which displays analogous functions of flash memory, is further demonstrated by coupling   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based RRAM with  the p-channel transistor. The synergistic effect of electrochemical  metal liz ation and valence change in all-inorganic perovskite QDbased photonic resistive memory may help gain insight into  practical logic circuit application of perovskite materials.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe  authors  acknowledge  the  grants  from  Natural  Science  Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61601305 and 61604097), the  Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen  (Grant  Nos.
