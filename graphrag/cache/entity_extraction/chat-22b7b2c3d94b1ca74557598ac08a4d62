CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

When  the mass ratio of PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   are kept at 8, 6, 3, 2, 1.50,  1, and 0.80, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device is 25, 36, 87, 170, 21,  20, and   $15~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, indicating that the output of  PENG with the mass ratio of PVDF to  ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   to be 2 exhibits  the best one.

As  for the polarization voltage, the mass ratio of PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  is 2 and the electro spinning time is 1 min (Figure 5c).

In addition, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   has a tendency  to aggrandize with the increase of the number of cycles in the  cyclic stability curve (Figure 5e), which is caused by the charge  accumulation from the incomplete discharge during the cyclic  charging and discharging processes.

As shown in  Figure   6 a, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  PVDF composite fibers based PENG with in situ growth method  is only   $13~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   when the final velocity is   $1\\textrm{m s}^{-1}$   and the  output increases as the final speed increases until the velocity  reaches   $10\\;\\mathrm{m}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . Hence, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   reaches a maximum  of   $170\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at  $10\\ \\mathrm{m\\s^{-1}}$  . The output of the PENG is affected  by the frequency through many factors, including deformation recovery time, applied force and accumulated charge. As  shown in Figure 6b, the output of the PENG keeps  $170\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$    under the interference of frequency fluctuation, which is not  affected by the frequency of the applied force ranging from  0.30 to   $6~\\mathrm{Hz}$  . The mainly reasons are as follows. First, since  the factors including acceleration, final speed and impact time  of the linear motor are precisely controlled, the force applied to  PENG remains strictly unchanging when testing the frequency  characteristics. Second, in the low frequency range of  $0.3–6~\\mathrm{Hz}$  ,  the electrons in the external circuit have sufficient time to balance the piezoelectric potential. Finally, when the force along  the radial direction of the fiber is removed, PENG can quickly  return to the initial position. Therefore,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers based PENG can complete the task of collecting  and converting energy in different frequency ranges, greatly  expanding the application range.  \n\nThe output characteristics of PENG are affected to some extent  by the external load.
