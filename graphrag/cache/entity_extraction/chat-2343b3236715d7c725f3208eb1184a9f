OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.
