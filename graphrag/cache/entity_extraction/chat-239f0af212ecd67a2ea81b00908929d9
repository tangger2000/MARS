CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

As illustrated  in  Figure   4 a, the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered film exhibited more  efficient PL quenching than that based on single-layer   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  ,  indicating a stronger electron extraction capability from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  film. Figure 4b depicted the time-resolved PL spectrum of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films on   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL. The corresponding PL lifetimes were calculated  by the single-exponential fits to the time-resolved PL spectrum.  A relatively long PL lifetime of 8.6 ns was obtained  for the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film, while the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL-based   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film exhibited a shorter PL lifetime  (1.2 ns) compared to that with the single-layer   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (2.9 ns).  \n\nTable 1.  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/Z\\mathsf{n O}$   bilayered  ETL and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL under 1000 W   $m^{-2}$   air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G)  illumination. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/65aa3449c2bd02eacd12fba3627e6d2c589b79c22d9f98a84a81daea784d14f7-1727118555.jpg)  \n\nClearly, the favorable matching of cascade energy band between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL enables the photogenerated electron to be extracted from perovskite layer more  effectively.  \n\nWe also investigated the charge recombination of the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL-modified devices  using several characterization techniques, including light  intensity-dependent   $J{-}V$  measurement, transient photo voltage  (TPV), and transient photo current (TPC) measurements as well  as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  Figure   5 a  illustrated the power law dependence of the device  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   with incident light intensity   $U_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\propto I^{\\alpha})$  . Due to an inter facial barrier or a  carrier imbalance, the space charge limited solar cell will have  an   $\\alpha$  value of 0.75, whereas a device with no space charge  effects will have a power law relationship with   $\\alpha$  close to 1. The   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   device with an   $\\alpha=0.992$   does not appear to  be space charge limited, while the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   device has a smaller   $\\alpha$  value of 0.884. It suggested that the favorable matching of  cascade energy band between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayer  ETL enables the photo generated electron to be extracted from  perovskite layer faster without charges accumulation inside  PVSCs. On the other hand, the slope of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   versus the natural  logarithm of light intensity for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -modified solar  cell   $(1.20\\,\\,\\,K_{\\mathrm{B}}T/q)$   was smaller than that for the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -modified  solar cell (1.48   $K_{\\mathrm{B}}T/q)$  .

The smaller slope suggested that trapassisted charge recombination process was more effectively  suppressed by the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL.  \n\nTo further evaluate the effects of different ETLs on the  recombination dynamics of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs, we compared  the corresponding charge-recombination lifetime and chargeextraction time, respectively, by TPV and TPC measurements  (Figure 5b,c). The   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL modified devices  exhibited a longer charge-recombination lifetime   $(4.3~\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$   as  well as smaller charge-extraction time   $(0.36~\\ensuremath{\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}})$   relative to  that of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -based device (2.4 and   $0.45~\\ensuremath{\\upmu\\mathrm{s}},$  ), suggesting that  charge recombination was slower and extraction efficiency  was enhanced by the reduction in charge traps. These findings are in agreement with other reports indicating improvements in device interfaces and perovskite film quality are  critically important to improve the overall efficiency of  PVSCs.  \n\nEIS measurements were also carried out to investigate the  inter facial charge transfer properties in PVSCs.  Herein,  the EIS spectra were measured at an applied bias of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   with a  frequency range from   $1\\:\\mathrm{MHz}$   to  $1\\;\\mathrm{Hz}$   and  $10\\:\\mathrm{mA}$   AC amplitude  under illumination of simulated solar AM1.5 global light at   $100\\ \\mathrm{mW\\cm^{-2}}$  .
