CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The  $\\nu_{5}$  , which relates to the   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}/T a^{5+}}$   cation displacement and   $(\\mathrm{Nb,Ta})\\mathrm{O}_{6}$   octahedra tilting,  is found to become weakened in  intensity and broad in shape with increasing Ta addition. The  decrease in intensity is attributed to the lower polar iz ability  of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}~(2.82~\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}^{3})$   compared to that of   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$     $(3.10\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^{3})$  ,  while  the broadening may relate to the reduction in the correlation  length of displacements. This can be explained by the lower  electronegativity of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   (1.5) than that of   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$   (1.6),  where  the substitution of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   for   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$   will result in stronger ionic  bonding and compressed oxygen octahedron s, accounting  for the decreased correlation length of displacements. The  enhanced ionic bonding in the octahedron s also leads to lattice contraction as confirmed by X-ray diffract o meter (XRD)  patterns in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), where [020],  [220], [134], [314] peaks and [114], [008] peaks show opposite  trends with the addition of Ta. More information about the  XRD patterns can be seen in Supporting Information. Based  on the SAED images and Raman spectra, the enhanced antiferro electricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics can be explained,  being attributed to the reduced average polar iz ability of B-site  cations.  \n\nIn summary, a recoverable energy density of   $4.2~\\mathrm{J~cm^{-3}}$   with   $260\\%$   enhancement over the pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramic, and good  thermal stability of energy storage density with minimal variation   $(\\pm5\\%)$   over temperature range of   ${20}–{120}~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  have been  achieved in Ta-modified   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics. It is found that Ta  modification leads to decreased grain size and increased bulk  density, benefiting the dielectric breakdown strength. Further  investigations reveal that the incorporation of Ta to Nb site can  enhance the anti ferro electricity of   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics  owing to the reduced polar iz ability of B-site cations, which can  be confirmed by the polarization hysteresis, dielectric tunability,  selected-area electron diffraction and Raman measurements.  Both the enhanced dielectric breakdown strength and antiferro electricity contribute to the improved energy storage performance in Ta-modified  $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics, making   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{1-x}T a_{x})}$   $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   solid solution a promising lead-free candidate for dielectric  energy storage applications.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nFabrication of   $A g(N b_{\\mathit{1-x}}T a_{x})O_{3}$   Ceramics :   $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{1-x}\\mathsf{T a}_{x})\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   ceramics  (abbreviated as ANT x ,   $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}$  is 0, 5, 10, 15, and   $20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu}\\circ\\mathrm{\\textperthousand}$  , respectively)  were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction method using   $\\mathsf{A g}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$     $({\\geq}99.7\\%)$  ,  $\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{5}$     $(\\geq\\!99.99\\%)$  , and  $\\mathsf{T a}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{5}$     $(\\geq\\!99.99\\%)$   as the raw materials.  These oxide powders were mixed by using a planetary ball mill with  anhydrous ethanol at 250 rpm for   $24~\\mathsf{h}$  , in a nylon jar with zirconia ball  media. The dried powder mixture was pressed into disks with   $20~\\mathsf{m m}$    in diameter and   $2\\ m m$  in thickness and calcined at   $900~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $6~\\mathsf{h}$   in   $\\mathsf{O}_{2}$   atmosphere. The calcined powders were milled again and pressed  into disks of   $8\\ \\mathsf{r m m}$   in diameter and   $1.2~\\mathsf{m m}$   in thickness, followed by  cold isostatic pressing under 220 MPa for   $1.5~\\mathrm{min}$  . The compacted  powders were sintered at   $\\mathsf{T}\\,\\mathsf{T}00\\ \\mathrm{°C}$   for   $6~\\mathsf{h}$   in   ${\\sf O}_{2}$   atmosphere to prevent  the possible decomposition of the silver oxide at high temperature.  \n\nCharacterization of Phase, Micro structure, and Electrical Properties :  The density of the sintered pellets was determined by the Archimedes  method. XRD (D8 Advance A25, Bruker, Germany) with monochromatic   $\\textsf{C u}\\textsf{K a}$  radiation   $(\\lambda\\,=\\,\\mathsf{I}\\,.5405\\,\\mathrm{\\AA})$  ) was used to determine the phase  structure. The micro structure of the sintered samples was examined by  field emission scanning electron microscopy (Merlin VP compact Zeiss,  Germany). SAEDs and HREM investigations were performed using an  FEI TECNAI   $\\mathsf{G}^{2}20$   TEM with a double tilting stage, operating at   $200~\\mathrm{kV}.$  Samples for TEM experiments were prepared by mechanical polishing  followed by Ar-ion beam milling to reach electron transparency, which  was carried out using a Gatan PIPS 695 system, with Ar-ion beams  operating at   $0.1\\mathrm{-}4~\\mathrm{kV}.$   The pellets were polished down to a thickness of   $200~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   and coated with   $\\mathsf{A g}$   electrode at   $600~^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}/0.5~\\mathsf{h}$   for high electric  field measurements. The hysteresis loops were measured with a  ferroelectric measurement system at   $1\\ \\mathsf{H}\\mathsf{z}$   (aixACCT TF Analyzer 1000,  Germany). The values of breakdown strength can be evaluated by:  \n\n$$\nX_{i}\\!=\\!\\mathsf{I n}\\big(E_{i}\\big)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{Y_{i}=\\mathsf{I n}\\Big\\{\\mathsf{I n}\\big[\\mathsf{I}/\\big(\\mathsf{I}-P_{i}\\big)\\big]\\Big\\}}}\\\\ {~~}\\\\ {{P_{i}=i/\\big(\\mathsf{n}+\\mathsf{I}\\big)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  $n$   is the total number of samples,   $E_{i}$   is the breakdown electric field  for the  i th specimen arranging in ascending order, and   $\\mathsf{P}_{i}$  the probability  of dielectric breakdown.   $X_{i}$   and   $Y_{j}$   should have a linear relationship.  The capacitance-voltage was measured at   $\\rceil00\\ {\\mathsf{H z}}$   and direct current of   $300~\\lor$   over the temperature range   ${20}{-100}~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   using aixACC TF Analyzer  1000 (aixACCT TF Analyzer 1000, Germany). The Raman spectrum was  measured by the LabRAM HR800 (Horiba JobinYvon, Paris, France).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation  of China (Grant No. 51332002), the Ministry of Science and Technology  of China (Grant No. 2015 CB 654605), and the No. 60 Chinese Post-doc  Foundation (Grant No. 2016 M 600\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
