Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface.

OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

The  extra ethyl acetate was added into the toluene dispersion, the precipitate  was collected and re dispersed in   $n$  -octane or hexane. As for untreated  QDs, the reaction was magnetically stirred for 10 min after A-site cation  solution added, and the other processes were the same.  \n\nDevice  Fabrication :  Poly(ethylene  di oxy thi oph ene):polystyrene  sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) solutions (Baytron P VPAl 4083, filtered  through a   $0.22~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   filter) were spin-coated onto the indium tin oxide  (ITO)-coated glass substrates at 4000 rpm for  $60~\\mathrm{s}$   and baked at  $140~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$    for 15 min. The poly ( bis (4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl) amine) (PTAA)  (in chl oro benzene,  $5\\;\\mathsf{m g\\;m L^{-1}})$  ) and QDs (in  $n$  -octane,   $20\\;{\\sf m g\\;m L^{-1}}$  ) were  deposited layer by layer by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$  . The PTAA  and QD layers were baked at   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $15~\\mathsf{m i n}$   and   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10~\\mathsf{m i n}$  ,  respectively, before the deposition of the next layer. 1,3,5- Tris (1-phenyl-\n $\\daleth H$  -benz imi daz ol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi)   $(40\\ \\mathsf{n m})$   and LiF/Al electrodes \n\n  $(\\mathsf{I}\\ \\mathsf{n m}/\\mathsf{I}00\\ \\mathsf{n m})$   were deposited using a thermal evaporation system  through a shadow mask under a high vacuum of   $\\approx\\!2\\times\\mathsf{10^{-4}~P a}$  . The  device active area was   $4\\ m m^{2}$   as defined by the overlapping area of the  ITO and Al electrodes.  \n\nCharacterization and Device Measurements : One drop of the diluted  as-synthesized QD dispersion was placed onto a carbon-coated Cu grid,  and octane was allowed to evaporate at room temperature. TEM images  were taken on a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN TEM instrument operated at an  acceleration voltage of   $200~\\mathrm{kV}$   and equipped with a high-angle annular  dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM)  and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detector. XRD  samples were prepared by dropping the purified QD inks onto glass  substrates. XRD patterns were acquired using a Bruker D8 Advance  X-ray diffract o meter operating with   $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K o}$  radiation   $(\\lambda=1.5406\\ \\mathring{\\mathsf{A}})$  ). To  evaluate film roughness, QD inks were spin-coated onto Si substrates  and then analyzed by a Veeco D3100 AFM tool. The absorbance of QD  octane solution was measured by a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV–vis–NIR  spectrophotometer. The PL spectra of the QDs were obtained by using  a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer. XPS spectra were recorded on a  Thermo ESCALAB-250 spectrometer using a monochromatic Al KR  radiation source (1486.6 eV). XPS samples were prepared by dropping  the purified QD inks onto Si wafers. The absolute PLQY was measured  using a Horiba Fluorolog system equipped with a single grating and a  Quanta-Phil integration sphere coupled to the Fluorolog system. The  PL delay was measured on a time-correlated single-photo counting  (TCSPC) spec tro flu oro meter (FLS920, Edinburg Instrument, UK) at  room temperature. The ultrafast TA measurements were performed  on a femtosecond (fs) pump-probe system (Helios, Ultrafast System  LLC) under ambient conditions. The pump pulses (center wavelength:   $400\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m}$  ,   ${\\approx}20$   nJ pulse − 1  at the sample cell) were delivered by an  optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-800-fs) excited by a Ti:sapphire  regenerative amplifier (Legend Elite-1K-HE;   $800\\ \\mathrm{~\\textmu~}$  , 35 fs,   $3\\ \\mathrm{~\\textmu~}$    pulse − 1 ) seeded with a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser system (Micra-5)  and pumped with a neodymium-doped yttrium lithium fluoride  (Nd:YLF) laser (Evolution 30). The time delay between the pump and  probe pulses was varied by a motorized optical delay line (maximum \n\n  ${\\approx}8\\ \\mathsf{n s})$   $\\approx\\!100$   fs by a routine cross-correlation procedure. The EL spectra,   $L\\mathrm{-}J\\mathrm{-}V$    characteristics, and EQE were collected by using a Keithley 2400 source,  a fiber integration sphere, and a PMA-12 spectrometer for light output  measurements in glovebox filled with   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   and at room temperature (the  measurements equipment is designed by Hamamatsu Photonics Co.,  Ltd.).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was financially supported by the National Key Research and  Development Program of China (2016 Y FB 0401701), NSFC (61604074,  51572128, 61725402), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu  Province (BK20160827), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation  (2016 M 590455), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central  Universities (Grant Nos. 30917011202 and 30916015106), and PAPD of  Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\nelectrical  transportation,  organic–inorganic  hybrid  pass iv ation,  per ovsk ites,  quantum-dot-based  light-emitting  diodes,  radiative  recombination  \n\nReceived: August 19, 2018 Revised: September 15, 2018 Published online:  \n\n[1]\t A. Swarnkar, A.
