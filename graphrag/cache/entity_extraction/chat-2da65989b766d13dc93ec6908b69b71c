Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The  LOM on the binary surface generates a theoretical over potential  of 1.15 V with the desorption of  $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   as RDS. In contrast, the surface of the HEOs possesses a low over potential of   $0.58~\\mathrm{V}$  with  a much small barrier of   $0.39~\\mathrm{V}$   for   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   desorption. Therefore, it  can be concluded that the OER prefers to proceed via the LOM  on the higher entropy surface with lower over potential, which  is consistent with experimental data.  \n\nGenerally, the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface  of the electro catalyst plays a vital role in the OER mechanism,  since it is strongly correlated to the generation of oxygen intermediate of   ${\\bf O}{\\bf O}^{\\ast}{\\bf-}\\left(V_{\\mathrm{o}}\\right)$  .

As shown in Figure 4e,f, the  formation of vacant oxygen sites in the plane site   $(\\mathrm{x}^{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{y}^{2})$   of   $\\mathrm{COO}_{6}$  octahedral (  $\\cdot1^{\\mathrm{st}}$   layer) in HEOs surface   $(-0.53\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   is more thermo dynamically favorable than the binary surface   $(-0.23\\,\\mathrm{\\eV})$  ,  indicating that the ease of   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$   generation in HEOs. Further, the  stability of these as-formed oxygen vacancies was also quantified by calculating the formation of   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$   in the corner site   $(Z^{2})$   of   $\\mathrm{COO}_{6}$   octahedral (  $\\cdot2^{\\mathrm{nd}}$   layer). As can be seen in Figure 4f, the formation of   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$   in the 2nd layer is difficult, with an energy barrier  of   $0.39\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   suggesting that the replenishment of   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$   in the 1st  layer by the oxygen ion in the 2nd layer is thermodynamic ally  unfavorable. In comparison, such   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$   diffusion energy is only   $-1.17\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for binary material, manifesting the instability of   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$   in  the top layer. Therefore, it can be concluded that the formation  of highly stable   $V_{\\mathrm{o}}$   on the HEOs surface is preferable, which  further benefits the OER via LOM.  \n\nOn the other hand, the optical bandgap measurement  (HEOs:   $2.39\\,\\mathrm{~eV~}$   vs Binary: 2.77  eV) (Figure S14, Supporting  Information) confirms the enhanced conductivity of materials  with the increase of configuration entropy. This enhancement  could be partially explained by the incorporation of oxygen  vacancies/formation of high valence cation which was reported  to create a new state near the Fermi level, narrow the band gap,  and facilitates the electrical conductivity.  \n\n# 2.5. Identification of Key Intermediate via LOM  \n\nBesides theoretical evidence, the OER proceeding on oxides  via the participation of lattice oxygen typically exhibits pHdependent activity at the RHE scale experimentally. The difference between the electron transfer and proton transfer kinetics  contributes to the phenomenon of pH-dependent activity.  As  illustrated in  Figure   5 a,b and Figure S15, Supporting Information, as the structure entropy increases, the HEOs show the  strongest pH dependence of a slope of 1.08 on the RHE scale,  while the binary sample has a much smaller slope of 0.41. Such  a difference indicates that the non-concerted proton-electron  transfer process for the OER can be significantly reinforced  when raising the configuration entropy.  \n\nOn the other hand, the OER via LOM involves the formation  of negatively charged   $\\mathsf{O}_{2}^{2-}$    intermediate which can be directly  tracked by Tetra methyl ammonium cation   $\\mathrm{(TMA^{+})}$  .  The  $\\mathrm{TMA^{+}}$    demonstrates specific interaction with these negative oxygenated species formed during the OER via LOM and strongly  binds to the surface of the catalyst. As shown in Figure S16,  Supporting Information, two broad Raman peaks at 558  and   $680\\ \\mathrm{\\bar{cm}}^{-1}$  are assigned to   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$   bending vibration and  stretching vibration for cobalt perovskite, respectively.  After  anodic polarization at   $1.6~\\mathrm{V}$   versus RHE in   $1\\textbf{M}$   MTAOH electrolyte, the peak at   $558~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   is significantly weakened. Instead,  a broad peak at   $492~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   emerged, which can be assigned to  the in situ formation of   $\\mathrm{CoOOH}$   due to surface reconstruction.  Besides, the shoulder peaks appearing at  $458\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   agree  with the Raman characteristic peaks of   $\\mathrm{{TMA^{+}}}$  , which underlines that   $\\mathrm{{TMA^{+}}}$  strongly binds to the HEOs surface bridged  by the in situ formed   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}$    intermediate during the OER process. Another peak corresponding to   $\\mathrm{{TMA^{+}}}$   at   ${\\approx}755\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   is not  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/111f6e8907da5989814da7c7d61edb6355597b1c38f1774bfe760b04fba826ba-1727104619.jpg)  \nFigure   5.   a) pH dependence of the OER activities of HEOs. b) Current densities of various catalysts at  $1.55\\,\\lor$  versus RHE as a function of the pH value.

Moreover, the surface a morph iz ation of the HEOs was also  confirmed by the TEM analysis (Figure S17, Supporting Information), in which an amorphous region of  ${\\approx}3\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   was found  on the CV-cycled HEOs electrode. Furthermore, we compared  the OER activities of different electro catalysts in   $1\\ \\mathrm{M\\KOH}$   and  TMAOH solutions. As shown in Figure  5c,d and Figure S18,  Supporting Information, the configuration entropy is proportional to the decays of the Tafel slope and polarization potential,  and the HEOs exhibit a significantly increase of OER polarization voltage by   $93\\ \\mathrm{mV}$   at   $10\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , and its Tafel slope is  increased by   $86~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1}$   (inset in Figure 5d and Figure S19,  Supporting Information), mainly because of the inhibition of  the LOM with strong binding of  $\\mathrm{{TMA^{+}}}$  .  \n\n# 3.
