CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

We first validate that the liftoff process does not alter the structure, morphology, and optical  features of poly crystalline perovskite films (see Figure S2 and  Note S1, Supporting Information, for details), enabling indepth characterizations of the previously inaccessible buried  interfaces and the potential impacts of the pass iv ation. Firstly,  cross-sectional techniques enable direct observations of the  micro structures of the perovskite films in inverted PSCs. From  the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the control  device (Figure  1b), the perovskite grains closely pack normal  to the interface. Bright grains are distributed throughout the  perovskite thin film, while some small grains are located near  the top interface and other flaky grains are located at the grain  boundaries near the buried interface. Transmission electron  microscopy (TEM) is used to determine their compositions and  crystal structures (Figure 1c and Figure S3, Supporting Information). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission  electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding  energy disperse X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings confirm that  the brighter strip-like structures are the large bright flaky grains  observed by SEM, which predominately consist of lead (Pb),  iodine (I), and bromide (Br), with the larger average atomic  number evident from back scattered electrons (even when the  detector is pulled away from the standard detector position in  the second electron imaging mode). The large strip-like grains  show highly oriented lattice lines (in the selected area denoted  as “1”) corresponding to the crystal planes of the hexagonal lead  mixed-halide crystals, determined by indexing the diffraction  spots in the selected area (denoted as   $^{\\alpha}2^{\\flat}$  ), with a lattice spacing  of   $6.66\\textup{\\AA}$  , closely matching the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   (005) crystal plane   $(\\bar{6}.98\\ \\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}_{:}$  ,  PDF No. 73–1286). Such electron diffraction patterns are different from those of the perovskite crystals near the strip-like  grains (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). From the X-ray  diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite film (Figure S2b,  Supporting Information), we note that the diffraction peak at   ${\\approx}13.1^{\\circ}$   is larger than that of the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$     $(\\approx\\!12.7^{\\circ})$  , in agreement  with a smaller lattice spacing for the strip-like grains obtained  by TEM. When I ions (radius 1.70 Å) are substituted by Br  ions (radius   $1.06\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  ), the lattice spacing of the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystal will  decrease due to the smaller radius of Br ions, since the striplike grains have a composition of   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2-x}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}$  . Through further  analysis of the crystalline features near the strip-like grains, we  note that there are randomly distributed smaller lead-halide  grains near the strip-like   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2-x}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x},$   forming the sub-microscale  complex phases comprising multiple nanoscale lead halides and adjacent per ovsk ites surrounding those lead halides  (Figure S3c, Supporting Information).  \n\nTo compare the differences between the top and bottom  sides of the poly crystalline film, we used the lift-off technique  to expose the buried interface of the perovskite film. From the  SEM images for both sides of the perovskite film, the larger  perovskite grain sizes   $(\\approx\\!233\\pm8\\;\\mathrm{nm})$  ) are observed on the bottom  side, in comparison to those on the top side   $(\\approx\\!186\\,\\pm\\,6\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ,  Figure   2 a,b and Figure   $\\mathrm{S4a}$  , Supporting Information). Moreover,  the bottom side presents large flaky lead-halide grains aligned  almost normal to the substrate, consistent with the crosssectional SEM and TEM results. By contrast, the top side is  more uniform, with smaller lead-halide grains filling in the  perovskite grain boundaries. We also note that the accumulation of large flaky lead halides at the bottom side is commonly  observed in a variety of per ovsk ites processed from the   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}.$  - excess precursor, regardless of the bottom contacts on which  the per ovsk ites are crystallized (Figure S4c,d, Supporting Information). For the stoic hio metric perovskite film (made from the  precursor without excess   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\rangle$  ), the bottom side is less compact  in comparison to those processed from the precursor with  excess   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   (Figure S4b, Supporting Information), which is  likely due to different film growth processes.  \n\nTo characterize the chemical composition distribution of both sides, we performed nanoscale-resolved Fourier transform infrared (nano-FTIR) microscopy and X-ray  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/04ac33ecbc7daef29aeb62b914b9be61c72dbc4a2ff34d16b44d0b9e8ddbe9ef-1727130669.jpg)  \nFigure   1.   a) Schematic of the lift-off process.

The non-destructive chemical mapping afforded by nano-FTIR allows us to resolve the  spatial distribution of the organic components near the surfaces of the film   $(\\approx\\!10\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  . From the nano-FTIR white-light  imaging (Figure  2c,d and Figure S5a, Supporting Information), we observe more pronounced in homogeneity for the  lateral concentration of the dominant A-site cation   $\\mathrm{(FA^{+}}$  ;  the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   is below the detection level) at the bottom side in  comparison to the top side (Figure  2e). This could arise  from the local accumulation of organic components or the  existence of flaky lead halides at the bottom side during  annealing/cooling.  XPS characterization shows that the  average   $\\mathrm{([I]\\,+\\,[B r])/[P b]}$   ratios are 2.81 and 2.32 for the top  side and bottom side, respectively, with respect to the nominal value of 2.95 (Figure S5b, Supporting Information),  further emphasizing the uneven chemical distributions on  both sides. Moreover, we also observe that the signals from  metallic Pb   $(\\mathrm{Pb}^{0})$   are absent in the XPS spectra (Pb 4f) of the  bottom side but are evident on the surface (top side) of the  perovskite film as reported elsewhere,  although the origin  of the   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   remains elusive.  \n\nTo probe the local energetic variation, Kelvin probe force  microscopy (KPFM) was used to correlate the surface potential with topography. We note that the flaky lead halides at  the bottom side have larger surface potentials   $(\\approx\\!50\\ \\mathrm{\\mV})$  with respect to the rest of the film, significantly changing  the local distribution of the bottom energy levels (Figure 2f).  While on the top side, the surface potentials are more homogeneous (Figure S5c, Supporting Information) than those  of the bottom.
