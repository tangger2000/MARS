Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

All substrates were further cleaned by UV-ozone for 15 min before  deposition of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ESL. A   $20{\\sim}40{\\cdot}\\mathsf{n m\\ S n O_{2}}$   QD ESL was deposited on  the cleaned FTO substrate by spin-coating as-prepared colloidal   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  QD solution with different molar concentrations (0.10, 0.15, and   $0.20~\\mathrm{{M}^{\\prime}}$  )  at 500 rpm for   $3\\:\\:s,\\:\\:3000$   rpm for   $30\\,\\mathrm{~s~}$  . Following, the as-deposited   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   QD ESL was annealed on a hot plate at 50, 100, 150, or   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  ,  respectively, for  $\\texttt{l h}$   in air. Before depositing perovskite layer, the   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  QD ESL coated-FTO substrate was treated by UV-ozone for   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  ,  and then transferred to the Argon-filled glovebox. The mixed-cation  perovskite was deposited via a one-step spin-coating procedure, and  annealed at   $100\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $30\\:\\mathrm{\\mum}$  .  For depositing   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   film, the   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   perovskite solution was spin-coated on   $\\mathsf{F T O}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   substrate at  500 rpm for  $3\\ s$   and 4000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  , note that   $300~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$  chl oro benzene  was added dropped onto the spinning perovskite film 20 s before  the end of this program.

Finally, a thickness of   $80~\\mathsf{n m}$   Au was deposited by  thermal evaporation.  \n\nCharacterization : The crystal structure and phase of the materials  were characterized using an XRD (Bruker AXS, D8 Advance) with   $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K o}$  radiation under operation conditions of   $40\\;\\mathrm{~\\textperthousand~}$  and   $40\\ \\mathrm{\\mA}$  . The  morph o logie s and micro structures were investigated by a field emission  scanning electron microscopy (JSM 6700F) and a TEM (JEOL-2010). The  absorption and transmission spectra of the perovskite films and ESLs  deposited on FTO were measured by an UV–vis spectrophotometer  (CARY5000, Varian, Australia) in a wavelength range at   $300–800\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   at  room temperature. XPS was performed using an XPS system (Thermo   $(J-V)$   characteristics of  the devices were measured by using a   $\\mathsf{B I S O A}$   semiconductor parameter  analyzer under the calibrated AAA class ORIEL Sol3A solar simulator  equipped with an AM 1.5 filter at   $100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\ c m^{-2}$  . The   $J^{-V}$  curves were  obtained from both reverse (from 1.2 to   $-0.2\\;\\forall)$  ) and forward scan (from   $-0.2$   to   $1.2~\\lor)$  ) directions at   $0.1~\\vee~{\\mathsf{S}}^{-1}$   with a delay time ranging from  20 to   $500~\\mathsf{m s}$  . The area of the Au electrode was 0.09 or   $1.0\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{2}$  , which  defines the active area. The EQE measurements of photovoltaic device  were carried out using a QE-R 3011 system (Enli Tech, Taiwan). The light  soaking stability test was performed under   $100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\ c m^{-2}$   illumination  by a solar simulator, the light intensity was calibrated by means of Si  photodiode with a KG5 filter. Device stability under UV illumination  is carried out using a   $325\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   ultraviolet light. All the electrochemical  measurements were carried out with an electrochemical workstation  (CHI660E, Chenhua, Shanghai). Hall measurements were carried out  with a Lake Shore 7500/9500 Series Hall Effect/Electronic Transport  Measurement System in a four-point configuration measuring an area of   $\\mathsf{I}\\ c\\mathsf{m}^{2}$  .
