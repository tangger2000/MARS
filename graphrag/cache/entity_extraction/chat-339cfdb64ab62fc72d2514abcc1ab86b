CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Following this work, Chiang et  al. fabricated a high quality thick   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   film with large grain  sizes through the use of   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   additives and N,N-dimethyl form amide (DMF) vapor treatment during the two-step spin coating  process. Based on this modified two-step process, a high PCE  of   $20.1\\%$   was obtained.  As can be seen, the fullerene and its  derivatives are also efficient ETM for PSCs, the performance of  PSCs based on fullerene derivatives is comparable to that of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  based PSCs. Furthermore, high quality fullerene and its derivatives can be fabricated by low temperature solution process,  which is favorable to reduce the cost. However, electron mobility  in C60 film is about   $1\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   and that of PCBM is   $2.6\\times$   $10^{-4}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , both of which are lower than that of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  . On the other hand, the position of valence band of fullerene and  its derivatives   $(-6.3\\,\\mathrm{~eV}$   for C60,   $-6.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for PCBM, compared  with vacuum energy level) is higher than that of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$     $(-8.0\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  compared with vacuum energy level), which leads to a weaker  hole blocking ability.  Additionally, according to the research  of Bao et al., the fullerene part of PCBM molecules interacts with  oxygen and water, which results in device degradation.  \n\n$\\mathrm{ZnO}$   is another widely used ETM, which has attracted much  attention as an alternative to  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   in DSSCs and poly­ mer solar  cells. Recently,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   based PSCs have also been researched  systematically. Although the best PCE of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   based PSCs  is about   $17\\%$  , which is inferior to that of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   based PSCs,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   is still an efficient and promising alternative to   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  in PSCs.  First of all, ZnO has very high transmittance in  the visible spectra and more importantly, is low in cost. As  shown in  Figure   2 a,b, ZnO has similar energy band position  and physical properties to   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   but much higher electron  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/7b67c9b66131f52baeb8891f2eec63e86beedf6f786fd44eb8a08997271d82ff-1727115233.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   a) Comparison of the electrical properties of ZnO and   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  .  b) The energy level of   $Z\\mathsf{n O}$  ,   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  , and other usually used materials in  PSCs.  c) Three different crystal structures of  $Z\\mathsf{n O}$  .

Second,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   is easy to crystallize and dope. At the  same time, the layered structure of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   crystal structure, like  shown in Figure 2c, leads to a different growth rates along  different directions, as a result, various ZnO nano structures,  such like nanowires,  nanotubes,  nanobelts,   nanorings,  nano flowers,  nanorods, and so on,   can be fabricated easily. Last but not least, high temperature annealing is not necessary for most ZnO fabrication  methods, which means that it can be produced with a lower  cost and thermal budget and thus be potentially used in flexible devices. These properties make   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   a promising ETM for  PSCs. Meanwhile, although most physical properties of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$    and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   are similar, there are also some distinct properties  for each material. As a result, studies on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   based solar cells  enrich the family of PSCs, which will in turn help to improve  the performance of PSCs.  \n\nIn this article, we briefly summarized the common fabrication methods of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   materials and systematically reviewed the  application of various types of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs in PSCs. The review  shows the origin of different performances between  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM  based PSCs and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   based PSCs. The important role of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$    ETM preparation and optimization in solar cell performance  is introduced. In addition, limitations of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs are also  discussed. This review tends to present a timely update on the  recent development of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based PSCs and provides  some guidelines for further optimization and design of PSCs  based on  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs and beyond.  \n\n# 2. Planar PSCs with a Compact ZnO Film   as the ETM  \n\nAs well known, perovskite materials have a long carrier diffusion length and ambipolar behavior. In other words, perovskite  materials can efficiently transport both electrons and holes.  This indicates that planar structure PSC is feasible. A simpler  solar cell structure without the mesoporous layer opens opportunities for potential applications of PSCs in tandem solar cell  and flexible devices. Thanks to the high mobility of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , to  date, planar PSCs with a compact   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film as the ETM have  been widely studied.  \n\nTo achieve high performance PSCs, a uniform and thin   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  film with low density of defects and pinholes is essential. The  usually used  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   compact films are prepared by radio frequency  (RF) sputtering. RF sputtering method is a vacuum coating technology and its working processes are shown in Figure 2d. A gas,  usually argon, is purged into a vacuum chamber. Under a high  frequency and high voltage electric field, it forms high energy  ion flow. The ionized gas particles bombard a target and materials sputtered off the target deposited on a substrate and form  a film made of the target material. The important parameters  influence the product properties include composition and purity  of target, work gas pressure, ratio of different work gases, RF  power and so on. By optimizing these parameters, a high quality   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film with high transmittance and good electronic properties can be obtained.  Because of the high energy coating  process and vacuum coating process, the adhesion between the  film and substrate is steady and the quality of the product film  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/56f5e971f1b3d7a419470593380a93977fbddc731d3912bc208f94d76766575f-1727115111.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $Z\\mathsf{n O}.10\\%$   film, and e,f) ZnO $20\\%$   film. g) Low magnification cross-section view of a perovskite film deposited on the  $Z\\mathsf{n O}{\\cdot}20\\%$   film. h) The  $J^{-V}$   curves of PSCs based on ZnO-Ar,   $Z\\mathsf{n O}.10\\%$  , and  $Z\\mathsf{n O}{\\cdot}20\\%$   films. i) Dark current voltage characteristics of solar cells based on ZnO-Ar,  $Z\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
