CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

This is considered as the main reason of  the considerably lower efficiency of 2D  per ovsk ites as compared with their 3D  counterparts.  \n\n2D per ovsk ites have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic  materials owing to their excellent stability compared with their 3D counterparts. However, in typical 2D per ovsk ites, the highly conductive inorganic  layers are isolated by large organic cations leading to quantum confinement  and thus inferior electrical conductivity across layers. To address this issue,  the large organic cations are replaced with small propane-1,3-diammonium  (PDA) cations to reduce distance between the inorganic perovskite layers. As  shown by optical characterizations, quantum confinement is no longer dominating in the PDA-based 2D per ovsk ites. This leads to considerable enhancement of charge transport as confirmed with electrochemical impedance  spectroscopy, time-resolved photo luminescence, and mobility measurements.  The improved electric properties of the interlayer-engineered 2D per ovsk ites  yield a power conversion efficiency of   $\\mathbf{13.0\\%}$  . Furthermore, environmental  st abilities of the PDA-based 2D per ovsk ites are improved. PDA-based 2D  perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with encapsulation can retain over   $\\mathbf{\\mathfrak{g o}}\\%$   of their  efficiency upon storage for over   $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{1000}}}\\,\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{h}}}$  , and PSCs without encapsulation can  maintain their initial efficiency at  $\\mathbf{70}\\,^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C}$   for over  $\\mathbf{\\rceil}00~\\mathsf{h}$  , which exhibit promising st abilities. These results reveal excellent op to electronic properties and  intrinsic st abilities of the layered per ovsk ites with reduced interlayer distance.  \n\nRecently, tremendous efforts have been  dedicated to   $n$  -but yl ammonium (BA)- based 2D per ovsk ites. It was reported that  by controlling crystal orientation in these  BA-based 2D perovskite films with hot  casting method, an efficient charge transport along out-of-plane direction can be  achieved, which can mitigate the influence  of the poor charge transport between inorganic layers, leading to improved photovoltaic efficiency of   $13.7\\%$  .  However, this  effect of preferred orientation is so far only  observed in BA-based 2D per ovsk ites. Efficiencies of 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  without such a preferred orientation are  still below   $10\\%$  .  Thus, it is highly desirable to develop alternative approaches for  enhancing charge transport between inorganic layers in 2D perovskite.  \n\nHere, we report a new approach to  address this issue by reducing distance  between the inorganic layers. A reduced interlayer distance  around   $2\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   is observed in Propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA)- based 2D per ovsk ites, which is shorter than the BA-based  2D per ovsk ites with a distance about   $7\\textup{\\AA}$  . More importantly,  optical characterizations show that quantum confinement is  not dominating in the PDA-based 2D per ovsk ites. Without such  quantum confinement as in the case of BA-based 2D perovskites, carrier transport across neighboring inorganic perovskite  layers is much enhanced. Furthermore, st abilities of the PDAbased 2D per ovsk ites are also improved due to the enhanced  interaction across the perovskite structure. As a result, the  corresponding solar cells achieve a high efficiency of   $13.0\\%$    with enhanced st abilities. Our results reveal the excellent performances of the 2D perovskite with short interlayer distance,  which provide an alternative approach for improving the efficiency and stability of 2D per ovsk ites.  \n\n2D per ovsk ites  $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}{}_{2}\\mathrm{MA}_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}\\mathrm{I}_{3n+1}$  , where   $\\mathrm{{A^{\\prime}}}$   is large alkylammonium cation, are a class of quantum-well-like materials configured in a manner that   $\\mathrm{{A^{\\prime}}}$   layers terminate 3D cubic perovskite  structure along specific direction. Value of   $n$   determines thickness of inorganic layer and, as a result, the degree of quantum  confinement as well as the optical bandgap.  2D per ovsk ites  have emerged as promising materials in the field of photo­ voltaics because of their tunability of op to electronic properties  and more importantly environmental st abilities.  However, the  large organic cations, which act like insulating spacing layers  between conductive inorganic slabs, inhibit charge transport  \n\n2D PDAMA  $\\mathsf{\\Delta}_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}\\mathrm{I}_{3n+1}$   (  $.n=2$  , 3, and 4) and   $\\mathrm{BA}_{2}\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Pb}_{4}\\mathrm{I}_{13}$    perovskite thin films are fabricated by a one-step spin-coating  method. The corresponding scanning electron microscope  (SEM) images are provided in Figure S1 in the Supporting  Information. Crystal structures are confirmed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis ( Figure   1 a). The reflections at low diffraction angles (i.e., (0k0) reflections) have been reported as  an important feature of 2D per ovsk ites.  For all PDA-based  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/017da14540324d124ea2297b86c6d03fff9b72cce2e113bfc83d7281f78c20de-1727117870.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  $\\mathsf{P D A M A}_{n-1}\\mathsf{P b}_{n}\\mathsf{I}_{3n+1}$   perovskite thin films with   $n=2$   to 4 and   $\\mathsf{B A}_{2}\\mathsf{M A}_{3}\\mathsf{P b}_{4}|_{13}$   perovskite thin films. (0k0) peaks are marked by star  symbols. b) Illustration of their respective diffraction planes.  \n\nperovskite samples in Figure 1a (0k0), reflection peaks at  low degree region (marked by star symbols in Figure 1a) are  clearly observed. Many studies demonstrated that the large  cations (i.e., PDA in this work) terminate the formation of  3D cubic perovskite structure along specific direction, which  leads to elongated unit cell and can be characterized by (0k0)  reflections at low diffraction angles.  (040) peaks show different peak positions when  n  is increased from 2 to 3, and  this is highly related to the thickness of the inorganic layers.  Based on these (0k0) reflection peaks, thicknesses of the 2D  perovskite layers are calculated to be 14.3, 20.4, and   $26.7\\textup{\\AA}$  for   $n\\ =\\ 2$  , 3, and 4, respectively. From these thicknesses  and the size of the inorganic octahedron (6.2  Å), distance  between the neighboring inorganic layers can be determined  to be   ${\\approx}2$    Å (e.g.,   $14.3\\,-\\,2\\,\\times\\,6.2$  , etc.). Respective diffraction  planes of   $\\mathrm{\\mathrm{PDAMA}}_{n-1}\\mathrm{Pb}_{n}\\mathrm{I}_{3n+1}$   are shown in Figure 1b, which  contain 3D perovskite-like layers alternating with single PDA  organic cation layers. The small size of PDA results in a short  distance of   $\\approx\\!2\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   between the apical iodine atoms and neighboring layers.  \n\nFor BA-based 2D perovskite in Figure 1, peaks of (0k0) reflections at low diffraction angle can hardly be measured which  is due to the preferred orientation with a high proportion of  grains with their conductive layer parallel to the current conduction direction (i.e., strong (\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
