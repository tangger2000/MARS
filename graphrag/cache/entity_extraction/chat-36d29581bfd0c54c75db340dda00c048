CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

These results  reveal that the charge recombination is effectively reduced by  reduced trap density,  another reason for higher performance  of the MAPbI 3 –DS device.  \n\nUp to now, all high efficiency F-PSCs reported in literature are based on very small area   $(<\\!0.1\\:\\mathrm{~cm}^{2})$   devices, it is still challenging to manufacture the large area F-PSCs  with high PCE. Therefore, we fabricated F-PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$   absorbers with larger area.  Figure   5 a shows the   $J{-}V$  curves of the F-PSCs based on different areas, with key  parameters summarized in Table 1, and device photographs  are shown in the insets. The flexible device with an area of   $0.2\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   offers PCE of   $16.65\\%$   with  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $22.29\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  of   $1.088\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , and FF of 0.688. When the device is expanded to   $1.2\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{2}$  , PCE drops to   $13.35\\%$  . Even though these efficiencies are the highest reported to date for their respective large  area of F-PSCs, detailed analysis is needed to improve the  efficiency in large area cells. It is clear that when the area is  expanded to   $1.2~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   remains the same at   $1.008\\,\\mathrm{~V},$   the  PCE loss is from the significant losses in   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF. These  losses are apparently caused by the series resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{s}})$  that is increased by a factor of 2 (Table 1). When PET/ITO is  improved with higher conductivity,   $R_{s}$   will be decreased and  both   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF will benefit. It is expected that optimized  device design and improved PET/ITO will lead to higher large  area PCE. Figure 5b shows the incident photon-to-charge  conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the integrated current  of the IPCE curves with the AM 1.5G photon flux for the  flexible devices with different active areas. The calculated   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  values by integrating the IPCE curves are 22.35, 21.63, and \n\n  $20.27\\:\\mathrm{\\mA}\\:\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$   corresponding to areas of 0.052, 0.2, and \n\n  $1.2\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  , respectively, very close to the  $J{-}V$  measurements. The  high PCE of large area F-PSCs indicates that the MAPbI 3 –DS  films are very uniform in large area. With proper design in  large area devices to ensure controlled   $R_{s}$  , it is expected that  the PCE of large area devices would be further enhanced.  \n\nIn conclusion, the effective DS additive has been successfully developed to improve the PCE of F-PSCs. The efficiency  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/6b4866df2e0b254b5293f82eb661523f78bea4d75f5421810e1a3818924efe83-1727118117.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $J^{-V}$   curves and b) IPCE of different active areas for the   $\\mathsf{M A P b l}_{3}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{D S}$   flexible devices, and the inset shows the picture of F-PSCs  with various active areas.  \n\nof the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   flexible device with small area is enhanced to as  high as   $18.40\\%$  , and the large area F-PSC achieves to   $13.35\\%$  ,  both efficiencies are the highest reported to date for F-PSCs.  Careful  $J{-}V$  analysis shows that the large area cell gives identical   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   as the small area cells, with proper design of large area  device to ensure controlled   $R_{s}$  , it is expected that the PCE of  large area cell may be significantly increased. In addition, the  environmental stability of the F-PSCs is significantly improved  when the DS additive is used. The excellent performance of  the   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}–\\mathrm{DS}}$   flexible devices is attributed to large grain  size and good crystal lin it y of the resultant perovskite absorber  layer, thanks to the decreased Gibbs free energy and slowed  down growth rate for perovskite crystallization process when   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   forms chelated intermediate with DS. It is expected that  the present strategy will help guide development of large-scale  F-PSCs for practical applications.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : MAI was synthesized and purified according to the  previous reported procedure.

All the solvents were purchased from Aldrich without purification.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The   ${\\approx}90\\ \\mathsf{n m\\ M g F_{2}}$   was deposited on the back  of PET by electron beam evaporation as an anti reflection coating,  and the different thicknesses of ITO were deposited on the front  of PET substrates by magnetron sputtering at low temperature.  The sheet resistance was probed by a SB118 four-probe meter. The   $60\\ n m\\ N b_{2}O_{5}$   was deposited on PET/ITO and glass/ITO substrates  by electron beam evaporation as the ESLs. The perovskite precursor  solution, with   $190.8~\\mathrm{mg}$   MAI and   $554.4\\ \\mathsf{m g}\\ \\mathsf{P b I}_{2}$  , was stirred at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $^{\\mathrm{~2~h~}}$  , and then filtered using   $0.22~\\upmu\\mathsf{m}$   Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene  (PTFE) filter elements. The different volume ratios of DS were added  in the filtered solution, and then stirred at room temperature for  $2~\\mathsf{h}$  .  The solution was then spin-coated onto  $2.5\\ \\mathsf{c m}\\times2.5\\ \\mathsf{c m}\\ \\mathsf{P E T/I T O/}$   $\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{5}$   and glass/ITO/  $\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{5}$   substrates using anti solvent method.
