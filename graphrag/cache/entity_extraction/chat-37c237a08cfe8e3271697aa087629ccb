CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface.

OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The EIS data can be well fitted by the insert equivalent circuit in Figure   $5\\mathrm{g}$  and the EIS fitting parameters are  summarized in Table  S5 (Supporting Information), where   $R_{s}$    represents the series resistance including the contact resistance and sheet resistance and   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   is the recombination resistance. In the Nyquist plot (Figure 5g), the high-frequency semicircle originated from the charge recombination, and the lowfrequency semicircle is connected with the dielectric relaxation.  As displayed in Table S5 (Supporting Information), the devices  without CBL, with p  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL, and with TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL  possess   $R_{s}$   of 47 .34, 32.65 and   $32.04\\ \\Omega$  , respectively, and show   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   of 5812, 7694, and   $9621~\\Omega$  , respectively. Among them, the  TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device shows the smallest   $R_{s}$   and largest   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}},$   indicating more efficient charge transport and less charge  recombination. The TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL with higher electrical  conductivity and matching energy level offers the more efficient  charge transport and less charge recombination, and therefore  the TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device shows the increased  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$    and the obviously improved FF, achieving the excellent PCE.  \n\nCharge recombination mechanisms of the PVSCs with/ without   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}.$  -based CBL are further analyzed by measuring  the dependence of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   on light intensity   $\\left(P_{\\mathrm{light}}\\right)$  . Figure 5h displays the fitting curves of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and   $P_{\\mathrm{light}}$   according to the Equation of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\,\\propto\\,n k T/q\\,\\ln P_{\\mathrm{light}},$   where   $n$   is the ideal factor,   $k$   is the  Boltzmann constant,   $T$  is the Kelvin temperature, and   $q$   is  the elementary charge.  When the   $n$   value is close to 2, the  trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall recombination is dominant  in the devices.
