CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It can clearly  be seen in these figure (see Figures S1–S3, Supporting Information for magnified images) that unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals are formed  on S-3 films. From the XRD patterns, an additional peak at   $12.5^{\\circ}$  was observed in S-3 films, which was assigned to the   $(0\\;0\\;l)$   plane  of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals.  All the other peaks originated from the  cubic perovskite structure (Figure 1d–f) .  This may suggest that  the white particles in Figure 1c are  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals.  \n\nNext, we fabricated an initial batch of planar PSCs with S-1,  S-2, or S-3 films to investigate their performance. The schematic  PSC structure is shown in Figure 1g. Detailed device fabrication methods are summarized in the experimental section. Cur- rent density–voltage   $(J-V)$   characteristics of PSCs with S-1, S-2,  or S-3 films are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information),  and solar cell parameters estimated from this figure are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). In this batch,  the S-2 devices had the highest PCE with the maximum value  of   $19.01\\%$  . However, the differences in PCE among the S-1, S-2,  or S-3 devices were smaller than the deviation, which means  that the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   concentrations in the precursor solutions had  little influence on the initial PCEs. PSCs’ statistics is shown  in Figure 1h, with the average PCEs being   $17.3\\%$  ,   $17.6\\%$  , and   $16.9\\%$   for S-1, S-2, and S-3 devices, respectively. After the initial  screening, we chose to make an additional batch using the S-2  solution because this S-2 solution provided the slightly higher  average efficiency. The   $J{-}V$   curves from the second batch of  S-2 PSCs are shown in Figure 1i. The second batch was fabri­ cated after additional optimization (see the Experimental  Section for the optimization details). The champion S-2 device  showed a PCE of   $21.4\\%$  , a short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$   of  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/f4fb039d2ac1ca1c7c190fe23ae3dfac86e656b09f542bb2a2b49f2b763d266a-1727127201.jpg)  \nFigure   2.   Unreacted  $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   crystals in perovskite films had a negative impact on the long-term stability of PSCs.

To prepare the samples for the SEM characterization,  the Au electrode and spiro-OMeTAD layers were removed as follows: 1) Scotch tape was attached on top of the  $\\mathsf{A u}$   electrode; 2) the Au electrode was  removed by peeling off scotch tape; 3)  $\\mathsf{I}~\\mathsf{m L}$   of chl oro benzene (CB) was dropped on the substrate, followed by the substrate rotation at 2000 rpm for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$  . During the substrate rotation,   $3~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of CB was continuously dropped onto the substrate to remove the spiro-OMeTAD layer completely.  \n\n$23.24\\mathrm{~mA~cm}^{-2}$  , an open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$   of   $1.18\\mathrm{~V},$   and a  fill factor (FF) of 0.78 when measured in the reverse scan. In  case of the forward scan, the PCE,  $J_{S C}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  , and FF values were   $21.1\\%$  ,   $23.27\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , 1.17 V, and 0.77, respectively. The inset  of Figure 1i shows the statistics of these devices fabricated in  the same batch. All of the devices had PCEs above   $18.9\\%$   with  the average value   ${>}20\\%$  . The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the champion S-2 device is shown in Figure S5  (Supporting Information).  \n\nFigure    2 a shows the PCE evolution of PSCs, which were  fabricated in the first batch with the different concentrations  of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and operated under continuous illumination with a  light intensity of   $100\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}}$   (1 sun). The S-1 and S-2 PSCs  retained   $92\\%$   and   $99\\%$   of their initial PCEs after   $520\\textrm{h}$   of continuous illumination, respectively. On the contrary, the PCE of  the S-3 PSCs decreased to   $47\\%$   of its initial value. We believe  that this quick degradation of the S-3 PSCs was caused by the  presence of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   crystals in the perovskite films. Detailed evolutions of   $J_{S C}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  , and FF are shown in Figure S6 (Supporting  Information).  \n\nTo further investigate the degradation associated with  unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , we performed morphological character iz ations on S-3 films and devices as shown in Figure 2b–d.
