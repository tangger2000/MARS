CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The detailed properties of the   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics  are summarized in  Table   1 , where   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and   $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$   are determined  from the   $P{-}E$   loops, while   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$   are determined from  the current–electric field   $(I{-}E)$   curve as shown in Figure S2 \n\n (Supporting Information). It is found that   $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$   remains at \n\n  $35.5{-}37.2~\\upmu\\mathrm{C~cm}^{-2}$   for the compositions of   $x\\,=\\,0{-}15\\,\\mathrm{\\mol{\\%}}$  ,  slightly decreases to   $31.5~\\upmu\\mathrm{C}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at   $x=20~\\mathrm{mol}\\%$  , due to the  limitation of   $E_{\\flat}$  . Of particular significance is that the   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   is found  to decrease with increasing Ta addition, while both  $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$   are  found to exhibit a contrary trend, with the switching hysteresis   $\\Delta E$   maintaining the same values. The reduced   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and increased   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}/E_{\\mathrm{A}}$   reveal an enhanced anti ferro electricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$  ceramics, benefiting the energy storage density.  As expected,  all the   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics are found to possess higher   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}>3.0~\\mathrm{J}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   and   $\\eta>58\\%$   when compared to their pure  counterpart, as shown in Figure 1b, indicating the substitution  of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   for   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$   plays an important role in increasing energy  storage density and decreasing energy dissipation. The highest   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   up to   $4.2~\\mathrm{J~cm}^{-3}$  , an enhancement of   $260\\%$   over the pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramic, is achieved in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$   ceramics,  with good thermal stability of the energy storage density (minimal variation of   $\\mathord{<}\\pm5\\%$  ) over temperature range of   ${20}–120\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ,  as given in Figure 1c. The good thermal stability of the energy  storage density is attributed to the existence of  $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$   phase over a  broad temperature range, which has been tuned to room temperature by adding   $\\mathrm{AgTaO}_{3}$   component. With increasing temperature, the  $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$   phase is stabilized due to the fact that higher  temperature favors the short-range interaction and enhances  the AFE phase stability, playing a positive impact on the thermal  stability of the energy storage density. The energy storage densities of recently studied lead-free ceramics are summarized in  Figure 1d. It can be seen that the   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   of   $4.2\\ \\mathrm{J\\cm^{-3}}$   achieved  in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$   ceramic is superior to all other studied  lead-free ceramics,  demonstrating   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   is  a potential candidate for energy storage applications. To understand the underlying mechanism for the enhanced energy  storage density in  $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, the micro structure  observation, dielectric property measurement and polar state  study by SAED are performed on   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   solid solution.  \n\nA relative density above   $95\\%$   is obtained for all the samples, in addition, the   $\\mathrm{Ta}$  -doped ceramics are found to possess  smaller grain size comparing to pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   (  $2.5\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{{m}}$   in   $x=$   $20\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\%$   vs   $52~\\ensuremath{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   in   $x\\,=\\,0\\,\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\%)$  ), due to the refractory  nature of Ta,  as shown in small insets of  Figure   2 a. The  reduced grain size and high density would contribute to the  enhanced dielectric breakdown strength   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$  , which is a key  factor benefiting the high energy storage performance. The  data of   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   are plotted by Weibull distribution and given in  Figure 2b. The average   $E_{\\flat}$   determined by fitting lines is found  to increase with Ta addition, with values being on the order of  175 and   $240\\ensuremath{~\\mathrm{kV}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}$   for pure ceramics and   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.80}T a_{0.20})}$   $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  , respectively.  \n\nFigure 2c shows the variations of dielectric constant as  a function of temperature for pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics. It  is observed that the phase transitions for   $\\mathrm{M}_{1}–\\mathrm{M}_{2}\\left(T_{\\mathrm{M}_{1}-\\mathrm{M}_{2}}\\right)$  ,   $\\mathrm{M}_{2}–\\mathrm{M}_{3}\\left(T_{\\mathrm{M}_{2}-\\mathrm{M}_{3}}\\right)$  , and   $\\mathrm{M}_{3}–\\mathrm{O}$     $\\left(T_{\\mathrm{M_{3}-O}}\\right)$   occur approximately at 75,  262, and   $355~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , respectively. Same measurements were performed on   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, based on which, the  phase diagram is determined and plotted in Figure 2d. The  phase transition temperature   $T_{\\mathrm{O-T}}$   which relates to the oxygen  octahedron tilting, is found to increase with Ta addition, while   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{2}-M_{3}}}$   and   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{1}-M_{2}}}$  , which are associated with the cation (  $\\mathrm{Ag}$   and  Nb) displacements, exhibit contrary trend. Of particular interest  is that   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{3}-O}}$  , which is between   $T_{\\mathrm{O-T\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
