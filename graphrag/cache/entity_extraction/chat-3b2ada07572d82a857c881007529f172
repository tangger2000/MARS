MHPs are suitable for the emission layers in LEDs because MHPs  have: (i) a high photo luminescence  quantum efficiency (PLQE) (up to   $90\\%$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   nano particle (NP)  solution) , (ii) very narrow emission  linewidth (full width at half maximum   $(\\mathrm{FWHM})=16.5$   nm for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}\\mathrm{,}$  ),  (iii)  high charge-carrier mobility (electron  mobility  $\\mu_{{\\mathrm e}}\\,{\\approx}\\,1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   for  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    single crystals,    $4500\\;\\mathrm{\\cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{\\s}^{-1}$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}\\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{NPS}^{[9]})$  of Si   $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{e}}~\\approx~1000~\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  ,  and  (iv) low energetic disorder (trap density   $\\approx~1.13~\\times~10^{9}~\\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$  for   $\\mathrm{FAPbBr}_{3}$    single  crystals,   Urbach  energy   $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}=\\mathbf{\\Sigma}15{-}30\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\,\\mathrm{meV}^{[12,13]})$  . Furthermore, low  material cost, easy tuning of electronic  properties (e.g., bandgap) by simple sub  \n\nMetal halide per ovsk ites (MHPs) have numerous advantages as light emitters  such as high photo luminescence quantum efficiency with a direct bandgap,  very narrow emission linewidth, high charge-carrier mobility, low energetic  disorder, solution process ability, simple color tuning, and low material cost.  Based on these advantages, MHPs have recently shown unprecedented radical progress (maximum current efficiency from 0.3 to  ${\\bf42.9\\c d\\,A^{-1}})$  ) in the field  of light-emitting diodes. However, perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs)  suffer from intrinsic instability of MHP materials and instability arising from  the operation of the PeLEDs. Recently, many researchers have devoted efforts  to overcome these instabilities. Here, the origins of the instability in PeLEDs  are reviewed by categorizing it into two types: instability of (i) the MHP materials and (ii) the constituent layers and interfaces in PeLED devices. Then, the  strategies to improve the stability of MHP materials and PeLEDs are critically  reviewed, such as A-site cation engineering, Ruddlesden–Popper phase, suppression of ion migration with additives and blocking layers, fabrication of  uniform bulk poly crystalline MHP layers, and fabrication of stable MHP nanoparticles. Based on this review of recent advances, future research directions  and an outlook of PeLEDs for display applications are suggested.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nstitution of constituents, and applicability of diverse solution  processes at low temperature   $(<\\!100\\ ^{\\circ}{\\mathrm{C}})$   expand the potential  of MHP emitters for applications in large-area displays. Particularly, a remarkably wide color gamut arising from the  narrow emission linewidth of MHPs   $\\mathrm{\\{FWHM<20\\nm\\}}$  ) compared with those of organic emitters   $(\\mathrm{FWHM}\\approx40~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) and  inorganic quantum dot (QD) emitters   $(\\mathrm{FWHM}\\approx30~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) is a  distinct advantage of MHPs as alternative light emitters for  vivid natural-color displays.  \n\nMetal halide per ovsk ites (MHPs) have stimulated intense  research in the field of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and  researchers have achieved significant breakthroughs in the  electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of MHP LEDs (PeLEDs)  in only three years  $[1{-}5]$   MHPs are semiconducting materials  that have an   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   perovskite crystal structure where A is  an organic cation (e.g., methyl ammonium (MA)   ${\\mathrm{CH}}_{3}{\\mathrm{NH}}_{3}{}^{+}$  ,  \n\nResearch on PeLEDs that can exhibit bright EL at room  temperature began in 2014.  The EL efficiency was  moderate (maximum current efficiency   $\\mathrm{CE}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\;=\\;0.3^{[14]}$   and  0.577 cd   $\\mathsf{A}^{-1[15]}$  ), but these pioneering studies were enough to  arouse intense interest among many researchers in the field  of op to electronics. In fact, early PeLEDs based on MHP emission layers were reported before 2014, but they showed bright  EL only at cryogenic temperatures  or emitted from fluorescent organic dyes (leading to a broad EL with  $\\mathrm{FWHM}\\approx90\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  ),  not from corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{6}$   octahedra.  EL of PeLEDs that  was barely detectable by the naked eye at room temperature  was reported in 2011, but device efficiency could not be quantified because the brightness was too low.  The EL of PeLEDs  at room temperature is limited due to: (i) thermal dissociation  of excitons, (ii) slow bimolecular recombination caused by from  spin–orbit coupling (Rashba effect) and anisotropy of organic  A-site cations,  and (iii) the lack of optimal device structures  for efficient charge-carrier injection and balanced transport of  injected charge carriers. The thermal dissociation of generated  excitons suppresses geminate radiative recombination and thus  limits the luminescence efficiency. Also, large energy barriers  between MHP emission layers and charge-injection/transport  layers can reduce the efficiency of charge injection,  and  charge unbalance in the emission layers can retard radiative  recombination.  \n\nThe academic and technological background for fabricating  efficient and bright PeLEDs has been established, along with  developments of organic LEDs (OLEDs), QD LEDs, and MHP  solar cells (PeSCs) over decades. The great progress in OLEDs  and QD LEDs has provided effective strategies to construct  efficient light-emitting devices and has yielded in depth understanding of the excited-state properties of light emitters.   Furthermore, recent intensive research on PeSCs has provided  understanding of the electronic and structural properties  of MHPs, and effective methods to control the morphology of  MHP poly crystalline films.  Developments in these fields  have revitalized studies of PeLEDs and significantly increased  the EL efficiency and brightness.  \n\nThe recent rapid progress in EL efficiency of PeLEDs  has been unprecedented; the record EL efficiency of visible  PeLEDs steeply increased from   $\\mathrm{{CE}_{\\mathrm{{max}}}\\;=\\;0.3}$   to 42.9 cd   $\\mathsf{A}^{-1}$     (from maximum external quantum efficiency   $\\mathrm{EQE}_{\\mathrm{max}}=0.1\\%$    to   $8.53\\%$  ) within one and a half years.  The EL efficiency of  near-infrared PeLEDs also greatly increased from the initial  efficiency (from   $\\mathrm{EQE}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\,=\\,0.1\\%^{[14]}$  to   $10.4\\%^{[4]}$\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
