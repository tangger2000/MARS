Despite several decades pursuing, bi functional  oxygen catalysts with high catalytic performance at low-cost, especially the  one that could be easily scaled up for mass production are still missing and  highly desired. Herein, a hybrid catalyst with NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on N-doped carbon nanofibers is synthesized by a facile electro spinning method and post calcination treatment. The hybrid catalyst NiCo@N-C  2 exhibits outstanding ORR and OER catalytic performances, which is even  surprisingly superior to the commercial  ${\\mathsf{P}}{\\mathsf{t}}/{\\mathsf{c}}$   and  $\\mathtt{R u O}_{2}$   catalysts, respectively.  The synergetic effects between alloy nanoparticles and the N-doped carbon  fiber are considered as the main contributions for the excellent catalytic activities, which include decreasing the intrinsic and charge transfer resistances,  increasing  ${\\tt c}{=}{\\tt c}.$  , graphitic-N/pyridinic-N contents in the hybrid catalyst. This  work opens up a new way to fabricate high-efficient, low-cost oxygen catalysts  with high production.  \n\nbig challenges.  Alternative materials based on non precious  metal or metal-free materials have been intensively explored  as high efficient and low-cost oxygen catalysts for ORR and/or  OER, including carbon-based materials,  transition metal  oxides/hydroxides/sulfides  and their hybrids.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nWith the rapid development of economy and society, the  demand for energy has been dramatically increased. While  traditional fossil fuel energies are nonrenewable and  \n\nRecently, the alloy catalysts have also been widely studied  because of their highly active toward ORR, OER, and other catalytic reactions.  A large number of studies have shown that  the bimetallic alloy catalysts such as FeCo,  NiCo,  FeNi   exhibit superior activity in comparison to their individual entities, and the bonding between the two different metals can  constitute intrinsic polarity to promote catalytic reactions.   Among the various bimetallic alloys, NiCo alloy exhibits a  great application prospect because nickel and cobalt are earthabundant and environmental friendly. Moreover, it can provide  rich valence state changes, which are significant for ORR and  OER processes.  However, a lot of studies on non supported  bimetallic alloy catalysts manifest that they are still facing  the problem of poor conductivity.  Hybridizing with carbon  materials could enhance the conductivity of the alloy greatly.  Meanwhile, carbon materials can also be benefit for ORR, especially the one with heteroatoms doping, including monodoped,  dual codoped even triple-doped carbons with N, P, S, and so  on.  For instance, Singh et al. have reported a NiCo alloy  oxide supported N-doped porous graphene as a high-performance OER electro catalyst.  Nevertheless, it is known that the  synthesis of graphene is quite tedious with low-efficiency and  high-cost.  \n\nHerein, we show that NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated  on N-doped carbon nanofibers, synthesized via a facile electrospinning method and followed by calcination, as high efficient,  low-cost, and stable catalysts for ORR and OER processes in  alkaline solution. The whole fabrication process is quite simple  and scalable with low-cost. The hybrid catalyst with suitable  loading of NiCo alloy   $(\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2)$  ) exhibits the best electrocatalytic activities and st abilities for both the ORR and OER  processes, which are even superior to the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   catalysts, respectively. This simple, fast, and cost-effective  approach sheds light on the synthesis of low-cost, high efficient  bi functional oxygen catalysts with mass production for various  renewable energy systems including fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and water splitting.  \n\n# 2. Results and Discussion  \n\nThe NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on N-doped carbon  nanofibers   $\\mathrm{(NiCo@N-C~}$   NFs) were synthesized by a simple electro spinning process, followed by heat treatment in   $\\Nu_{2}$   atmosphere. The NiCo  $@\\mathrm{N.C}$   NFs with different alloys loading could  be facilely adjusted and controlled by adding different amount  of nickel and cobalt salts (with constant molar ratio of 1:2 for   $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}{:}C o^{2+}})$   in the electro spinning precursor solutions (details  of the synthesis could be seen in Experimental Section). The  morphology and structure of the synthesized materials were  first characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  ( Figure   1 a–d). Figure 1a shows that there are no NiCo alloy particles on the carbon fibers visually for the sample   $\\mathrm{N{-}C_{:}}$  , which  adding no metal salts in the precursor solution. All the carbon  fibers with a diameter of about   $1\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   are tangled with each other.  Figure 1b–d represent the other samples which are successfully decorated with NiCo alloy nanoparticles on carbon fibers  with adding different amount of metal salts in the precursor  solution.

There are obviously small  amount of nanoparticles distributed on the carbon nanofibers  with diameter of   ${\\approx}50\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . Meanwhile, surprisingly the diameter of the carbon nanofibers has been shrunken to 100–200  nm after decorated with alloy nanoparticles.
