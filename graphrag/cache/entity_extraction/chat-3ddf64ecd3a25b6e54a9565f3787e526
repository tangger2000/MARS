Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Nevertheless, there remain  intrinsic shortfalls of   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   that hamper its practical applications. The following section is to compare the pros and cons of  emerging thermo responsive materials with   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  .  \n\nFirst, the pure   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   system displays a limited   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   that is  commonly lower than   $20\\%$   with an acceptable   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$   of   $50\\%$  . This is largely attributed to the negligible optical modulations  in the visible range, where nearly half of solar energy exists  (Figure  8b). However, emerging materials such as hydrogels  display excellent control within both the NIR and visible ranges  (Figure 8b), giving to significantly enhanced performance in  solar energy regulation. For example, PINIPAm-based thermochromic films were demonstrated to have an optimized   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$  of   ${\\approx}26\\%$   upon a   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$   above   $70\\%$  ,  which surpassed the best  reported   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  -based thermo chromic films,  including those  produced with controlled porosity,  n another m och rom is m, moth-eyed nano structure, anti reflective over coating,  as well  as doping  and nano g riding methods (Figure  8c).  The  hybrid combining  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   and PNIPAm also displayed a high level  of performance that could not be achieved by the pure   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  system (Figure  8c).  Thermo chromic perovskite and reconfigured meta materials have also demonstrated visible light control but the quantitative optical calculations are missing and  more researches are needed in those two categories. It is reasonable to consider these materials as promising candidates for  solar energy modulation.  \n\nSecondly, accurate control to tune the optical intensity in specific spectral ranges is a desirable approach in thermo chromic  smart window materials due to the nonuniform distribution  of the solar spectral irradiance (Figure  8b). Recent research  on   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   has achieved precise control, wherein a size-controlled  preparation method for patterned   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   nanoparticles was  achieved using a sacrificial colloidal template (Figure 8d).  An  emerging extinction peak was observed upon increasing temperature (Figure 8e), known to be the localized surface plasmon  resonance (LSPR) that occurs on particles with constrained size  on the nanoscale (commonly less than   $100~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  ).  The position of the LSPR could be tuned from 1120 to   $1360\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   by con- trolling the particle size and the reflective index of the medium  (Figure  8f). This work indicates the possibility of promoting  solar modulation efficiency by tuning the absorption position  to the range with densest solar energy. Compared with the wellstudied  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  , emerging materials have displayed a lower degree  of control l ability in terms of the position and intensity of the  responsive spectral range. For example, the PNIPAm hydrogel  blocked a broad spectral range of   $250{-}2500\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , leading to  white opaque appearance while the transparency is needed in  many glass applications.  This issue may be tackled if the  size and arrangement of polymer clusters could be controlled to  selectively scatter the incident light in a narrow spectral range.  \n\nThirdly, the transition temperature range of emerging thermo responsive materials is suitable and easily process able.  The   $\\tau_{c}$     $(68\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   of typical   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   is too high for smart window  applications. Although methods such as doping can reduce  the   $\\tau_{\\mathtt{C}},$   these methods are commonly achieved via crystallographic engineering and are accompanied by some sacrifice  of thermo chromic properties.  On the other hand, all the  reported hydrogels, thermo responsive per ovsk ites, reconfigured meta materials, and liquid crystals show suitable transition  temperatures, starting from   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . In addition, their different  transition mechanisms offer more freedom to modify their  transition temperatures with the potential not to jeopardize  their optical performance. For example, the heat-shrinkable  tapes determine the transition temperature range while contributing little to the optical properties of programmable kiri-kirigami meta materials.  These tapes can be changed according  to specific circumstances.  \n\nFinally, durability must also be considered in real applications.  A challenge of   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   is its weak resistance to ox i diz ation, and emerging thermo responsive materials have not yet demonstrated sufficient durability. For example, thermo responsive  perovskite displayed an obvious band gap variation within less  than 10 heating–cooling cycles.  Although a few emerging  thermo responsive materials studies have considered their durability, these tests were far from adequate for real applications.  It is believed that improvements to prolong durability are necessary for all these emerging thermo responsive materials.  \n\n# 3.
