CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

A  $450\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  laser was used to excite samples, which was placed on a piezo-crystalcontrolled scanning stage.  \n\nX-Ray Detection : The used   $\\mathsf X$  -ray source is a soft-X-ray beamline in  Australia Synchrotron. The energy range is about 100–2500 eV, which  is suitable for study the   $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray detecting properties of the perovskite  as the X-ray radiation is effectively absorbed inside the   $600\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m}$  film. The dose rate was measured by a portable Radiation Monitor  Controller (Radcal Corporation Model 9010). The effective area can  refer to the focal spot size at the sample which is about   $0.0006\\ {\\mathsf{c m}}^{2}$  The device with two copper wires was mounted on the sample holder  with a glass slide as an insulation in between. The wires were linked  with two pinholes on the sample holder, which have dedicated  electrical contact to export the current to the Keithley source meter  (2400 series) for the current/voltage measurement. The current vs.  voltage and current vs. time were recorded by Quick IV measurement  software.  \n\nFor the hard-X-ray-detection measurements in the X-ray platform,  the used   $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray source is the Bruker D8 discover diffract o meter with   $\\textsf{C u}\\,K\\alpha$  Radiation   $(8~\\mathsf{k e V})$   runs at   $40~\\mathrm{kV}$   and  $40~\\mathsf{m A}$  .
