CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

Brabec, Hin-Lap Yip,\\* and Yong Cao  \n\nlong carrier-diffusion lengths.  Certi- fied power conversion efficiency (PCE)  of perovskite solar cells (PVSC) had skyrocketed over   $23\\%$   during the past several  years.  In spite of their high efficiencies,  the volatile nature and thermal instability  of organic cations could hinder further  commercial applications of organic–inor- ganic PVSCs. Alternatively, cesium-based  inorganic per ovsk ites   $(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  ,   $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{~X~}}=\\mathrm{~I~}$  ,  Br, and Cl) have drawn increasing attention owing to their excellent thermal sta- bility.  Substitution of organic cations  (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{[(NH_{2})_{2}C H]^{+}}$  ,   ${\\mathrm{CH}}_{3}{\\mathrm{NH}}_{3}{}^{+})$  ) with   $C s^{+}$    could enhance the interaction between  the inorganic   $\\mathrm{[PbX_{6}]^{4-}}$   framework and A  site cation, enabling inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   perovskite semiconductors to be  composition ally stable even at   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  .  \n\nA synergic interface design is demonstrated for photos table inorganic mixedhalide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by applying an amino-functional i zed  polymer (PN4N) as cathode interlayer and a dopant-free hole-transporting  polymer poly[5,  $\\mathbf{5^{\\prime}}$  -bis(2-butyloctyl)-  $^{[2,2^{\\prime}}$  -bit hio phe ne)-  $^{.4,4^{\\prime}}$  -di carboxyl atealt -  $\\mathbf{5,}\\mathbf{5^{\\prime}}\\mathbf{\\cdot}\\mathbf{2,}\\mathbf{2^{\\prime}}$  -bit hio phe ne] (PDCBT) as anode interlayer. First, the inter facial dipole  formed at the cathode interface reduces the work function of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  , while  PDCBT with deeper-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level  provides a better energy-level matching at the anode, leading to a significant  enhancement in open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\infty})$   of the PVSCs. Second, the PN4N  layer can also tune the surface wetting property to promote the growth of  high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films with larger grain size and higher  crystal lin it y. Most importantly, both theoretical and experimental results  reveal that PN4N and PDCBT can interact strongly with the perovskite  crystal, which effectively passivates the electronic surface trap states and suppresses the photoinduced halide segregation of  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films. Therefore,  the optimized  $\\mathsf{c s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PVSCs exhibit reduced inter facial recombination with  efficiency over  $16\\%$  , which is one of the highest efficiencies reported for allinorganic PVSCs. A high photo stability with a less than  $10\\%$   efficiency drop  is demonstrated for the  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PVSCs with dual inter facial modifications  under continuous 1 sun equivalent illumination for  $\\mathbf{400\\,\\mathfrak{h}}$  .  \n\n$\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$    in  cubic  crystal  structure  (  $\\alpha$  phase) showed an optical bandgap   $(E_{\\mathrm{g}})$   of   $1.73~\\mathrm{eV},$  , which is appealing as the  top cell for perovskite/silicon tandem  solar cells.  However, its low Goldschmidt tolerance factor   $({\\approx}0.81)$   results  in severe octahedral rotation distortion,  which spontaneously transforms from  \n\nOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite semiconductors have  emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic materials owing to their excellent op to electronic properties such  as high absorption coefficient, facile tunable bandgaps, and  \n\n$\\alpha$  phase into the undesired   $\\delta$  phase (yellow phase) under  ambient conditions at room temperature.

Most recently, Zhao and  co-workers demonstrated the PTABr surface termination on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   could realize an impressive PCE of   $17.06\\%$  .  Given  that halide substitution can increase the Goldschmidt tolerance  factor toward a more stabilized cubic lattice structure, there  are increasing efforts focused on another inorganic mixedhalide   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite with an optical   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   of   $1.92~\\mathrm{eV}.$   The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite semiconductor has been successfully  applied in thermo chromic and photovoltaic devices benefiting  from its improved structural stability in the cubic phase compares to the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   counterpart.  Further optimization of  the device architecture and perovskite film showed encouraging  efficiency of  $16.07\\%$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs.  \n\nWhile the partial substitution of   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   with smaller   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   can  modulate the Goldschmidt tolerance factor and stabilize the  inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   cubic phase, it has been reported that the  mixed-halide per ovsk ites are highly susceptible to photoinduced  halide segregation, leading to the decay of photovoltaic performances.  Upon illumination, segregation of halides results  in the formation of Br-rich and I-rich perovskite phases mediated by the atom diffusion through halogen vacancies, which  occurs on the time scale of seconds for organic–inorganic  hybrid per ovsk ites.  In addition, state-of-the-art inorganic  PVSCs still employ doped hole-transporting layers (HTLs) such  as Spiro-OMeTAD with additives such as cobalt complexes,  4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) and lithium salts. However, TBP and  lithium salts can induce severe degradation processes within  the device.  Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop new  strategy to improve the long-term operational stability of mixedhalide inorganic PVSCs by suppressing the photoinduced  degradation within the perovskite layer before they can be  considered for viable applications.  \n\nToward the goal of enhancing the efficiency and stability  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs, we systematically investigated the effects  of inter facial engineering on the surface defect pass iv ation,  photoinduced phase segregation, morphology control, charge  recombination property, and device efficiency by introducing  an amino-functional i zed polymer (PN4N) as a novel cathode  interlayer\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
