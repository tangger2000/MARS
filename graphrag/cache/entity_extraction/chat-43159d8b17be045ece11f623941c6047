CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is well known that the trap  density levels are continuously filled in the trap-filled limited  region and all the traps are filled until trap-filled limit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$   as bias increases. The trap density can be calculated  using an equation of   $n_{\\mathrm{t}}=(2\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}})/(e L^{2})$  , where   $\\varepsilon$  is the dielectric constants of perovskite,   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity,  e is the elementary charge, and   $L$   is the thickness of perovskite  film.   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is obtained by fitting the dark   $I{-}V$  curves. The  dielectric constant of the perovskite is calculated according to   $\\varepsilon=(C_{\\mathrm{g}}L)/(\\varepsilon_{0}A),^{[37]}$   where   $C_{\\mathrm{g}}$  is the geometrical capacitance of  perovskite layer,   $L$   is the thickness of the perovskite film, and  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/33fb34b9001c58e9341266addb065acbb603dbe8cb0956ea2f110ca0e8f7a21c-1723834540.jpg)  \nFigure 5.   Dark   $I{-}V$  curves of electron-only devices: a)  $\\mathsf{F T O}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/$  perovskite/PCBM/Ag and b)   $\\mathsf{F T O}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -IL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag.   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -IL stands for  the ImAcHCl modified   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  . c)  $V_{\\mathrm{{oc}}}$   versus light intensity plots of PSCs based on  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  -IL. d) Nyquist plots of the PSCs based on   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2^{-}}|\\mathsf{L}$  , obtained with a bias of   $0.6~\\forall$   in the frequency range of 1 MHz to   $0.1\\ \\mathsf{H}z$   under 1 sun illumination. The equivalent circuit used for fitting is  illustrated in the inset. e) Charge transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$   and   $\\mathsf{f})$   recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$   as a function of applied voltage, extracted from the  Nyquist plots.  \n\nthe  $A$   is the active areas of the electron-only device.    $C_{\\mathrm{g}}$   is  obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of device   $\\mathrm{FTO}/\\$  perovskite/Au. After modification of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   with ImAcHCl, the  defect density of perovskite film is reduced from   $5.96\\times10^{15}$   to   $3.17\\times10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . In addition, from the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   versus light intensity measurement in Figure  5c, the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -IL device shows  much lower slope   $(1.51\\ k T/q)$   as compared to the control device \n\n  $\\left(1.98\\,\\,\\,k T/q\\right)$  . Since the deviation of the slope from unity   $k T/q$  (where  $k$   is the Boltzmann constant,   $T$  stands for the absolute  temperature and   $q$   represents the elementary charge) reflects  trap-assisted non radiative recombination (Shockley–Read– Hall (SRH)) in PSCs,  the lower value estimated for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}\\mathrm{{-}I L}}$   is indicative of reduced trap-assisted non radiative  recombination. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement has been extensively employed  to gain deep insight into inter facial charge transfer and rec ombination.  Nyquist plots of the devices with and  without ImAcHCl modification were measured under a bias of   $0.6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   in the frequency range of   $1\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$   to   $0.1\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$   under one  sun illumination at room temperature (Figure 5d). Two semicircles are clearly observed. It was reported that the semicircle  in the high-frequency region is closely related with the charge  transfer and transportation resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$   and the semicircle  in the low-frequency region is put down to recombination  resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$  .  As shown in Figure  S13 in the Supporting Information, series resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{s}})$   is slightly increased  after modification with ImAcHCl pas siva ting layer. Figure 5e,f  shows the   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$   and   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   as a function of applied voltages, where  the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -IL device exhibits reduced   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$   and increased   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   as  compared to those for the control device. This indicates that  electron extraction is improved and interface recombination is  reduced by the introduction of ImAcHCl on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  .  \n\nDevice stability is compared, where   $J{-}V$  curves are measured under the ambient condition with relative humidity  ranging between  $40\\%$   and   $60\\%$  . Considering the poor thermal  stability of spiro-MeOTAD-based PSCs,  we replace spiroMeOTAD with poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) especially for  investigating thermal stability. The un encapsulated devices  with or without ImAcHCl modification are heated at   $85\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  in the dark in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. As can be seen  in Figure S14 in the Supporting Information,   $90\\%$   of its initial PCE is maintained for the ImAcHCl-modified device  after   $40\\textrm{h}$   aging, while PCE is degraded by   $53\\%$   for the control device.  Figure    6  shows the moisture stability of devices   $(\\mathrm{FTO}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   or   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -IL/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au) stored  in the ambient condition in the dark at room temperature.  The un encapsulated device with ImAcHCl treatment retains   $94\\%$   of its initial PCE after 35 days, while the control device  maintains only   $79\\%$   of its initial PCE. Reduced interface  defects and thereby reduced interface non radiative recombination could be one of the main reasons for the improvement  of thermal and moisture endurance. The improved stability  by multi functional ImAcHCl linker is probably due to the  reduced interface defects.  \n\nChemical linker with desired functions was found to improve  photovoltaic performance, reduce current–voltage hysteresis,  and enhance stability in perovskite solar cell. ImAcHCl can provide a chemical bridge between   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and perovskite through  an ester bond with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   via an esterification reaction between  carboxylic acid in ImAcHCl and hydroxyl group in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/e30b87f3435eebaa9382a7ebe5df37d42b15c4e1c737fb0450dad4c43c296eaf-1723834534.jpg)  \nFigure 6.  $J_{\\mathsf{s c}},$   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$  , c) FF, and d) PCE of the un encapsulated PSCs with the unmodified  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and the ImAcHCl modified   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   $(\\mathsf{S n O}_{2^{\\cdot}}\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
