CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

In  Figure   6 a, the C 1s spectra of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   could be de convoluted  into three independent peaks at 284.7, 285.2, and   $286.8\\ \\mathrm{eV},$    which are related to   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$  ,   $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{C=O}$  , respectively.   And the corresponding area ratios of different peaks are   $45.9\\%$  ,   $25.1\\%$  , and   $29\\%$  , respectively. Comparing, the C 1s  spectra of   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   (Figure 6c) shows three peaks with  almost the same binding energies. However, the area ratios of  each peak have a remarkable change, which are   $62.3\\%$  ,   $35.1\\%$  ,  and   $2.6\\%$  , respectively. In particular, the content of   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=C}}$    increased from   $45.9\\%$   to   $62.3\\%$  , while the oxygen-associated  carbon configuration shows the opposite trend. In   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N}.$  - C 2, there are less defects in the   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$   framework and higher  degree of graph it iz ation, which would bring a positive effect  on the electronic conductivity of the material and be beneficial  for the electro catalytic performance.  Thereby,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$    2 exhibits the enhanced ORR and OER electro catalytic performance compared to   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$  . The N 1s spectra of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}2$   are shown in Figure 6b,d, respectively. The proportions of nitrogen doping could be calculated to be   $6.2\\%$    and   $2.87\\%$   for   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$  , respectively. The two  N 1s spectra could both be divided into pyridinic N, pyrrolic  N, graphitic N, and oxidized N with similar binding energies,  respectively.  The percentage of graphitic N/pyridinic N is a  judging standard for catalytic activity by enhancing the electronic conductivity of the materials.  In this work, the ratio  of graphitic N/pyridinic N increased from 0.64 to 2.46, after  loading with moderate NiCo alloy nanoparticles, which could  be ascribed to the improvement of catalytic activity. Moreover,  an additional Co-coordinated N with relatively high intensity  has been obtained in   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$  2   $(398.9\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{eV}})$  , which is also  known to be catalytic ally active for ORR.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/6c2beefa5fd97153eee4acc20f5d174689e02badfe804d7851b33f28c43fcd19-1727077615.jpg)  \nFigure 6.   XPS spectra: a) C 1s and b) N 1s of N  C; c) C 1s and d) N 1s of NiCo  $@$  N-C 2.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/196ff22e27766b2a06d9aa08bca5e5ba7bd0685d8b57cc8cfc363a407fc85e27-1727077587.jpg)  \nFigure 7.   a) Co 2p, b) Ni 2p, c) O 1s, and d) C 1s  $\\mathsf{X P S}$   spectra of  $\\mathsf{N i C o@N\\cdot C}~2$   before and after OER stability measurements.  \n\nXPS was further conducted on   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\ \\ 2$   before and  after OER stability measurement, the results are shown in  Figure   7 .

In Co   $2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$  , the metallic state of Co  can be affirmed by the peak centered at   $779.74~\\mathrm{eV}$   as shown in  the fitted spectrum of Co before OER.   ${\\bf C}{\\boldsymbol0}^{2+}$   locates at the outer  surface of NiCo alloy nanoparticles owing to the exposure to  air.

While in Figure   $7\\mathrm{b}$   for   $\\mathrm{Ni}~2\\mathrm{p}$   spectra, before OER Ni   $2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$   at  855.1 eV could be divided into metallic state of Ni (853.9 eV)  and   $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}$     $(855.9\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}})$  , and   $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}$   comes from the partial oxidation of the outside surface of NiCo alloy.  While after OER,  Ni   $2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$   could be divided into   $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}$     $(855.9\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   and   $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}}$  (856.2  eV). After OER stability testing,   $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}\\;2p_{3/2}}$   has been emerged  and the intensity of  $\\mathrm{Ni}^{3+}\\,2\\mathrm{p}_{3/2}$   is much stronger than   $\\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\\,2\\mathrm{p}_{3/2}$  ,  which indicates that   $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}}$   takes up a large part on the surface of  the sample and it is beneficial for oxygen evolution to enhance  OER activity.  And the metallic state of Co and Ni are both  found in the XPS spectra, which can further indicate that the  nanoparticles on the N doped carbon nanofibers are NiCo alloy.  In addition, Figure 7c shows the O 1s spectra, in which O1  is fitted to the surface defect sites with low oxygen coordination, and O2 is related to the   $\\mathrm{O{-}H}$   groups.  After OER stability measurement, O2 significantly enhanced compared with  O1. The peak located at   $536.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   after OER comes from the  Nafion binder (seen in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). The O 1s XPS results indicate that during OER process,  NiCo alloy has been hydroxyl a ted because the rich   ${C0}^{3+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}}$   might be beneficial to form the surface-hydrated oxides  and (oxy)hydroxides phases (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{Co(OH)}_{2},$  , CoOOH,   $\\mathrm{Ni(OH)}_{2}.$  ,  and NiOOH).  And those surface-hydrated oxides and (oxy) hydroxides species could provide the main reactive sites, which  might attribute to the enhancement during the OER process of  the sample with the loading of NiCo\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
