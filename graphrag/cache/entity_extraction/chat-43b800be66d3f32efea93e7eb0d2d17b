CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals coated with zirconium oxide, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>Synthesis method<|>Modified method used to obtain CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsBr<|>Reagent<|>Cesium bromide, a source of cesium ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbBr2<|>Reagent<|>Lead bromide, a source of lead ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve CsBr and PbBr2, abbreviated as DMF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OAm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Intermediate product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals formed before ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>Precursor<|>Zirconium butoxide, precursor for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZrO2<|>Coating material<|>Zirconium oxide, used to coat CsPbBr3 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Room temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the synthesis was carried out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.4 mmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of PbBr2 and CsBr used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of DMF used to dissolve PbBr2 and CsBr)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.2 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OAm used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.6 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OA used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1500 rpm<|>Reaction condition<|>Speed of vigorous stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10s<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>60 µmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 used for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8500 rpm<|>Purification condition<|>Speed of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 min<|>Purification condition<|>Duration of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The modified super saturated recrystallization method is used to synthesize CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsBr<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>CsBr is a source of cesium ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbBr2<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>PbBr2 is a source of lead ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CsBr<|>DMF is used to dissolve CsBr<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbBr2<|>DMF is used to dissolve PbBr2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OA acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OAm acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Toluene acts as an antisolvent to induce the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>ZrO2<|>Zr(OC4H9)4 is the precursor for ZrO2 coating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZrO2<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>ZrO2 forms a coating on CsPbBr3 NCs to create CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Room temperature<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs is carried out at room temperature<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm is used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Centrifugation at 8500 rpm is used to purify CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: rons with black  contrast, distributed randomly in the matrix, can be observed in  the BEM image (referred to as spinel phase); their size ranged  from several to tens of micrometers.

All  six metal elements (Fe, Co, Ni, Mg, Cu, and   $\\mathrm{Cr}$  ) and O were  spread across the observable region, as evident from dark field  scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) maps combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS)  \n\nof HE-Cr-1300 (Figure 2d). Uneven elemental distribution suggests that two phase components were formed in HE oxide  ceramics. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images illustrate  that HE-Cr-1300 consists of spinel and perovskite structures  (Figure  2e,f); moreover, crystalline-crystalline phase boundaries were observed. The clear lattice fringe spacings of 0.24 and   $0.48\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   can be attributed to the (110) and (111) planes of the  perovskite and spinel phases, respectively. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) images further confirmed the formation of double  spinel and perovskite structural phases (Figure S11, Supporting  Information). Abundant structural defects, including discontinuous lattice fringes, lattice stacking faults, and point defects,  are evident in the enlarged HRTEM images (Figure  2g–i). In  addition, based on atomic lattice image (Figure  2j) along the  (111) lattice planes of red-cubic region in (i), one can notice that  the significant lattice distortion was formed close to the heterointerfaces. The   $c$   lattice strain (  $\\varepsilon_{\\gamma\\gamma}$   strain, Figure 2k) was calculated by the GPA method, and the corresponding strain mapping demonstrated a high fraction of strain, suggesting that the  dramatic strain was generated in spinel/perovskite HE oxides.  These findings are consistent with the aforementioned TEM  results, thus further verifying the “rich structural defect” characteristic, which is responsible for EM wave dissipation due  to intense polarization from lattice distortion, lattice stacking  faults, and point defects.  \n\nSpinel/perovskite HE oxides exhibited para magnetic properties (Figure S12, Supporting Information), illustrating the existence of feeble magnetic loss under EM irradiation. Figure   $^{2\\mathrm{l},\\mathrm{m}}$  ,  and Figure S13 (Supporting Information) present the 2D reflection loss (RL) curves and EAB values of as-prepared spinel/ perovskite HE oxides. HE-Cr-1300 demonstrated the best EM  wave absorption performance; it could achieve a minimum RL  value of  $-30.7$   dB with a matching thickness of   $3.2~\\mathrm{mm}$  ; moreover, it exhibited an optimum EAB of   $3.6\\;\\mathrm{GHz}$   at  $2.8\\;\\mathrm{mm}$   thickness. For HE-Cr-1100 and HE-Cr-1200, the   $R L_{\\mathrm{min}}$   values were   $-4.6$   and  $-6.8\\;\\mathrm{dB}$  , respectively, demonstrating inferior EM wave  absorption performance. Moreover, HE-Cr-1400 demonstrated  an  $R L_{\\mathrm{min}}$    and  EAB  of  − 18.7 dB   $(3.3\\;\\mathrm{mm})$  ) and  $2.8\\:\\mathrm{GHz}$     $(3.0\\;\\mathrm{mm})$  ),  respectively. In addition, as summarized in Figure 2n, the comparison results further demonstrate the extraordinary comprehensive microwave absorption performances compared to previously reported representative perovskite  and spinel-based components, which can act as an ideal candidate for high-performance structural EM wave absorbing materials. The EM  parameters of spinel/perovskite HE oxides, including the real (  $\\cdot\\varepsilon^{\\prime}$  and  $\\mu^{\\prime}$  ) and imaginary (  $\\cdot\\varepsilon^{\\prime\\prime}$   and   $\\mu^{\\prime\\prime}$  ) parts are shown in Figure S14  (Supporting Information). Owning to the absence of strong  magnetic characteristics, we have not included discussions  related to the complex permeability in the spinel/perovskite  HE oxides. Herein, we concentrated on the real   $(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})$   and imaginary   $(\\varepsilon^{\\prime\\prime})$   parts, symbolizing the capability of storing and dissipating electric energy, respectively. As the sintering temperature increased, the   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}$   value of the sample increased because the  increase in oxygen vacancies resulted in more defective energy  levels and reduced bandgap, thus enhancing the conductivity.  The slight decrease in the dielectric constant of the HE-Cr1400 sample may be attributed to the more boundaries from  the decrease of crystal grain in He-Cr-1400 and reverse electric field radiated by the carriers in the directional flow. Note  that the values of   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}$   and   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime\\prime}$   for HE-Cr-1300 are at a high level,  demonstrating its good electric energy storage and dissipation  abilities. Additionally, the values of   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}$   and   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime\\prime}$   for the HE samples gradually decreased, with the development of resonance  peaks as the frequency increased, thus demonstrating the existence of various polarization relaxation mechanisms (inter facial  polarization and dipole polarization).  The Debye relaxation  process, which is connected to interface polarization or dipole  polarization, is typically represented by semicircles in the   $\\varepsilon{\\mathrm{-}}\\varepsilon^{\\prime\\prime}$    curve.  It is evident that each Cole–Cole diagram of HE oxides  consists of several distinct semicircles, as shown in Figure S15  (Supporting Information), and HE-Cr-1300 comprises three  clear semicircles, illustrating the strongest Debye relaxation  process, which is responsible for the highest   $\\varepsilon^{\\prime\\prime}$   values. Apart  from the EM energy dissipation ability, impedance matching  characteristics also significantly affect the EM wave absorption  properties. The relative input impedance   $(|Z_{i n}/Z_{0}|)$   is always  used to evaluate impedance matching. The ideal   $|Z_{i n}/Z_{0}|$   value  is 1, signifying that EM waves can enter the absorber without  reflection on the air-absorber interface.  It can be observed  that the impedance matching area of   $0.8\\,\\leq\\,\\bigl|Z_{i n}/Z_{0}\\b\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
