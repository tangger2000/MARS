CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

In comparison, the average transmittance s of   $\\mathrm{{Sno}_{2}}$  -DLCH samples at 400, 625, and  $700\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   were 0.843, 0.892, and 0.878, respectively (Figure    $\\mathrm{S4g-j}$  , Supporting Information), which were higher than that of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  sample. In order to better demonstrate the uniformity of the surface transmittance of the sample, we intercepted a small part of the data in Figure  S4b–d,g–j  (Supporting Information) and displayed them in the form of contour maps in Figure  S4e–g,j–l (Supporting Information) respectively. Figure  S4e–g  (Supporting Information) shows that the average transmittance of the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  sample at 400, 625 and   $700\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   is 0.845, 0.877, and 0.859 respectively. Figure  S4j–l  (Supporting Information) shows that the average transmittance of the  $\\mathrm{{Sno}_{2}}$  -DLCH sample at 400, 625 and  $700\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   is 0.845, 0.902 and 0.889 respectively. After DLCH adjustment, the light transmittance increased, which is consistent with the UV–vis light transmittance results in Figure  S5a  (Supporting Information). It is important to note that the light intensity  \n\non the surface of the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   sample is very uneven, which may be due to the loss of light transmission caused by the agglomeration and defects of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  . In comparison, the light intensity of the  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -DLCH sample is more uniform, which may be due to the suppression of agglomeration and reduction of defects after DLCH modi cation. It can be concluded that photons in ETL can be managed through DLCH modulation.  \n\nThe chemical interaction of DLCH with   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   or perovskite was investigated by performing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As depicted in  Figure  2 a , both pristine and modiﬁed   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ﬁlms exhibited discernible  $\\mathrm{Sn}\\,3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and Sn   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   peaks. Evidently, a noticeable shift in the binding energies of these peaks can be observed from 487.3   $(\\mathrm{Sn\\3d}_{5/2})$  ) and   $495.7~\\mathrm{eV}$     $(\\mathrm{Sn\\3d}_{3/2})$  for the bare   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ﬁlm to 486.1 and   $494.5~\\mathrm{eV}$   for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ﬁlm modiﬁed with DLCH, respectively. This shift strongly suggests a chemical interaction between DLCH and  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  . The O 1s peaks in the bare and modiﬁed   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ﬁlms have been successfully deconvoluted into a pair of distinct peaks (Figure  2b,c ). Spec i call y, the peak situated at a lower binding energy is attributed to the lattice oxygen   $(\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{L}})$   of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  , while the peak positioned at a higher binding energy corresponds to the vacancy oxygen   $(\\mathrm{O_{V}})$  . ]   The ratio of peak areas   $(\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{ov}})$  , reﬂecting  $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}}$   content, was determined using the approach outlined in our prior work. 19 ]   The calculated  $R_{\\mathrm{ov}}$   values for both the unmodiﬁed and DLCH-modiﬁed samples were 0.56 and 0.36, respectively. This shows that a notable decline in the concentration of oxygen vacancy defects was realized after DLCH modi cation. These ﬁndings collectively reinforced the chemical interaction between the DLCH and the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ﬁlm. The FTIR full spectra of the pristine and modiﬁed   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ﬁlms are exhibited in Figure  S6  (Supporting Information). It can be seen in Figure  2d  that the   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$   stretching vibration peak of DLCH   $(1743\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$  ) was shifted toward a lower wavenumber for\n\n  $\\mathrm{DLGH}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   $(1738\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ). In Figure  2e , the -SH peak of DLCH\n\n  $(2549\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ) was moved to a higher wavenumber   $(2552\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ) after mixing with  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  . This shows that   $\\scriptstyle\\cdot C=0$   and  $-S\\mathrm{H}$   jointly participated in the coordination of uncoordinated   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$    in the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ﬁlm. After the uncoordinated  $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$    was reduced, the  $\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}}$   vacancy was naturally suppressed, which is consistent with reduced oxygen vacancy defects as revealed by the O 1s XPS result. To gain deeper insights into the interaction between the functional group in DLCH molecules and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  , we conducted    $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$   NMR spectra measurements (Figure  2f ). The  $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$   NMR analysis demonstrated a chemical shift alteration from 170.37 to 170.40 ppm subsequent to the mixing of DLCH with  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  . The aforementioned  $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$   NMR ﬁndings once more substantiated the chemical interaction between  $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$   and  $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  , aligning coherently with the previous XPS and FTIR results.  \n\nSubsequently, we further explored the interaction between perovskite and DLCH. From Figure    $2\\mathrm{g}$  , the control perovskite ﬁlm exhibited two peaks at137.44 and   $142.30\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   corresponding to   $\\mathrm{Pb}\\ 4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   and Pb   $4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2}$  , respectively, which were shifted to lower binding energies following the DLCH modi cation (137.00 and   $141.90~\\mathrm{eV})$  ). This observation indicates a robust chemical interaction between DLCH and perovskite. The shift may occur because  $\\mathrm{-C=O}$   and    $-S\\mathrm{H}$   coordinated with uncoordinated  $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  , and   ${\\cdot}{\\mathrm{NH}}_{3}{^+}$   formed hydrogen bonds with unsaturated iodide ions in the perovskite. The FT-IR spectra of the DLCH and perovskite ﬁlm with DLCH are exhibited in Figure  2h-j  and Figure  S7  (Supporting Information). After interacting with perovskite, the stretching vibration peaks of  $\\mathrm{-C=O}$     $(1743\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ), 11 ]  $-S\\mathrm{H}$     $(2553\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ), 36 ]   and  $-\\mathrm{NH}_{3}{}^{+}$     $(3407\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})^{[37]}$   in DLCH were shifted to 1589, 2596, and   $3421~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , respectively. The formation of   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathsf{S}$   bond   $(468\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})$  ) was also found (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). Taken together, the XPS and FT-IR results together indicate that both  $\\mathrm{-C=O}$   and  $-S\\mathrm{H}$   in DLCH have the ability to chemically interact with under coordinated  $\\mathrm\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
