For now, precious metalbased electro catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity, but the high cost and rare  storage seriously hindered their large-scale  commercial applications.  Therefore, it is  an emergency to develop highly efficient  non-noble  bi functional  electro catalysts  to simultaneously accelerate the sluggish  HER/OER kinetic processes.  \n\nDeveloping non-noble-metal electro catalysts with high activity and low cost  for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction  (HER) is of paramount importance for improving the generation of   $\\mathsf{H}_{2}$   fuel  by electro catalytic water-splitting. This study puts forward a new N-aniondecorated   $\\mathsf{N i}_{3}\\mathsf{S}_{2}$   material synthesized by a simple one-step calcination route,  acting as a superior bi functional electro catalyst for the OER/HER for the first  time. The introduction of N anions significantly modifies the morphology  and electronic structure of  $\\mathsf{N i}_{3}\\mathsf{S}_{2},$   bringing high surface active sites exposure,  enhanced electrical conductivity, optimal HER Gibbs free-energy   $\\{\\Delta\\mathsf{G}_{\\mathsf{H}^{\\ast}}\\}$  , and  water adsorption energy change   $\\left(\\Delta\\mathsf{G}_{\\mathsf{H}20^{\\ast}}\\right)$  . Remarkably, the obtained   $\\mathsf{N}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{N i}_{3}\\mathsf{S}_{2}/$  NF 3D electrode exhibits extremely low over potentials of 330 and  $110\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu\\textnu}$   to  reach a current density of 100 and   $10\\;{\\sf m A}\\;{\\sf c m}^{-2}$   for the OER and HER in  $1.0\\,\\mathrm{\\,M\\Omega}$    KOH, respectively. Moreover, an overall water-splitting device comprising this  electrode delivers a current density of   $10\\;{\\sf m A}\\;{\\sf c m}^{-2}$   at a very low cell voltage  of 1.48 V. Our finding introduces a new way to design advanced bi functional  catalysts for water splitting.  \n\nOver past few years, a lot of research  efforts have been devoted to developing  non-noble  bi functional  electro catalysts  with outstanding catalytic activities for  HER/OER process, such as carbon materials,   per ovsk ites,   transition-metal  sulfide,   oxides,   nitrides,   phosphides,  and so on. Among these catalysts, the Ni-based compounds, especially  for the nickel sulfide   $(\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2})$   material, has  been regarded as a promising water-splitting electro catalyst due to the high conductivity and unique 3D configuration.  \n\nThe rapid consumption of fossil fuels has caused serious  energy shortage and environmental problems which forced us  to have a further research on green renewable energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water-splitting devices,  rechargeable metal–air batteries, and regenerative fuel cells.   Among various energy conversion systems, the water-splitting devices, which were driven by electro catalytic hydrogen  evolution reaction (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER)  as cathodic and anodic electrode reaction, playing important  roles in hydrogen energy supply.  So far, the major obstacles  restricted the widely commercial application of water-splitting  devices are lack of high-active and low-cost electro catalysts  with low over potential requirement for both HER and OER  \n\nHowever, the further improvement of electro catalytic activity  for   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   material has still been largely limited due to the low  surface active exposure and less competitive stability.  In this  regard, a number of strategies, such as regulating specific morphologies,  exposing high-index facets,  and optimizing  chemical compositions  etc., have been developed to address  these challenges. Among them, regulating the composition  of   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   by heteroatom doping has been regard as a universal  route to improve its catalytic activity, such as the introduction transition-metal ions can extremely enhance the free car- rier density  as well as increase the active sites resulting in  much improved catalytic activities for   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   materials.  However, the introduction of transition-metal atoms into the   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$    tends to bring the complication of metal-active sites, resulting  in significant influence on the investigation of intrinsic catalytic activity.  Recently, despite a great number of researches  on transition-metal doping have been reported, there is little  research on modifying the catalytic activity of   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$  material  by hetero-anion atoms up to date. As an efficient modified  strategy, surface anions decoration would also have the capability for regulating electronic structure with little influence on  the crystal structure and catalytic active sites, more benefits is  in favor of optimizing the adsorption energy of reactive species  to greatly increase the electro catalytic activity. In this regard,  anion regulation would be a promising strategy to modify electronic structure and catalytic activity of electro catalysts both for  OER/HER.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/9eb96a443cb07b6bedb95ec5f30f7330345c2d4e00408fcfe6df21ceb970c2a4-1727114857.jpg)  \n\nHerein, we developed a novel nitrogen-anion decorated   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   material   $(\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2})$   directly grown on nickel foam substrate by a simple one-step solid reaction, representing as a  high-active bi functional HER/OER electro catalyst for the first  time. Benefiting from the high exposed active surface areas,  enhanced charge transfer capacity and better adsorption  energy, the obtained nitrogen-anion decorated   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   3D electrode   $\\mathrm{(N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F)}$   exhibited excellent electro catalytic activity  towards both OER and HER under alkaline conditions. Notably,  integrating this electro catalyst into an alkaline electro l yz er  shows a low potential requirement and high stability, which is  superior to most of the state-of-the-art Ni-based electrode materials. In conclusion, anion-atom decoration paves a new way to  optimize the electro catalytic activity for energy conversion and  storage systems.  \n\nIn our case, the synthetic strategy of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   3D electrode is illustrated in  Figure   1 . Specifically, bare Ni foam was  first treated with acid to remove the metal oxides on the surface  and directly used as the growth substrate. And then, the thiourea powder was used as both sulfur and nitrogen sources to  synthesize   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   by a simple one-step annealing reaction.  As shown in Figure 1a; and Figure S3a (Supporting Information), the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   samples were uniformly coated  on the Ni foam substrate, indicating that the surface of Ni foam  has been transformed into   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   successfully. Moreover, the  loose and porous morphology of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   product can be attributed to the low reactant concentration of N, S sources from the  slow decomposition of thiourea powder. As a contrast, the SEM  image of pristine   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   material exhibits the bulk morphology that may be ascribed to the higher reactant concentration of S by using the sulfur powder as reactant (Figure 1b; and  Figure S4b, Supporting Information). Moreover, the detailed  structural and phase information has been evaluated by the  X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). As shown in  Figure   2 a, all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to hexagonal   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   (JCPDS  44-1418) and Ni foam substrate (JCPDS 04-0850) and without  any additional diffraction peaks of other impurities, indicating  the high quality of as-obtained   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
