CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It should be worth noting that the capability of more exciton harvesting and fast exciton separation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}\\,\\mathrm{QCs}$   can potentially induce the facile coupled electronic  and photonic memory devices. Figure 3b shows the resp on siv it y  of photonic RRAM with respect to incident light irradiance in  which the device is under the illumination with a wavelength  of   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . During the SET process, turn-on voltage steadily  decreases from 2.6, 2.3, 1.7, 1.4 to   $1.1\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , while the on-current  of devices varies from   $2.32\\,\\times\\,10^{-5}$  ,   $5.68\\times10^{-5}$  ,   $4.92\\,\\times\\,10^{-5}$  ,   $5.29\\times10^{-5}$   to  $4.58\\times10^{-5}$   A with the increased illumination intensities from 0, 0.041, 0.069, 0.129 to  $0.153\\;\\mathrm{mW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The obvious  decrease in SET/RESET voltages and increase in HRS currents  are obtained with the increased irradiance. It can be seen that  the current density of the device in HRS state could be converted  from  $10^{-5}$   to   $10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at  $0.5~\\mathrm{V}$   (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

Except the negligible sensitivity to   $620\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   light,  the results confirm detective spectral response of the device  ranging from 365 to   $520\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . The photo response of device in  HRS state is shown in Figure 3c. The off-current increases to   ${\\approx}10^{-10}$   A under light exposure, while decays to   $10^{-12}$   A immediately when the light is turned off. Retention ability of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    QD-based photonic RRAM under dark condition and light illumination is shown in Figure 3d and Figure 3g, respectively. The  ON/OFF current ratio can be well maintained for more than   $4\\times$   $10^{5}$   s under dark condition and light illumination.  \n\nAnalysis of distribution of ON/OFF currents and switching  voltages are presented to address the reproducibility issue  by measuring   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based photonic RRAM with and  without light illumination. Figure 3e and Figure 3h show  the statistical current distribution of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD-based  photonic RRAM under dark condition and light illumination,  respectively. The average current values for ON and OFF states  are measured to be   $1.4\\times10^{-5}$   and   $2.9\\times10^{-10}$   A under dark condition, while the values for the light illumination are measured  to be   $4.5\\times10^{-5}$   and   $5.6\\times10^{-10}$   A. For both the dark and lightillumination testing conditions, the variation of the on current  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/443fe9780403014991f959dcc8940e3e6eb0fc2315d166a49b58baf4830d592d-1727117102.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   a) Schematic illustration of the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QD-based logic OR device. b) The typical  I–V  characteristics of the ITO/PMMA/CsPbBr 3 /PMMA/Ag  structured device measured in the dark or under a UV lamp (light wavelength:  $365\\:\\mathsf{n m}$  ) with irradiance varies from 0.041, 0.069, 0.129 to  $0.153\\:\\mathsf{m W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  .  c) The photo response curve of the RRAM device at HRS, measured at   $0.5~\\mathrm{V}$   with UV light pulse stimulation (light wavelength:   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$  , light  intensity:  $0.153\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{-2})$  ). d) Retention performance with and without light illumination. e) Statistical distribution of the on current and off current for  100 samples in four substrates in the dark condition. f) Histogram of the SET and RESET voltage for 100 samples in the dark condition. g) Endurance  test results with and without light illumination. h) Statistical distribution of the on current and off current for 100 samples under light illumination.  i) Histogram of the SET and RESET voltage for 100 samples under light illumination.  \n\n(without light:   $35\\%$  ; with light illumination:   $26\\%$  ) is much  smaller than the off current (without light:   $210\\%$  ; with light  illumination:   $158\\%$  ) Additionally, the distribution of the SET  and RESET voltages with and without irradiance is compared  in Figure 3f and Figure 3i. The average SET voltage is shifted  from   $2.6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   (without light) to   $1.0\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   (with light illumination),  while the corresponding RESET voltage is drifted from   $-2.7$  to   $-1.8\\ \\mathrm{V}.$   These data reveal a great control over consistency of  cycle to cycle and device to device, which is the main concern  for the state-of-the-art electronic data storage device.  \n\nConsequently, light and electric field, as the input signals, can  effectively change the resisitive states of the device.  In the logic  operation exhibited in Figure 3a (inputs A and B are the light and  electric field, and output C is the detective current level), we define  the light on state and the light off state as the signal   $^{\\alpha}1^{\\flat}$   and “  $\"0\"$    for input A, the positive electric field and negative electric electrical  field as the signal “1” and   $\"0\"$   for input B, high current level and  low current level as the signal   $\"1\"$   and   $\"0\"$   for output C. The output  C would be   $\"0\"$   only if both of the inputs are   $^{u}0$  .” Otherwise, the  output would always be “1”. This logic operations implemented  our RRAM device can be applied as an   $\\leftrightsquigarrow$   logic gate.  \n\nTo explore the underlying resistive switching mechanism,  experimental studies have been carried out to verify synergies  of electrochemical metal liz ation and valance change in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    QD-based RRAM.  I–V  characteristics of RRAM devices fabricated with inert top electrode materials—gold (Au)—in comparison with Ag electrode are shown in  Figure   4 a. It is clear that  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  -based RRAM with different top electrode materials exhibits typical resistive switching effect. However, the  SET voltage of the ITO/PMMA/CsPbBr 3 /PMMA/Ag structured  memory device is   $2.4~\\mathrm{V},$   which is smaller when compared with  SET voltage of the Au-top-electrode-based RRAM (4.5 V).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/cae0524460728accf29a64c70130fd4d856c2fb58d029dc2db36adaa4aa5c703-1727117036.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
