Introduction  \n\nHigh-entropy (HE) oxides have become increasingly popular as electromagnetic wave-absorbing materials owing to their customizable structure  and unique HE effects. However, the weak loss property of single-phase  HE ceramics and the approaches implemented to improve them based on  semi-empirical rules severely limit their development. Herein, two biphasic  HE oxides are prepared by simple sintering to realize accurate regulation of crystal phases and structural defects. It is verified that HE effects  cause various defects that are beneficial for microwave dissipation within  complex-phase ceramics. In spinel/perovskite HE oxides, around the  interface of spinel (111) and perovskite (110) planes, notable stress concentrations and lattice distortions are directly observed, inducing numerous  point defects and stacking faults. Interestingly, besides the existing heterogeneous interface of rock salt (220)/spinel (220) plane and defects, rock  salt/spinel HE oxides enabled synergistic effects via the precise regulation  of components’ phase. Driven by structural defects and multi-phases in  HE complexes, the intense polarization is evidently found, confirmed by  the first-principles calculations. Accordingly, the two complex-phase HE  oxides demonstrate excellent microwave absorption performance, and  the minimal reflection loss of  − 54.5 dB is achieved. Therefore, this study  provides valuable guidelines for the design of microwave absorbers using  HE oxides.  \n\nOwing to the rapid development of electronic information technologies, electromagnetic (EM) interference significantly  impacts our daily lives, and effective EM  wave absorption materials have been  developed to address these issues.  The  performance of absorbing materials significantly depends on their composition  and structural defects.  Nonetheless, it  remains challenging to accurate characterize and regulate the composition and  structural defects of absorbing materials.  \n\nRecently,  high-entropy  (HE)  oxides,  i.e., those composed of five or more metal  cations in equimolar or near-isomolar  concentrations, have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their unique  HE effects. The three main properties that  affect the performance of absorbers (dielectric, electrical, and magnetic) can be tuned  and optimized under the “cocktail” effect,  thus, HE oxides have proved to be a promising absorbing material.  It is well known  that the abundance of defective sites within  absorbers is a key contributor to EM wave  loss.  In HE oxides, the mismatch between  \n\nthe ion mass, size, and bonding state results in significant stress  concentrations and lattice distortions,  which produce a range  of structural defects that favor EM wave loss. For instance, in HE  spinel phases, the different bonding states between various metal  ions and oxygen atoms create a disordered electronic environment  around the oxygen atoms. Thus, it will prompt the detachment of  these ions to form defects, as the disordered metal cations at sites  A and B exhibit multi valence.  Furthermore, unlike HE alloys,  which are entirely composed of metal atoms occupying a single  point,   the sub lattices in HE oxides composed of different anions  and cations have greater structural tunability, which enables the  semi-quantitative or even quantitative characterization of defects.  \n\nRost et al.  reported the first HE oxide with a rock salt phase  in 2015, which has led to the research of various crystalline  phases (such as spinel   and perovskite  ). Several experiment  studies have demonstrated that single-phase HE ceramics, with  their excellent entropy-stabilized and semiconductor properties, can be effectively applied in the fields of energy storage,    catalysis,  thermo electricity,  and wear-resistant coatings.   However, the poor inter facial polarization of single-phase ceramics  significantly affects the wave-absorbing capability of HE oxides.  For instance, the HE spinel   $\\mathrm{(Mg_{0.2}M n_{0.2}F e_{0.2}C o_{0.2}N i_{0.2})F e_{2}O_{4}}$  was prepared through solid state synthesis, and its minimum  reflection loss   $.R L_{\\mathrm{min}})$   was  $-35.10\\,\\mathrm{dB}$   at  $6.78\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$   with a thickness  of   $3.5\\;\\mathrm{mm}$  .   The   $R L_{\\mathrm{min}}$   value of HE   $(\\mathrm{Ti}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Zr}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Hf}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Nb}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Ta}_{0.2})\\mathrm{C}$    was  $-38.5$   dB at   $9.5\\:\\mathrm{GHz}$   and the effective absorption bandwidth  ( E AB, RL below − 10 dB) was  $2.3\\:\\mathrm{GHz}$   (from 11.3 to   $13.6\\:\\mathrm{GHz}$  ).   The above fore mentioned singe-phase ceramic presented  the limited EM wave absorption properties. By enriching the  heterogeneous interfaces within ceramics by introducing a  second phase, a broader platform can be provided for tuning  the properties of absorbing materials.  A novel HE rare  earth silicide carbides/oxides   $\\mathrm{(Im_{0.2}Y_{0.2}P r_{0.2}G d_{0.2}D y_{0.2})_{3}S i_{2}C_{2}/}$   $\\mathrm{(Tm_{0.2}Y_{0.2}P r_{0.2}G d_{0.2}D y_{0.2})_{2}O_{3}}$   showed an  $R L_{\\mathrm{min}}$   value of  $-40.7$   dB  and EAB achieved   $3.4~\\mathrm{GHz}$   with a thickness of   $2.9\\ \\mathrm{mm}$  .  It  was reported that the coexistence of spinel-type and corundumtype phases in HE oxide   $(\\mathrm{Fe}_{x}\\mathrm{CoNiCrMn})_{m}\\mathrm{O}_{n}$   presented the  enhanced EM wave absorption properties in comparison with  single-phase HE oxides.  Dai et  al. used an in situ reductive strategy to constructed a heterogeneous phase in HE   $(\\mathrm{Fe_{0.2x}\\mathrm{Co_{0.2}\\mathrm{Ni_{0.2}\\mathrm{Cr_{0.2}\\mathrm{Mn_{0.2})_{3}\\mathrm{O_{4},}}}}}}$   to form a dual-phase composite.    The composites can achieve substantial absorption almost  across the whole X band. However, the exploration of complexphase HE oxides is still in the early stage, and the preparation of complex-phase HE absorbers with stable entropy while  ensuring the quantitative regulation of the ratio of each crystalline phase remains a challenging task.  \n\nIn this study, we designed and implemented complex phase HE  oxides with tunable phase ratios for microwave absorption. Three  extensively studied single-phase HE oxides were used to develop  spinel/perovskite and rock salt/spinel complex-phase ceramics  by adding an excess of Cr and Fe. This design of complex-phase  HE absorbers has several notable advantages. First, the introduction of the second phase resulted in a rich heterogeneous inter- face, which significantly enhanced the inter facial polarization of  absorbers; second, the lattice distortion caused by HE effects created numerous defect sites within complex-phase ceramics that are  conducive to microwave loss (for example, numerous point defects  and stacking faults were observed near the spinel (111)/perovskite  (110) and rock salt (220)/spinel (220) interfaces); third, the phase  composition and structural defects can be quantitatively controlled  by adjusting the biphasic ratio, thus enabling the regulation of the  forbidden band width and dielectric constant of the system. Moreover, first-principles calculations demonstrated that the regulation  of defects and phases can effectively improve the polarization properties of HE complexes. Hence, by utilizing the synergistic effect  of heterogeneous surfaces and defects as well as the tunability  of impedance matching, the proposed complex-phase HE oxide  absorbers exhibited exceptional absorption performance in the  X-band   $(8.2{\\cdot}12.4\\,\\mathrm{GHz})$  ). Accordingly, the results of this study can act  as guidelines for the design of efficient microwave absorbers for  HE oxides as well as their components and defect modulation.  \n\n# 2.
