CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Finally, the devices  were completed by depositing   $80\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   of gold electrodes using thermal  evaporation.  \n\nCharacterizations and Measurements : XRD data were obtained from  a Bruker Advanced X-ray diffract o meter (  $.40~\\mathrm{kV}$   and   $30~\\mathsf{m A},$  ) with  $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K o}$  radiation. UV–vis absorption spectra of deposited films were measured  by a spectrophotometer (V-650, Jasco). The functional groups of the  films were characterized by an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet 5700  FTIR) with an ATR accessory. The chemical composition of films was  measured by XPS (Kratos Ultra) with Al   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  radiation source, and all the  binding energies were calibrated by using C 1s   $(284.8\\,\\mathsf{e V})$   as a reference.  The surface and cross-section morphology of deposited films were  recorded using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM,  JEOL 7001).
