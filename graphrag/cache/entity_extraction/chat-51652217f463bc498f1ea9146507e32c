Experimental Section  \n\nRaw Materials :  N , N -Dimethyl form amide (DMF),  $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$  , CsBr, acetone,  oleic acid (OA), oil amine (OAm) were purchased from Aladdin. PVDF  was purchased from ANOW Micro filtration Co. Ltd. Silver pulp (Ag) and  polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyimide tape were purchased from  Guangzhou Goulin New Material and Suzhou Yingde Electronics Co.  Ltd. Unless otherwise specified, all raw materials were purchased from  commercial suppliers and used as original.  \n\nPreparation of Precursor Solution   $C s P b B r_{3}@P V D F$  :  In situ growth  method :  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}\\emptyset\\mathsf{P V D F}$   homogeneous solution was prepared by in situ  growth method (also known as one-step method). In detail, 0.20 mmol  of CsBr and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   were added to  $\\mathsf{10~m L}$   DMF and stirred on a magnetic  agitator until completely dissolved to prepare the required precursor  solution. Then  $0.50~\\mathrm{g}$   PVDF was added and stirred magnetically at  $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  until it was completely dissolved into a clear and transparent solution.  Then   $0.30~\\mathrm{mL}$   OA and   $0.03~{\\mathrm{mL}}$   OAm were added and stirred for   $\\rceil\\textsf{h}$   to  obtain a uniform and transparent perovskite precursor solution. Also,  for comparison, the two-step growth method was also adopted to  synthesize   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}\\emptyset\\mathsf{P V D F}$   (see details in Supporting Information).  \n\nFabrication of   $C s P b B r_{3}@P V D F$   Composite Fibers Based PENG :  Electro spinning :   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}\\emptyset\\mathsf{P V D F}$   composite fibers were fabricated by  electro spinning.   $\\mathsf{A g}$  inter digit a ted electrode with gap sizes and finger  width of   $2\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$   was deposited on PET films by the screen printing  method via a custom-designed mask. After printing was completed,  the electrode was dried at   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $\\rceil\\textsf{h}$  . The inter digit a ted electrode as  a collector was fixed to the high-speed roller with a diameter of   $7\\;\\mathsf{c m}$   and  a length of  $30\\,\\mathsf{c m}$   by double-sided tape. Subsequently,  $10\\;\\mathsf{m L}$   of the above  precursor solution was stocked in a syringe with a stainless steel needle  with a diameter of   $0.22\\ \\mathsf{m m}$  . During the process of electro spinning, a  fixed potential of   $15~\\mathrm{kV},$  , a stable velocity of   $0.50\\,\\mathrm{\\mL{L}\\ h^{-1}}$   and a typical  collection distance of   $15\\,\\textsf{c m}$   and rotating speed of   $3000\\,\\mathrm{~r~}\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$   were  setup. The electro spun fibers were then dried in a conventional oven at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $2~\\mathsf{h}$  .  \n\nFabrication of the PENG : After the lead was drawn from the two ends  of the inter digit a ted electrode, polymethyl meth a cry late (PMMA) was  spin-coated on the side of inter digit a ted electrode covered composite  fibers. It was filled between the nanowires and a layer of PMMA film  was formed on top of the composite fibers, which could fix the internal  structure and protect the piezoelectric fibers. Then a layer of polyimide  (PI) tape was glued on the PMMA layer. Subsequently, samples were  polarized in an electric field to obtain the PENG.  \n\nCharacterizations and Measurements : The morphology of composite  fibers were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, FEI  ApreoLoVac) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2  F30 S-TWIN). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker  D8 Advance X-ray diffract o meter using   $\\mathsf{C u-K}\\alpha$  radiation,   $40\\;\\mathrm{~kV},$   and   $40\\;\\mathsf{m A}$  . Electrical analysis was accomplished by applying an external force  on the PENG through a linear motor (LinMot) and recorded by a 6514  electrometer (Keithley Instruments). The intrinsic output characteristics  for load matching and energy storage were studied by connecting a  simple circuit of full bridge rectifier to transform alternating signals into  direct ones.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowled\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
