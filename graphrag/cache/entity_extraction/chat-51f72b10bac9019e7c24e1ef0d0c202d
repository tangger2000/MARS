CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The practical doping concentrations of different   $\\mathrm{RE}^{3+}$   ions in  perovskite QDs were confirmed by the inductively coupled  plasma optical emission spectrometry measurements (Table S1,  Supporting Information), with varied molar concentrations of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   (  $71.2{-}7.2\\%)$  ),   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$     $\\mathrm{\\Delta}[0.13\\mathrm{-}1.7\\%]$  ), and   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$     $(2.0–2.5\\%)$  ), which  were about one-order lower than those of starting materials  (Table S2, Supporting Information).  Figure   1 a–d shows the  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    with different   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   doping concentrations. The sizes gradually  decreases from 8.7 to   $6.9\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   induced by the substitution of Br  by Cl element (Figure S1, Supporting Information). As revealed  by TEM, the as-prepared   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$   QDs demonstrate a  cubic morphology with an average size of   $7.7\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 1e).  After doping with   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   with   $7\\%$   molar ratio, the average size  of QDs reduces to about   $6.9\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . Further codoping with   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   $(2\\%)$   or   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$     $(1.7\\%)$   leads the average size of QDs to decrease  to   $6.8\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . This can be attributed to the lattice contraction of  perovskite QDs due to larger   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   (1.33 Å) was substituted by  smaller rare earth ions   $\\mathrm{(Yb^{3+}}$  : 0.86 Å,  $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  :   $0.88\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Ge}^{3+}{:}1.03\\ \\mathring\\mathrm{A})$  .  The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1i) show that all  the QDs have the same cubic phase (PDF#54-0752), and the  patterns gradually shift toward large angle side because of the  introduction of Cl element. For the   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$     $(7.1\\%)$  ,   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   $(0.12\\%)$  codoped,   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$     $(7.1\\%)$  ,   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$     $(1.7\\%)$   codoped,   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$     $(7.1\\%)$  ,   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   $(2\\%)$   codoped   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$  , the patterns have a little shift of \n\n  $0.19^{\\circ}$   toward large angel compared to the undoped QDs.

The  slight decrease of inter planar distance suggests further that  the small contraction happens in the doped sample due to the  smaller  $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions occupied the sites of larger   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   ions.  \n\nFigure   2 a shows the UV–vis absorption (left), visible \n\n (middle), and near-infrared (right) emission spectra of various \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{x}\\mathrm{Br}_{3\\cdot x}$  :   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   QDs. After the introduction of  Cl and Yb elements in the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   host, the UV–vis absorption  peak shifts toward blue due to the gradually increased bandgap  from the original   $2.49\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   to   $2.88\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   (Figure S2, Supporting  Information), resulting from the partial substitution of   $\\mathrm{Br}$   by  Cl element. This also leads to the gradual blue shift from 520 to   $450\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and intensity\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
