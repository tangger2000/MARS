CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

We also associate the larger estimated inhomogeneous broadening term   $(\\Gamma_{0})$   of the bottom side with imperfections and serious structural disorder stemming from variations  of local compositions and structures.  These results collectively  show that the multi-scale he te rogen ei ties and imperfections permeate the perovskite film, particularly at the buried interface,  and ultimately result in different op to electronic behaviors on  both sides of a poly crystalline perovskite film.  \n\nIn order to assess whether we can regulate these imperfections and multi-scale he te rogen ei ties of buried interfaces  and link these changes to the device performance, we use the   $n$  -HABr as a post-treatment pass iv ation molecule since the   $n$  -HABr shows the most outstanding capabilities in the efficiency improvements and has a largest cation size in a variety  of the pass iv ation molecules.  In practice, we first spincoated a layer of the   $n$  -HABr on the top of the as-prepared  perovskite film that is processed by regular routes and subsequently monitor the local changes of the lead halides and the  sub-microscale dark regions at the buried interfaces by confocal  PL maps at a different annealing time of   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   ( Figure   4 ). Initially, we see the distribution of both lead halides and the dark  regions, but over the first   $1\\,\\mathrm{{min}}$   of annealing, most of the lead  halides are eliminated while the sub-microscale dark regions  remain stable. After   $10\\ \\mathrm{min}$   of annealing, both the lead-halide  signals and sub-microscale dark regions disappear while both  the PL intensity and spatial homogeneity of the perovskite substantially improves. These improvements are also confirmed in  very spatially uniform and luminescent-enhanced PL mappings  on the bottom side of the lift-off per ovsk ites (Figure   $\\mathrm{{S7f},}$  , Supporting Information).  \n\nTo demonstrate the improvements in the confocal PL mappings at buried interfaces of the passivated films, we show the  variation of the morph o logie s of both sides of a perovskite film  after the ammonium-halide pass iv ation ( Figure    5 a,b). Notably,  the passivated perovskite film exhibits a lead-halide elimination  micro structural reconstruction in comparison to the control film  (Figure 2a,b). Moreover, we also observe similar changes in the  micro structure of the perovskite films treated by a series of other  ammonium-halide molecules (with different molecular sizes)  which are broadly utilized in the best-performing PSCs   (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Upon lead-halide elimination micro structural reconstruction, the ratios of both  [Br]/[Pb] and   $\\mathrm{([I]+[B r])/[P b]}$   on the bottom side increase and are  close to the nominal values as confirmed by XPS (Figure S9a,  Supporting Information), suggesting a reduction of local nonstoic hio metric components. The absence of lead halides in  the passivated perovskite films also results in more uniform  surface-potential mapping by KPFM (Figure S9b, Supporting  Information). These improvements have a positive impact on  enhancing the PLQE value of the passivated film as compared  to the control: the bottom side increasing from   $(1.92\\pm0.55)\\%$    to   $(15.18\\pm0.45)\\%$  , from   $(2.41\\pm0.31)\\%$   to   $(14.95\\pm0.68\\%)$   for the  top side (Figure  5e). Thus, the micro structural reconstruction  through the ammonium-halide pass iv ation plays a key role in  improving op to electronic properties over the entire film.  \n\nTo probe the variation of the crystallographic structures and  to clarify what happens upon micro structural reconstruction,  the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)  technique is used to obtain the crystallographic information of  the perovskite film at different penetration depths. Figure 4c,d  compares 2D GIWAXS patterns for the top and bottom sides  of the ammonium-halide-passivated perovskite film with an  incidence angle of   $0.3^{\\circ}$  , respectively (patterns for the incidence  angles of   $0.1^{\\circ}$   and   $0.5^{\\circ}$   and the GIWAXS information of control  sample are provided in Figure S10a,b, Supporting Information).  The integrated signals of the reflections located at   ${\\approx}0.39$  ,  ${\\approx}0.46$  ,  and  $\\mathrm{\\approx}0.6\\mathrm{\\bar{7}}\\;\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$   in Figure 4f at different incidence angles on both  sides of the film are used to track the ammonium-halide–perovskite complex and confirm its permeation through the film. With increasing penetration depth from the bottom side, the  reflections at  ${\\approx}0.46$   and  $\\approx\\!0.67\\ \\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}^{-1}$   gradually increase, while that  at   $\\approx\\!0.39\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}^{-1}$   decreases. It suggests that the preferential orientation of the ammonium-halide–perovskite complex varies  remarkably at the bottom side, due more likely to the physical  constraint at the interface of the perovskite/bottom contact  layer. In addition, a series of enhanced signals at   $\\approx\\!0.58\\ \\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}^{-1}$  of  per ovsk ites (as shown in Figure S10b, Supporting Information)  at the bottom side could be associated with the ammoniumhalide-induced reconstructions of per ovsk ites. We further  investigate the quality of the bottom side through the microstrain. Based on the Williamson–Hall analysis of the integrated  GIWAXS signals, the estimated micro strain near the bottom  side of the ammonium-halide-passivated films decreases from   $(1.39\\,\\pm\\,0.02)\\%$   for the control to   $(1.17\\,\\pm\\,0.04)\\%$   (Figure    $5\\mathrm{g}.$  ,  and see Note S5, Supporting Information, for details). This  reduced micro strain and overall improved properties for the  ammonium-halide-passivated samples suggest that, even  though the cation size of the   $n$  -HABr   $(\\approx\\!8.9\\:\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}})$   and other similar  molecules are larger than the FA cation   $(\\approx\\!2.6\\ \\mathring\\mathrm{A})$  , the imperfection of the buried interface can be improved by the molecule- pass iv ation-assisted micro structural reconstruction, in the right  direction to substantial improvements in the entire film quality  (including both top and buried interfaces).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/7004b18c3301059299be54eaaae5d22a8ef6ad574b1168946d182a9cd1088294-1727130695.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   a) The side and top views of the dedicated sample configuration, and the marker for the time-correlated observation. b) The confocal PL  mappings of the focused areas and the gray-value distribution of the white dashed area at the buried interface from 0 to   $10\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$  .

We show that those  imperfections and in homo geni ties arise from a wide variety  of complex phases. The complex phases consist of various  nanoscale lead-halide crystal lites at the buried interface that  are directly related to undesirable non-radiative recombination centers, although empirical device optimization shows  that a small fraction of excess lead-halide in the starting precursor solution benefits the\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
