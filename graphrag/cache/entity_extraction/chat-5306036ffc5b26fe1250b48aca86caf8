Here, molecular design of  additives for dual pass iv ation of both lead and halide defects in per ovsk ites  is reported. A bi-functional additive, 4-flu oro phenyl methyl ammoniumtri flu oro acetate (FPMATFA), is synthesized by using a simple solution  process. The TFA anions and FPMA cations can bond with under coordinated  lead and halide ions, respectively, resulting in dual pass iv ation of both lead  and halide defects. In addition, the bulky FPMA group can constrain the  grain growth of 3D perovskite, enhancing electron–hole capture rates and  radiative recombination rates. As a result, high-performance PeLEDs with a  peak external quantum efficiency reaching  $\\mathbf{20.9\\%}$   and emission wavelength  at   ${\\bf694\\,n m}$   are achieved using form amid in i um-cesium lead iodide-bromide   $(\\mathsf{F A}_{0.33}\\mathsf{C s}_{0.67}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{I}_{0.7}\\mathsf{B r}_{0.3})_{3})$  . Furthermore, the operational lifetime of PeLEDs is  also greatly improved due to the low trap density in the perovskite film.  \n\nAlthough MHPs are shown to be  very tolerant to defects, both halide  defects (halide dangling bonds caused by  organo ammonium vacancies and halide  interstitial), and lead defects (undercoordinated lead caused by halide vacancies  and lead interstitial) still coexist in solution-processed MHP films,  resulting  in severe non radiative recombination  and instability of PeLEDs. To reduce the  density of halide defects, more thermally  stable long-chain organo ammonium was  used to replace volatile methyl ammonium   $\\mathrm{(CH_{3}N H_{3}^{\\ +}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}})$    or  form a mini diu m   $(\\mathrm{H}C(\\mathrm{NH}_{2})_{2}{}^{+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  ) to suppress genera- tion of organo ammonium vacancies.   Addition of sodium fluoride (NaF) has  also been demonstrated to be an effective method to suppress the formation of  halide defects due to the strong bonding  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nbetween fluorine and FA ions.  To reduce the density of lead  defects, excess halide sources such as methyl ammonium bromide (MABr) or cesium bromide (CsBr) were added into the  stoic hio metric perovskite film to reduce the density of lead  defects.  Small molecules with functional groups such as   $\\mathrm{C=O}$  ,   $\\mathrm{P{=}O}$  , or   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   were also used because they can passivate under coordinated lead directly due to their strong bonding  with lead.  \n\nMetal halide per ovsk ites (MHPs) are emerging as a new type  of semiconducting materials for various electronic and optoelectronic devices such as perovskite solar cells,  lightemitting diodes (LEDs),  photo/X-ray detectors,  and  memristors.  Perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) are particularly  interesting because of their wide color gamut, high color purity,  tunable emission wavelength, etc.  The external quantum  efficiency (EQE) of PeLEDs has been boosted from less than   $1\\%$   to over   $20\\%$   in the past 5 years through trap passivation,  grain size control,  mixing of low-dimensional  \n\nIt should be noted that mixed-halide per ovsk ites need more  sophisticated pass iv ation because the defects also induce halide  segregation which results in pinning of emission wavelength  at IR range from iodide-rich domains.  However, up till  now, the reported additives in PeLEDs can only passivate one  type of defects, either lead or halide defects, while both types  of defects coexist in the film.  Strategies that simultaneously passivate lead and halide defects are still lacking, limiting  the performances and stability of PeLEDs, particularly mixedhalide PeLEDs.  \n\nIn this work, we report molecular design of additives for  dual pass iv ation of both lead and halide defects in MHPs. We  synthesize  4-flu oro phenyl methyl ammonium-tri flu oro acetate  (FPMATFA) by acid–base neutralization reaction. The FPMA  cations can coordinate with halide dangling bonds at the perovskite crystal surface and thus passivate halide defects, while the  TFA anions can bond strongly with lead and thus passivate lead  defects. The dual pass iv ation effect of FPMATFA is also proved  by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, we  boost the EQE of mixed-halide-based PeLEDs to   $20.9\\%$   with an  electroluminescence (EL) peak at   $694~\\mathrm{nm}$  . In addition, the halflifetime   $\\left(T_{50}\\right)$   of PeLEDs device is greatly improved from  $0.25\\;\\mathrm{h}$  without additives to over   $14\\:\\mathrm{{h}}$   with FPMATFA.  \n\n# 2. Results and Discussion  \n\nFigure  1 a shows a schematic of surface defects including  halide defects (negatively charged halide dangling bonds  (organo ammonium vacancy) or I interstitial (I i )) and lead  defects (positively charged under coordinated lead (halide  vacancy) or   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   interstitial   $(\\mathrm{{Pb}_{i})}$  ). These defects have relatively  small formation energy in MHPs.  It should be noted that  both halide and lead defects coexist at the grain surface of solution-processed MHP films.  \n\nIn view of the two types of defects at the surface, we  precisely design and synthesize a dual pass iv ation additive FPMATFA. On one hand, FPMA cations have stronger  hydrogen bonding with halide ions than FA cations due to  the electron withdrawing of F atom so that it can suppress  the formation of halide dangling bonds.  On the other  hand, the lone pair of electrons in TFA anions can bond  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/1c914c7d1dda1f42b53ccb774794a2a960603f092f3768fc3075f4ddbfcb258f-1727100333.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   The dual pass iv ation mechanism of FPMATFA. a) Schematic illustration of defect pass iv ation at perovskite grain boundaries by FPMATFA.
