CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals coated with zirconium oxide, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>Synthesis method<|>Modified method used to obtain CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsBr<|>Reagent<|>Cesium bromide, a source of cesium ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbBr2<|>Reagent<|>Lead bromide, a source of lead ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve CsBr and PbBr2, abbreviated as DMF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OAm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Intermediate product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals formed before ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>Precursor<|>Zirconium butoxide, precursor for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZrO2<|>Coating material<|>Zirconium oxide, used to coat CsPbBr3 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Room temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the synthesis was carried out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.4 mmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of PbBr2 and CsBr used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of DMF used to dissolve PbBr2 and CsBr)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.2 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OAm used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.6 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OA used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1500 rpm<|>Reaction condition<|>Speed of vigorous stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10s<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>60 µmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 used for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8500 rpm<|>Purification condition<|>Speed of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 min<|>Purification condition<|>Duration of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The modified super saturated recrystallization method is used to synthesize CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsBr<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>CsBr is a source of cesium ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbBr2<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>PbBr2 is a source of lead ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CsBr<|>DMF is used to dissolve CsBr<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbBr2<|>DMF is used to dissolve PbBr2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OA acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OAm acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Toluene acts as an antisolvent to induce the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>ZrO2<|>Zr(OC4H9)4 is the precursor for ZrO2 coating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZrO2<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>ZrO2 forms a coating on CsPbBr3 NCs to create CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Room temperature<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs is carried out at room temperature<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm is used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Centrifugation at 8500 rpm is used to purify CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{x}\\mathrm{Br}_{3\\cdot x}$  :   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   QDs. After the introduction of  Cl and Yb elements in the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   host, the UV–vis absorption  peak shifts toward blue due to the gradually increased bandgap  from the original   $2.49\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   to   $2.88\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   (Figure S2, Supporting  Information), resulting from the partial substitution of   $\\mathrm{Br}$   by  Cl element. This also leads to the gradual blue shift from 520 to   $450\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and intensity decrease of the perovskite excitonic emission peak under the excitation of   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  . In the near-infrared  region, a sharp line centered at   $988\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   can be observed for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{x}\\mathrm{Br}_{3\\cdot x}$  :   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   QDs, originating from the   ${^2\\mathrm{F}}_{5/2}{-}{^2\\mathrm{F}}_{7/2}$   transition of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions. Its intensity increases obviously with the  increasing doping concentration of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions. The strong  intrinsic emissions of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   ions excited by the absorption of  perovskite host readily indicates the successful substitution  of   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   by   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  ions, and also suggest an efficient energy  transfer occurs from the host to   ${\\tt Y b}^{3+}$   ions. Figure 2b shows  the UV–vis absorption and photo luminescence (PL) spectra  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$  ,   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Yb}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Yb}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$    and   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Yb}^{3+}$  + ,  $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   QDs. The introduction of RE ions  without changing anions only slightly results in the increase of  the bandgap of   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$   from 2.84 to  $2.88~\\mathrm{eV}$   and the blue  shift of the excitonic emission band from 455 to   $450~\\mathrm{nm}$  . This  is associated with the decrease of lattice cell with the doping  of RE ions, as depicted in Figure 1k. Although the doping of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   induces the suppress of excitonic emission intensity, the  overall intensity of the excitonic emission and the   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   emission increases about two times than the undoped QDs. Further codoping with   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   leads the overall intensity to decrease  slightly. With increasing the concentration of   $\\mathrm{Er^{3+}}$  , the emission  of   ${}^{4}\\mathrm{I}_{13/2}\\mathrm{-}^{4}\\mathrm{I}_{15/2}$   at   $1540~\\mathrm{nm}$   for   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   become more distinct. The  emission of   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   ions at   $1540\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   may be mainly induced by  the energy transfer from   $\\mathrm{{}^{2}F_{7/2}}$   level of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions to   $^{4}\\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$   level  of   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   ions, because no emission of   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   ions was observed at  the infrared region in the   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$  :   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   perovskite QDs  (Figure S3, Supporting Information). It should be noted that in  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}{\\mathrm{:Yb}}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  QDs, efficient up conversion luminescence originating   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   can be also realized under   $980\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    pumping (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The introduction of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   in   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$   results in the blue   $4\\mathrm{f}{-}5\\mathrm{d}$   emis- sions of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   besides the excitonic band and the overall intensity  \n\nTable 1.   PLQY of visible part, near-infrared part, and overall region for  different perovskite QDs. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/e248234b3847b9035ec8c66465354af56fdb35ec490b79e238c7d5648cf6364e-1727115380.jpg)  \n\nincreases about two times than the undoped QDs. In the   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Yb}^{3+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   QDs, the intensity for   $4\\mathrm{f}{-}5\\mathrm{d}$   emissions of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   suppresses in contrast to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{;Ca}^{3+}$  ,  while the emission of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  increases largely. The intensity  increase of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   at   $988\\,\\mathrm{~nm}$   is about twice of the intensity  decrease of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$   around   $488\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , indicating quantum cutting  emission process happens effectively. In order to further determine the happening of quantum cutting process, the inner  luminescent quantum yields of different QDs are measured by  integral spheres, as listed in  Table   1 . As shown, the PLQY for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   is   $69.2\\%$  , the involving of Cl in the lattices results in  the decrease of PLQY to different contents. It is interesting to  observe that with the introduction of   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  , the overall PLQYs  increases largely over the undoped QDs. The PLQYs for  some of the   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$  -doped perovskite QDs even surpass   $100\\%$  .  This indicates that even for the   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   single-doped perovskite  QDs, quantum cutting emission process may also occur. The  codoping of  $\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{e}^{3+}$   accelerates the happening of quantum cutting  emission process, as one of the most famous RE pairs.
