The performance of  these devices is determined sensitively by  the activity of electro-catalysts for several  electrochemical reactions such as oxygen  evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolu- tion reaction (HER).  Low-cost transition  metal oxides have been extensively investigated as promising candidates to replace  currently used noble metal–based materials such as   $\\mathrm{Pt}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{lrO}_{2}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$  .  However, their performance still needs to be  further improved to meet the requirement  for many practical applications.  \n\nDeveloping low-cost, high-performance electro-catalysts is essential for  large-scale application of electrochemical energy devices. In this article,  reported are the findings in understanding and controlling oxygen defects  in   $\\mathsf{P r B a}_{0.5}\\mathsf{S r}_{0.5}\\mathsf{C o}_{1.5}\\mathsf{F e}_{0.5}\\mathsf{O}_{5+\\delta}$  (PBSCF) for significantly enhancing the rate of  oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are reported. Utilizing surface-sensitive  characterization techniques and first-principle calculations, it is found that  excessive oxygen vacancies promote  $\\mathsf{o}\\mathsf{H}^{-}$   affiliation and lower the theoretical  energy for the formation of  $\\circ\\ast$   on the surface, thus greatly facilitating the  OER kinetics. On the other hand, however, oxygen vacancies also increase  the energy band gap and lower the  $\\circ\\,2p$   band center of PBSCF, which may  hinder OER kinetics. Still, careful tuning of these competing effects has  resulted in enhanced OER activity for PBSCF with oxygen defects. This work  also demonstrates that oxygen defects generated by different techniques have  very different characteristics, resulting in different impacts on the activity  of electrodes. In particular, PBSCF nanotubes after electrochemical reduction exhibit outstanding OER activity compared with the recently reported  perovskite-based catalysts.  \n\nCommonly observed in transition metal  oxides, oxygen defects (such as oxygen  vacancies and interstitial s) are found to  critically affect the material properties  such as electronic structure,  ionic/electronic conductivity,  and magnetic properties.  The presence of oxygen defects in  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nthe transition metal oxides can potentially enhance the adsorption of specific reaction intermediates, leading to unconventional chemical activities.  Oxygen defect engineering recently  emerged as a novel way to improve the electro-catalytic activity of  transition metal oxides.  For instance, the OER activity of   ${\\mathrm{Co}}_{3}{\\mathrm{O}}_{4}$    was reported to be significantly improved by introducing abundance of oxygen vacancies using a plasma treatment.  Highly  defective perovskite   $\\mathrm{Ca_{2}M n_{2}O_{5}}$   exhibited very high OER activity,  attributed to the facilitated OER on the oxygen-deficient sites.   Mefford et al.  showed that the increase of Sr dopants in   $\\mathrm{La}_{1-x}$   $\\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\\mathrm{CoO}_{3-\\delta}$  led to higher oxygen deficiency, greater covalency of  the   $\\mathrm{Co-O}$   bond, and better OER activity. Besides OER activity,  the presence of oxygen defects was also reported to enhance the  performance of active materials for   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   reduction reaction  and  nitrogen reduction reaction.  Despite these successful examples,  some negative effects of excessive oxygen vacancies were also  reported in the literature. The OER activities of   $\\mathrm{La}_{0.6}\\mathrm{Ca}_{0.4}\\mathrm{Co}\\mathrm{O}_{3-\\delta}^{[12]}$     and  $\\mathrm{La}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.3}\\mathrm{CoO}_{3-\\delta}{}^{[13]}$   were found to be decreased after thermal  annealing in a reducing atmosphere.   $\\mathrm{FeCoO}_{x}{}^{[14]}$   showed the  highest OER performance with optimal oxygen vacancy density of   $34\\%$   after annealing at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  in   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   of   $2.0\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$  . Further  increase in concentration of oxygen vacancies led to a decrease  in OER activity. For rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts via oxygen defect engineering, it is necessary to understand how oxygen defects influence the electro-catalytic activity,  \n\nOwing to the high efficiency and environmental friendliness,  electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, such as  \n\nand to develop approaches that can introduce oxygen defects in a  controlled manner.  \n\nIn this work, we used a   $\\mathrm{Pr}\\mathrm{Ba}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Co}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Fe}_{0.5}\\mathrm{O}_{5+\\delta}$  (PBSCF)  thin film, prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), as the  model system to reveal systemic ally how oxygen vacancies  impact the OER activity, as confirmed by the combination of  experimental measurements and first-principle calculations.  PBSCF was selected as the model material because of its good  electro-catalytic activity and the capability to accommodate a  large amount of oxygen vacancies without changing the crystal  structure.  The use of thin film model system with welldefined structure can avoid the complication arising from the  changes in micro structure, which are often observed in porous  oxide catalysts.  Electrochemical measurement showed  that the OER performance of the PBSCF thin films was noticeably improved after introducing oxygen vacancies via thermal  annealing in a   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   atmosphere and electrochemical reduction.  The combination of first-principle calculations and surfacesensitive characterization techniques, such as scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), has helped us to gain more insight  into the impact of oxygen vacancy on the intrinsic OER activity  of PBSCF electrodes. Excessive oxygen vacancies in PBSCF,  on the one hand, led to larger band gap and lower O   $2p$   band  center, which are detrimental for the OER performance. These  defects, on the other hand, resulted in better   $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$   affiliation  and the lower theoretical energy to form   $\\mathrm{O^{*}}$  , which is considered to be the rate-limiting step of OER on PBSCF. The facilitated surface adsorption and reaction kinetics eventually led to  the overall enhanced OER performance of PBSCF thin films.  \n\nOur work has also demonstrated that oxygen defects generated by different techniques have very different character istics, resulting in different impact on the activity of electrodes.  We compared the impacts of thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction on OER activity of PBSCF powders and  nanotubes (NTs). Thermal annealing is the most widely used  approach to engineer the oxygen defects in transition metal  oxides, which have been demonstrated to significantly enhance  the OER activity of several oxides, such as  ${\\mathrm{CaMNO}}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathrm{{MnO}_{2}}.$  , and   $\\mathrm{Fe_{1}C o_{1}O_{x}}$  .  Electrochemical reduction was less used for  generating oxygen vacancies, but was reported to have advantages of high efficiency and easy operations.  Our results  showed that oxygen defects generated by these two treatments  distributed differently in the PBSCF samples. Oxygen vacancies  introduced by thermal annealing distributed across the whole  bulk of PBSCF, while the defects generated by electrochemical  reduction mainly located in the surface region. As a result,  electrochemical reduction was capable to introduce higher  density of oxygen vacancies on the surface while maintain the  bulk crystal structure. We further found that thermal annealing  could cause the aggregation of nano structures, leading to the  collapse of the hollow structure of the NTs. Such change in  micro structure resulted in a decreased specific surface area  for the annealed PBSCF NTs, thus leading to degraded OER  activity. However, the electrochemical reduction did not alter the  nano structure of PBSCF NTs, and the NTs after electrochemical  reduction demonstrated enhanced OER activity with an overpotential of   $313\\ \\mathrm{\\mV}$   (versus reversible hydrogen electrode  (vs RHE)) at   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (current normalized to the geometric  area of the electrode) and a Tafel slope of   $58\\,\\mathrm{\\mV\\\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
