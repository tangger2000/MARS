The power conversion  efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells  (PSCs) skyrockets from   $3.8\\%$   to   $24.2\\%$    within a few years.  However, the instability of PSCs remains as the largest  hurdle for their commercialization. Many  efforts are witnessed to improve the materials resistance to moisture, oxygen, and  thermal/electric stress, without serious  penalty to the device efficiency.  To further achieve both efficiency and lifetime in  devices to meet the requirements for practical use, it requires additional toolboxes  from different perspectives.  \n\nTo improve the photovoltaic performance (both efficiency and stability)  in hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells, perovskite lattice distortion is investigated with regards to residual stress (and strain)  in the poly crystalline thin films. It is revealed that residual stress is  concentrated at the surface of the as-prepared film, and an efficient  method is further developed to release this inter facial stress by A site  cation alloying. This results in lattice reconstruction at the surface of  poly crystalline thin films, which in turn results in low elastic modulus.  Thus, a “bone-joint” configuration is constructed within the interface  between the absorber and the carrier transport layer, which improves device  performance substantially. The resultant photovoltaic devices exhibit an  efficiency of  $\\pmb{21.48\\%}$   with good humidity stability and improved resistance  against thermal cycling.  \n\nResidual  stresses  are  commonly  observed in thin films of semiconductors, which may be originated from thermal stress, and external conditions during grain  coalescence/growth.  Residual stresses provide a clear measure  of lattice distortion in the macroscopic viewpoint, which reflects  the inter atomic bonding in the long periodic range that governs  the materials properties. By tuning the residual stress within the  film, the ph y sio chemical properties of the materials can be effectively tailored, which further affects the corresponding device  performance and stability consequently.  As a set to conventional parameters used in various materials systems, however,  residual stress is lack of systematic investigation in perovskite  materials and corresponding op to electronic devices.  \n\nOnly recently, by temperature-induced stress relaxation in   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   single crystal devices, Mohammed and co-workers  demonstrated a significant enhancement in the carrier mobility,  photo current, charge carrier lifetime, and solar cell performance.  Subsequently, Huang and co-workers  and Dauskardt  and co-workers  revealed that the intrinsic instability of  per ovsk ites was stemmed from the residual strain induced by  thermal annealing, wherein the tension strain accelerates the  degradation. Additionally, McGehee and co-workers  compared the stress evolution in perovskite film prepared by onestep and two-step method at different temperature. Berger and  co-workers  and Zhang et  al.  explored strain tuning and  their effects on electronic structure and photovoltaic property  of perovskite materials based on first principles theory calculations, suggesting that strain modulation is an efficient and  relatively easy realization to modulate PSCs performance. Very  recently, our group reported the strain engineering effect on carrier dynamics and enhanced the PCE up to   $20.7\\%$   (certified). In view of recent advances, thermal modulators are often utilized to tune the residual strain of perovskite films. In addition, external light effect on the perovskite strain was studied  by Nie and co-workers, and they elaborated that light triggers  the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lower the energetic  barriers at the per ovsk ites-contact interfaces.  However, the  light-induced local strain relaxation in thin films can recover  when it is stored in dark. It is necessary to develop applicable  methods to tune the stress/strain of hybrid halide perovskite  films, which can be reserved for long.  \n\nRecently, compositional alloying has shown potential to  serve as an alternative strategy to modulate the strain of perovskite. Guan id in i um (GA) salts were employed to improve  the device efficiency,  wherein the GA cation was found to  be well distributed across the perovskite layer to reduce the  micro strain in the films. Snaith and co-workers introduced   $n$  -but yl ammonium (BA) into   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.83}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.17}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{\\gamma}\\mathrm{Br}_{1-\\gamma})_{3}$   perovskite  to achieve both efficiency and stability improvement. They  observed the decrease of lattice constant, which was ascribed  to the probability of released strain.  Kim et al. reported the  MACl addition could induce the intermediate phase with pure   $\\alpha$  phase without annealing, and achieved a certified efficiency  of   $23.48\\%$  .  Lager cations ph en ethyl ammonium   $\\left(\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}\\right)$  , octylammonium   $\\mathrm{(OA^{+})}$   also were investigated.  Ho-Baillie and coworkers reported the pass iv ation effect of grain boundaries by  introducing ph en ethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI) into 3D bulk  per ovsk ites.  Yang and co-workers incorporated   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$   2D  perovskite to stabilize phase-pure form amid in i um perovskite  solar cells. The 2D perovskite spontaneously forms at grain  boundaries to protect the form amid in i um perovskite from  moisture and suppress ion migration.  Ming-Hsien et  al.  elaborated that   $\\mathrm{PEA^{+}}$   intercalated perovskite could modify  perovskite grain size and surface potential by controlling the  doping levels of   $\\mathrm{PEAI/PbI}_{2}$   using a low-pressure vapor-assisted  solution process.  Docampo and co-workers reported the  layered 2D perovskite on top of 3D with improved moisture  stability.  Alharbi et al. revealed the surface pass iv ation with  different types of ammonium salts (ethyl ammonium, imidazolium, and guan id in i um iodide) could reduce the level of electronic defects present at the interface between the perovskite  film and the hole transport layer and boosts the power conversion efficiency.  You and co-workers reported a certified   $23.32\\%$   PCE with PEAI surface pass iv ation.  In view of recent  progress, 2D perovskite mainly passivate the 3D pero kv sites to  improve its carrier lifetime. What else beyond the pass iv ation  effect after large cations incorporation that influence the perovskite film and device performance is not carefully considered.  In this regard, the stress evolution in the perovskite thin films  is rarely explored, and the underlying mechanism governs  residual strain relaxation is worth further investigation in a different perspective.  \n\nHerein, we studied the residual stress relaxation in the  perovskite thin films via A site incorporation. A post treatment  process via lattice reconstruction on   $(\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3})_{0.85}(\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3})_{0.15}$  per ovsk ites films was applied to modulate residual stress distribution across film thickness direction. And the underlying  mechanisms that govern the relaxation of inter facial residual  stress are discussed in detail. The PCE of the resultant device is  enhanced from   $20.02\\%$   up to   $21.48\\%$  , and remarkable longterm stability is achieved to observe only slightly decline  exceeding   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$   under ambient exposure without encapsula- tion. Moreover, we find A site alloying at the surface lattice of  perovskite thin film lead to the inter facial configuration mimic  to the “bone-joint,” which provides a cushioning effect on  external stresses during thermal cycling tests.  \n\nThe perovskite films were fabricated from the precursor with  the composition of   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.15}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.15})_{3}$   in a solvent mixture of   $N,N$  -dimethyl form amide (DMF) and dimethyl s ulf oxide  (DMSO).
