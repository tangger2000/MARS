CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

Moreover, the long-time thermal  stability is necessary. Second, for the four emerging thermoresponsive reviewed, further research could be explored such as  the structure modification to enhance thermo chromic properties, which has been much more extensively investigated in  the   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   system. Third, the hybridization between different  categories of thermo responsive materials have been proved  successful to further enhance the performance, hence more  efforts can be devoted to this direction. Finally, the switch  time should be considered for the thermo responsive material in smart window application. Though there is not a consensus reached, a switch time within several minutes should be  acceptable for energy-saving architecture window, considering  the relatively slow process of temperature fluctuation in a day.  Faster switch property is definitely preferred. Although several  \n\nTable 1.   Summary of achievements and remaining challenges by categories (note: “–” means data not available). \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/b4a0de637ab29459e47498052717126005995ee036e91e86801cc1ac58d6a4c4-1727077912.jpg)  \n\nmaterials were reported with the acceptable switch time, such  as  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  , PNIPAm hydrogel, and liquid crystals, the switch time  has drawn much less attention than the solar modulation or  the switch temperature. Hence, we encourage to consider the  switch time as one of the parameters for new thermo responsive  materials in future development.  \n\nAs for integrated techniques, one direction for further exploration is the combination of active control techniques with  thermo responsive smart windows, which have hitherto been  primarily considered as passive devices, controlled by temperature solely. For example, the electro thermal approach adds extra  control to cost-effective temperature-responsive smart windows,  competing with other commercially available costly electrochromic devices. However in contrast with one-time switch in  electro chromic devices, electro thermal smart window needs  constant heating to remain switched which is more energy consuming. How to cut down the energy consumption is a key to  promote the electro thermal windows. Moreover, it is vital that  integration performance should not be compromised. The integrated layers may affect transmittance and decrease the solar  modulation property. They may also defer the heat transfer,  which could affect the switch time as well as the heat retention  of windows. Additionally, integrated techniques should address  the toxicity and durability issue of the thermo chromic layer  considering the daily human contact with windows and decades service life of architecture windows. And there are likely  to be further, unexplored techniques that could be integrated  with thermo response to produce more efficient, sustainable,  and multi functional energy-efficient smart windows for buildings as well as other applications. Advances in ease of manufacture and cost-effectiveness for both thermo responsive and  integrated techniques are also necessary to bring these technologies from the laboratory to daily life.  \n\nFinally, energy-efficient smart windows hold much promise  for contributing to a future, eco-friendly world. However, there  is still much work needed to make energy-efficient smart windows a practicable solution. It is hoped that this summary will  arouse broader research interests in this field to accelerate  the development of energy-efficient smart windows through  application of suitable materials and integrated techniques,  by both exploring the tremendous existing library of scientific  knowledge and inspiring innovative research for functional  devices within and even beyond energy-efficient smart window  applications.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.K. and C.Z. contributed equally to this work.
