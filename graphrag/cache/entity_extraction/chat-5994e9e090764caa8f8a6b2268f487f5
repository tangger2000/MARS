CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Next, the valence band maxima  (VBM) was determined to be  $-5.57\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   from vacuum level using  photo emission yield spectroscopy in air (PYSA) measurement (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). By combining the  optical bandgap, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the  FAMACs SC was calculated to be at  $-4.04\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{eV}}$   (inset in Figure S3b,  Supporting Information). The VBM and CBM location of the  present SC measured here is important for device design in  selecting proper electron or hole-transporting materials for  solar cells and photodetector s. The elemental composition of  the FAMACs SC was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure S4 and Table S1: Supporting Information) and solid-state   $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$   nuclear magnetic resonance (  $\\mathrm{{}^{1}H}$   NMR)  \n\n(Figure S5, Supporting Information), which is close to that in  the precursor solution (Table S2, Supporting Information). Furthermore, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurement shows that the Cs and Br are incorporated uniformly in  the FAMACs SCs (Figure S6, Supporting Information).  \n\nThe carrier lifetime of the FAMACs SC was measured using  time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) as shown in Figure S7a  (Supporting Information). A two-exponential function was successfully used to fit the carrier lifetime (  $\\dot{\\left(\\tau\\right)}$   in which the short  lifetime originated from the crystal surface carrier recombination is extracted to be  $1.4\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   and the long lifetime from the bulk  crystal is   $6.4\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$  . We note that both the short and long lifetime  of the present FAMACs SC is much longer than its best single  cation SC counterparts like   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   (22 and 1032 ns),  $\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$  (32 and 484  ns),  and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   (132 and 897  ns).

Therefore, an auto PL mapping scan was performed on the crystal surface with a size of   $5.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}\\times5.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$  . As shown in Figure S7b (Supporting Information), the uniform color indicating excellent uniformity over  large area for the high-quality FAMACs SC. We then investigate  the trap state density   $(n_{\\mathrm{trap}})$   and carrier mobility in the FAMACs  SCs by measuring the space charge limited currents (SCLC),  as shown in  Figure   2 a,b, the calculated hole trap density and  electron trap density for FAMACs SCs is   $(4.6\\pm2.4)\\times10^{9}$   and   $(15.2\\pm5.1)\\times10^{9}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  , respectively (Figure 2c). All of them are  among the lowest in perovskite SCs reported so far.  In  addition, we estimated the hole mobility of   $288.4~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}~\\mathrm{V}^{-1}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  and electron mobility of   $268.3\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . We also used timeof-flight (ToF) technique to confirm the high electron mobility  of   $241\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , as shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). Additionally, from the linear ohmic region at low voltages,  we also obtained the conductivity of the FAMACs SC to be   $\\sigma=2.2\\times10^{-8}~(\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm})^{-}$  . Finally, by combining the long carrier  lifetime with the higher measured mobility, we obtained the  best-case carrier diffusion length   $L_{\\mathrm{D}}=(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\mu\\tau/\\mathrm{e})^{1/2}=68.9~\\upmu\\mathrm{m},$  ,  where  $k_{\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
