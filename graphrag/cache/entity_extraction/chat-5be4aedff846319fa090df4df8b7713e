CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

Figure S9 (Supporting Information) shows the element mapping profiles of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   films.  \n\nFigure    3 a illustrates the phase stabilizing mechanism of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite with OTG molecules as the surface capping layer. First, OTG molecules in the precursor solution are  thought to act as nucleation sites for the growth of the cubic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   black phase. This step is followed by formation of a  perovskite film with a surface OTG capping layer. After exposure to moisture or another polar solvent, the bulk alkyl chains  of the OTG molecules provide steric hindrance that suppresses  the tilting of the   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   octahedron frameworks, resulting in  hindrance of the phase transition to the ortho rhombi c phase.  We also performed DFT calculations to better understand the  moisture-induced lattice distortion of cubic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  . We simulated the interaction between   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   molecules and cubic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  containing three-layer   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   octahedral units without and  with OTG1, OTG2, and OTG3 at the lattice surface. The generalized gradient approximation in the form of Perdew–Burke– Ernzerhof was used for the exchange–correlation function. Figure  3b–e shows the geometry-optimized structures. It is  apparent that the surface   $C s^{+}$   ions moved from their original  positions and approached   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   molecules in pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  This change in position induced a shift of the electron cloud  associated with the   $C s^{+}$   ions and thus caused a tilting of the  adjacent corner-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   frameworks. This result is  similar to the prediction of a previous theoretical calculation based on the ethanol molecule.  In contrast, the theo- retical model of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}$  , which contains large bulk alkyl  groups, showed much less lattice distortion, especially in the  case of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$  . The   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}I{-}P b}$   bond angle indicated  in Figure S10 (Supporting Information) is   $134.5^{\\circ}$   in pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  . This angle is much smaller than the angle of the  corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{[PbI_{6}]^{4-}}$   frameworks in the cubic phase   $(180^{\\circ})$  and approaches the angles of the edge-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   frameworks in the ortho rhombi c phase   $(91.4^{\\circ}$   and   $95.1^{\\circ},$  ). Interestingly, this bond angle increases to   $157.8^{\\circ}$  ,   $170.2^{\\circ}$  , and   $179.4^{\\circ}$   in  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}1$  ,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}2$  , and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   models,  respectively. Other calculations illustrate that the decrease of the   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}I{-}P b}$   bond angle gives rise to a weaker antibonding state  with the overlapping   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{I}$   orbitals. This characteristic has been  shown to cause a reduction of the defect tolerance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  perovskite, which is undesirable for high-performance PSCs. This calculated result is consistent with our experimental  results and highlights the importance of regulating   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   lattice distortion to achieve stable and efficient all-inorganic PSCs. To investigate the impact of the organic capping layer on the  \n\nsurface defect states, we used XPS to examine the Pb 4f core  levels of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   ( Figure   4 a). The dominant  peaks (  $7138.0\\;\\mathrm{eV}$   for   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   and   $143.1~\\mathrm{eV}$   for   $4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2})$  ) were associated  with   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   atoms with a saturated coordination, and we attributed the small peaks (asterisks in Figure 4a) at lower binding  energy (  $7136.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   and   $142.0~\\mathrm{eV}$   for   $4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2})$   to the defects  of under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   ions that were associated with the  metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   cluster   $(\\mathrm{Pb}^{0})$  .  Theoretical computations and  experimental studies have indicated that the  $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   defects are the  main source of electronic trap states and serves as a nonradiative recombination center for charge carriers.  By calculating  the peak area ratio of   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   to  $\\operatorname{Pb}4\\mathrm{f},$  , we could estimate the content  of   $\\mathrm{{Pb^{0}}}$   to be   $4.13\\,\\,\\mathrm{{at}\\%}$   and   $0.65{\\mathrm{~at�}}6$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3^{-}}$  OTG3, respectively. This result implies that the organic capping  layer could significantly reduce the density of defects on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   surface. Furthermore, we calculated the electronic trap  density of perovskite film by measuring dark current–voltage \n\n  $(I{-}V)$   curves of the electron-only devices with a structure of \n\n  $\\mathrm{FTO/TiO}_{2}/$  perovskite/PCBM/Ag electrode.
