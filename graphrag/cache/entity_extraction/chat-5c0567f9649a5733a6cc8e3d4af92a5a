CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

The annealed samples finally form smooth,  relatively compact   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films with an average grain  size of   $253~\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure 2f provide information on the crystal structure of the three samples. As  shown,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film maintains the cubic phase even after  IPA washing and high temperature annealing. The loss or  weakening of some Bragg peaks indicates that the perovskite  shows octahedral tilts and rotations as the ligands are removed  and crystals grow.  Crystals within the annealed film are suggested to be highly oriented along the [100] and [110] direction.  The gradual narrowing of the Bragg peaks is observed as the  crystal size increases from SEM measurements. Time-resolved  PL (TRPL) spectroscopy was carried out on these   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  films. The results show that the PL lifetime tends to increase  with increasing crystal size (Figure   $2\\mathrm{g}.$  , Table S2, Supporting  Information), which is similar to previous reports.  \n\nMetallic Pb atoms can develop in perovskite and cause strong  exciton quenching,  and the charge recombination centers are  almost exclusively localized on the crystal surfaces rather than  in the bulk.  During the ligands removal process,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    films were soaked in the   $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{OAC})_{2}$   IPA solution. This results in  Pb atom-rich perovskite films (Figure S4, Supporting Information), and tends to have a high density of defect states. Optical  characterization in Figure 2b confirms the existence of surface  defects. As can be seen, the Stokes shift increases from   $18~\\mathrm{{nm}}$    in the as-prepared films to   $35~\\mathrm{nm}$   in the annealed ones. Since  the spontaneous radiative recombination between trap states  causes a red-shift in the PL peak compared with that from the  band edge transition,  the enhanced Stokes shift of the Pbrich  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film here clearly demonstrates the appearance of  surface defects.  \n\nDifferent pas siva ting agents such as fullerene,  nitrogendoped reduced graphene oxide,  the organic molecule iodopenta flu oro benzene,    $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  ,  thiophene, chlorine-capped   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   colloidal NCs,  and pyridine Lewis bases  have been  employed to passivate surface charge trap states of the perovskite. Here, we find a simple but effective interface passivation method by using commercially available P3HT. A thin  P3HT film coated on the top of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film suppresses trap  states and thus considerably reduces interface recombination  at the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}/\\mathrm{P3HT}$   interface. Steady-state PL and TRPL  decay measurements were conducted to investigate the charge  recombination occurring at the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}/\\mathrm{P3HT}$   interface. An  excitation light of   $405\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   was used, which has a penetration  depth of   ${\\approx}30\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , much less than the thickness of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    films (  $.200\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  . As shown in  Figure   3 a, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film  without a P3HT layer had an emission peak at   $664\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , and was  independent of the incident light directions. As expected, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   layer passivated by P3HT   $(\\approx\\!5\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   had a blue-shifted  emission peak from 664 to   $658\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  . The Stokes shift of  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    decreased from 35 to   $29~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   with the help of P3HT, indicating  pass iv ation of the surface trap states of the perovskite film.   TRPL spectroscopy was performed to evaluate the dynamics of  charge carrier recombination in the perovskite film after introducing P3HT. The film PL decay curves in Figure 3b also confirm the reduction of trap states. P3HT pass iv ation causes the  average lifetime of  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films increased from 6.91 to 14.8 ns  (Table S2, Supporting Information). Since the PL decay time  of P3HT is well below 1 ns,  we consequently attribute the  enhanced PL lifetime to the pass iv ation of defect states.  \n\nElectronic structure calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) were performed to characterize how P3HT  polymer can passivate the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   surface. First, the sulfur (S)  atoms are found to bond with Cs atoms   $(\\mathrm{Cs}{-}\\mathrm{S};4.03\\ \\mathring{\\mathrm{A}})$   on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  (110) surface (Figure 3c) and passivate the inter facial  positively charged under-coordinated   $C s^{+}$   ions. In addition, S  atoms also boned to   $\\mathrm{Pb}$     $(\\mathrm{S-Pb};~3.36~\\mathring\\mathrm{A})$  ) atoms and passivated  the antisite defects (Figure 3d), known as deep-level defects  and the most detrimental defects in perovskite solar cells.   Without P3HT, the electron distribution was localized around  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/f7194f76a10a3c491e1a42a90ef537c517f970b42f359f0d393ecdb8e45f27ed-1727116039.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films with P3HT layer using a  $405\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   laser as the excitation source from the perovskite film side (blue curve), from the glass side (blue shadow), and  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films without P3HT from the perovskite film  side (red curve). Inset shows the schematic of PL experiment setup. Note that we chose a   $405\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   laser as excitation source and a thin P3HT layer for  this experiment in order to avoid the influence from PL of P3HT. b) PL decay curves for  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   film, the  $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}/$  spiro-OMeTAD film, the  $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}/$  P3HT bilayer, and the annealed bilayer. The shorter decay time of the annealed   $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}/\\mathsf{P3H T}$   bilayer than the  $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}/$  spiro-OMeTAD film demonstrates the more efficient hole transfer from   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   film due to the strong interaction between   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   and P3HT.  $\\mathsf{c}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{e}$  ) Density distribution plots  of   $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   110-surface. c) P3HT on 110-surface, d) P3HT on 110-surface with antisite\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
