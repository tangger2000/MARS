CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Though an understanding of the atomic scale thermal activation is  challenging, the thermal enhanced optical performance of UCNPs  is elegant. Remarkably, Zhou et al. observed a 2000-fold increasing  in the blue emission of   $\\mathrm{Im}^{3+}$  -doped   $\\mathrm{{\\calN}a Y F_{4}}$   UCNPs when heating  from room temperature to   $180~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   occurred.  For the printed  anti counterfeiting mark using these UCNPs the “Tm ” is invisible  at room temperature but when heated to   $180~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   becomes bright  blue, whereas the other part composed by  $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$  -doped UCNPs suffers from the thermal quenching effect (Figure 4e). This kind of  anti counterfeiting marks employ two types of UCNPs that are  endowed with thermal-quenching and inverse thermal-quenching  effects respectively, making it difficult to forge.  \n\nIn addition to the precise design and fabrication of the  UCNPs with a specific optical response to external stimuli  toward anti counterfeiting applications, there is another trend  that focuses on integrating UCNPs with other kinds of fluorescent or non fluorescent materials to tune the fluorescence for  encoding for different aspects.  \n\nDual-mode fluorescence under varied excitation source  permitted by the hybridized UCNPs–semiconducting nanocomposites for anti counterfeiting purpose is also popular  nowadays. For instance, the anti counterfeiting marks printed  by UCNPs/carbon dots  and UCNPs/per ovsk ites  couplings  both exhibit distinct anti-Stokes emission and Stokes emission under   $980~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   and UV excitation s, respectively. Aiming at  increasing the encoding capacity, the integration of persistent  fluorescence materials and UCNPs is rapidly developing. In a  typical design by Zhang and co-workers,  the absorption of  the persistent phosphors employed overlaps with the emission  of UCNPs. In this way, the photons of UV/blue emission from  UCNPs are absorbed by the persistent phosphors. Once the   $980~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   laser to excite the UCNPs is cutoff, the energy stored  in electron traps can be released to obtain the persistent fluorescence. Remarkably, this design of UCNP composite not only  improves the encoding capacity for anti counterfeiting taggants  but also decreases the decoding error rate owing to the fluorescence chromatic aberration of the two kinds of materials.  \n\nThe non fluorescent material tuning always involves a  variation of up conversion by integrating materials that not  only fluoresce by themselves but can also enable the photonic  effect. For example, it is reported by Song’s group that a collection of nanoparticles, such as poly methyl meth a cry late (PMMA)  opal photonic crystals,  AuNPs,  $\\mathrm{Ta}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{5}$   nanoparticles,  and   $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2\\cdot x}S$   nanoparticles  are capable of enhancing the UCNPs’  fluorescence at a specific wavelength by means of the surface plasmon. More interestingly, the reflectivity and photonic  bandgap of these nanoparticles change with the observation  angle, allowing the fabrication of angle-dependent anti counterfeiting marks.  \n\n# 5. Anti counterfeiting Printing Technologies  \n\nAnti counterfeiting ink is a direct and facile form of transforming a variety of nanoparticles into real-world applications. Before they are widely accepted by different printing  technologies, surface modification strategies should be available to render luminescent nanoparticles either hydrophobic  or hydrophilic so as for them to be stable in the suspension  of security inks. These include surface treatments of the assynthesized nanoparticles to become compatible with the ink  cartridge  or ligand-exchange processes to transfer the nanoparticles to the aqueous phase.  To achieve both the long-term  stability and sufficient loading efficiency of nanoparticles into  the inks, Kellar and co-workers have developed a nano emulsion  approach.  The as-synthesized UCNPs can be encapsulated  in the oil droplets with the out surface protected by stabilizing  agents so that both the viscosity and surface tension of this ink  can be easily adjusted in an inkjet printer. The ink has been  shown to stay stable for over 7 months.  \n\nVarious printing technologies are also available to cover the  needs of fabricating anti counterfeiting marks at different levels.  They are generally categorized into direct printing and templated printing ( Figure   5 ), and each of the methods has varied  resolution and printing speeds. The choice of printing method  depends on the constraints of cost, complexity, and desired resolution and the nature of the products to be protected.  \n\nStamping (Figure 5a) is favorable for the rapid encryption  on any surface, object, or document for its ease in printing  and cost-effectiveness.  Inkjet printing is the most  common form of printing today. It allows any digital image  to be recreated onto the substrate of choice with identical  reproducibility. The most widespread use of inkjet printers  for printing up conversion anti counterfeiting marks involves  the modification of a preexisting commercial inkjet printer  (Figure 5b).  Aerosol jet printers have been applied  in the same manner as inkjet printers but for higher printing  resolution and larger ink viscosity range.  The aerosol jet  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/b668388f1717711613f09b1fc2b7114dbbef45fb61a614f472137c6ad671f8ab-1727124586.jpg)  \nFigure 5.   Various direct and templated printing technologies available for fabricating multiscale anti counterfeiting marks. a) Top: stamping and direct  writing are the most achievable methods for fabricating anti counterfeiting marks.

The careful consideration in choosing dispersive medium allows the anticounterfeiting marks to be printed on substrates such as paper and  polyethylene terephthalate (Figure 5d).  Photolithography  techniques use light to transfer a pattern onto a substrate to  micro fabricate UCNPs into anti counterfeiting applications  (Figure 5e). By employing the photolithography method, the  UCNPs have been printed as anti counterfeiting marks with line  widths as narrow as   $50~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   as demonstrated by Kim et al. Electrical nano imprint lithography (e\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
