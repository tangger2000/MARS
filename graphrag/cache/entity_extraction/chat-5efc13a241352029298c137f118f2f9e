CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

XPS analysis is conducted to characterize the surface chemical states of perovskite films. A mixedcation lead iodide perovskite film is prepared by using a recipe  of   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   (where FA and MA denote form amid in i um  and methyl ammonium, respectively). As shown in Figure S1,  Supporting Information, a typical F 1s peak appears at   $688~\\mathrm{eV}$  in the perovskite with DFPDA additive, confirming that DFPDA  has been successfully introduced into the final perovskite film.  Compared with the control perovskite film, the peaks from Pb 4f  and I 3d are all shifted to higher binding energies in the perovskite film with DFPDA additive (Figure  2c,d), indicating the  strong electronic interactions between the DFPDA and   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   and   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   in the perovskite  $\\mathrm{flm}^{[22,23]}$   and suggesting that the perovskite  surface can be electrostatic ally passivated by DFPDA. A peak at \n\n  ${\\approx}532.7\\,\\mathrm{eV}$   is assigned to O1s from the carbonyl groups in DFPDA \n\n (Figure 2e), which further confirms the presence of DFPDA on  the surface of the perovskite film.  Meanwhile, an adjacent  peak at   ${\\approx}534.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   is attributed to absorbed oxygen and moisture  from the air.  It is obvious that the amount of absorbed oxygen  and moisture from the environment was significantly decreased  after the addition of DFPDA, which benefits the stability of the  perovskite and is consistent with the calculated results (Tables S2  and S3, Supporting Information).  \n\nFrom the previous calculations and experimental analysis,  DFPDA can strongly interact with the perovskite precursor,  thus affecting its crystallization rate and improving its crystall iz ation quality. In order to study the role of DFPDA in  perovskite growth, the perovskite precursor films with and  without DFPDA were annealed at  $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for different times. As  shown in  Figure   3 a, both freshly coated perovskite precursor  films are transparent. The control film gradually turns from  transparent to brick red (10s), then to dark brown (20s), and  finally to black (60s). In contrast, the color variation of the precursor film with DFPDA additive is much slower than that of  the control film during the annealing process. The film with  DFPDA gradually changes from transparent to brownish red  after   $60~\\mathrm{s}$   and requires annealing at high temperature   $(100\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  to turn to black. In the preparation process of the perovskite  precursor film,   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   as a Lewis acid first coordinates with the  Lewis base dimethyl s ulf oxide (DMSO) in the perovskite precursor solution due to their high coordinated energy (Table S1,  Supporting Information). The FAI-MAI $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  -DMSO intermediate phase is obtained after anti-solvent treatment. As shown in the FTIR spectra (Figure  3b), when the perovskite precursor film was annealed at   $60\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $60\\ \\mathrm{~s~}$  , the   $S=\\mathrm{O}$   peak of the DMSO almost disappeared, which means  that the adducted DMSO is evaporated in the low-temperature annealing process. Meanwhile, a red-shift of the   $C=\\mathrm{O}$  vibration in DFPDA from 1718 to   $1699~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  is observed upon  interaction of DFPDA with perovskite, indicating that DFPDA  replaced DMSO to form a new DFPDA $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   adduct. Compared  with bare   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   ions, the larger steric hindrance of coordinated  adducts (DFPDA $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2})$   inhibits   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   from rapidly binding with   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  , and  $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   ions, which decreases the number of nucleations and slows the crystallization rate of the perovskite.

Thus,  DFPDA would increase the grain size of the perovskite film  by reducing the nucleation density and prolonging the nucleation time. Meanwhile, the DFPDA molecules exist in the final  perovskite film, which is confirmed by the existence of   $C=\\mathrm{O}$  and   $_{\\mathrm{C-F}}$   peaks in the FTIR spectra even after the film has  been annealed at   $180\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.$  . The remaining DFPDA molecules  form covalent and hydrogen bonds, respectively, with undercoordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   ions that can act as defect sites, and  these bonds could passivate such defects at the GBs and surface of the perovskite film.  \n\nIn order to further study the effect of DFPDA additive on  the perovskite film, DFPDA was added into the perovskite  precursor comprising  $0.1\\mathrm{-}1.2~\\mathrm{mol}\\%$   of DFPDA with respect to   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$  . Top-view SEM images of perovskite films with different  concentrations of DFPDA additive are exhibited in  Figure   4 a,  and the corresponding grain size distributions are summarized  in Figure  4b. The grain size is increased when DFPDA concentration is increased from 0 to   $0.4\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\%$  , while it is reduced  when the concentration is further increased to   $0.8{-}1.2~\\mathrm{mol}\\%$  .  The average grain sizes of the perovskite films without and with   $0.4\\;\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\%$   DFPDA are 304 and   $746~\\mathrm{~nm}$  , respectively. The  increased grain size is attributed to the formation of a  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  -DFPDA  adduct, which increases the activation energy and decreases  the number of nucleation s, as discussed before.  Water  contact-angle measurements are carried out to investigate the  ability of the perovskite films to resist water (Figure 4c). With  the increase of DFPDA concentration, the contact angle of  the perovskite film increases. This increasing contact angle  is possibly due to the fluorine ions of DFPDA on the perovskite surface, which should enhance the humidity tolerance  of the perovskite films and mitigate their degradation in air.  The morph o logie s of the perovskite films with different concent rations of DFPDA additives are further studied by atomic  force microscopy, as shown in Figure 4d, where the perovskite  film with   $0.4~\\mathrm{mol}\\%$   DFPDA\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
