CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

  a) Schematics of the in situ KPFM electrical nanotechnology (using a Pt/Ir conductive tip) of CsPbBr 3 /PMMA/pentacene film. The scanning  area and scan rate are   $10\\,\\upmu\\mathsf{m}\\times10\\,\\upmu\\mathsf{m}$   and   $0.8\\mapstoz$  , respectively. The tip–surface distance for surface potential measurement is  $75~\\mathsf{n m}$   for all measurements (resolution: 256 pixels  $\\times\\,256$   pixels). The inset shows the surface potential variation mechanism. b) Surface potential of the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{P M M A}/$  pentacene film before and after different light illumination treatments (fixed light intensity:  $0.153\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  ) recorded by in situ AFM electrical nanotechnology (scale bar,   $2~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$  ). c) Surface potential profile recorded for the  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{P M M A}/$  pentacene film illuminated by different light wavelengths  with fixed intensity   $0.153\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  . d) Schematic image of the process of charge injection to   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs layer using a   $\\mathsf{P t}/\\mathsf{I r}$   conductive tip. A combination of contact mode and KPFM mode was used. First, respective  $^{-6}$   and  $+6\\,\\lor$   tip bias was applied on the conductive AFM tip in the AFM contact  mode to inject electrons and holes (scan rate:   $0.8\\mapsto z$  ; scanning area:   $1~{\\upmu\\mathsf{m}}\\times1~{\\upmu\\mathsf{m}},$  ; resolution: 256 pixels  $\\times\\,256$   pixels). Then, the surface potential  measurements are carried out by the amplitude modulation KPFM mode, of which the scanning area and scan rate were   $10\\,\\upmu\\mathsf{m}\\times10\\,\\upmu\\mathsf{m}$   and   $0.8\\mapstoz$  ,   $3\\ \\mathsf{h}$   (scale bar,  $1~{\\upmu m})$  ). f) Surface potential  difference derived from (e).  \n\nthe device was light stimulated by the light with fixed intensity  of   $0.153~\\mathrm{\\mW~}\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$   and wavelengths ranging from 660 to   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  . The surface potential is found to be light-wavelengthdependent.  As displayed in Figure 4b, the surface potential  steadily increases from 134.84, 199.24, 264.22 to   $325.13\\,\\mathrm{\\mV}$  when the wavelength of light illumination located at 660, 520,  450, and  $365\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , respectively. It is worth noting that the Bruker  Dimension Icon AFM which is used for the KPFM measurement is equipped with  $670\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   laser. Therefore, slight shiftment  might be generated in the measured potential. In general, the  increase of surface potential is stemmed from the aggregation  of holes or loss of electrons.  As mentioned before, light illumination on the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs film can trigger generation of  photo carriers. The photo generated holes can easily escape from  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   to pentacene through a bending of energy band  and thus leaving behind photoinduced electrons in the conduction band of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   which induces an abrupt increase of  surface potential.  \n\nTo further confirm the hypothesis, the trapping capacity of  electrons and holes was evaluated separately.  Two   $1\\,\\times\\,1\\,\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$  areas of the perovskite film were scanned at   $+6$   and   $-6\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   to  inject holes and electrons along the horizontal direction  (Figure 4d). The dynamic variation process of the charge transport was recorded with a time-accelerated mode, and several  snapshots of the surface potential are shown in Figure 4e. The  bright region indicates the electron-trapping state, and the dark  region corresponds to the hole-trapping state.  The contrast  change of the hole injected area was completely different  from the electron injected area, with a quicker vanish speed,  indicating a fast drift speed of the injected holes through the  perovskite layer. Compared with the initial state after the charge  injection in the upper panel of Figure 4e, the surface potential  only exhibited  ${\\approx}30\\%$   variation after   $3\\mathrm{~h~}$   for the electron injected  area, while   ${\\approx}74\\%$   reduction is estimated for the  hole injected  area.  The deeply trapped electrons give evidence to the lightinduced synapse properties of the device and the persistence  of the photonic memory.  Consequently, KPFM results  obtained from charge trapping operations strongly support our  hypothesis that the photonic synapse behavior of our device  originates from the electron trapping ability of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    QDs layer.  \n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs-based photonic memory and its implementation of synaptic  functions. By employing the type II he t ero structure of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs and pentacene which is capable of restricting the photogenerated electrons, the photonic memory device exhibits lightinduced charge trapping and electrical-mediated charge release  characteristics, allowing optical programming operation and  electrical erasing operation at device level.  In addition, SRDP,  STP, and LTP modulated by the optical way were elucidated to  emulate the synaptic connection rule in the human brain. The  photonic potenti ation and electrical habituation were successfully emulated.  KPFM is used to visualize the redistribution  charge induced by the photonic stimulation. These results shift  the paradigm in photonic synapse as serving in terms of performance and understanding, which remain challenging in this  community.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe  authors  acknowledge  the  grants  from  Natural  Science  Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61601305 and 61604097), the  Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen  (Grant  Nos.  JCYJ20170302145229928,  JCYJ20170302151653768,  JCYJ20170818143618288,  KQJSCX20170727100433270,  and  KQJSCX20170327150812967),  Guangdong  Provincial  Department  of Science and Technology (Grant Nos. 2018 B 030306028 and  2017 A 010103026), the Department of Education of Guangdong Province  (Grant Nos. 2015 K Q NC X 141 and 2016 KTS CX 120), NTUT-SZU Joint  Research Program (Grant No. 2018007), and the Natural Science  Foundation of SZU.  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ncharge trapping, flash memory, perovskite, photonic synapse, quantum  dots  \n\nReceived: May 5, 2018 Revised: June 21, 2018 Published online:  \n\n[1]\t S. Mani pat run i, D. E. Nikonov, I. A. Young,  Nat. Phys.   2018 ,  14 , 338.\n\n [2]\t C. Liu, X. Yan, X. Song, S. Ding, D. W. Zhang, P. Zhou,  Nat. Nano- technol.   2018 ,  13 , 404.\n\n [3]\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
