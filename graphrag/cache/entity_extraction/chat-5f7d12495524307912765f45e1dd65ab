CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

After the perovskite film forma­ tion, the DPSI molecules can neutralize the charged defects at  the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite film using  their positively and negatively charged components, as illus­ trated in Figure 1b.   Figure   2 a,b shows the scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) images of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   films without and  with adding of   $0.05\\%$   DPSI molecules, respectively. The for­ mation of pinholes was greatly suppressed for the films with  DPSI in the precursor solution. The enlarged SEM images in  Figure 2c,d show that the films with DPSI possess much more  uniform grain size. The corresponding grain size distribution  is summarized in Figure 2e. The average grain size of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  film with   $0.05\\%$   DPSI is   ${\\approx}203\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}}$  , which is about   $48\\;\\mathrm{\\nm}$  smaller than that of the pristine   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   film, but the grain size  distribution is much narrower. It indicates that the DPSI mole­ cules retarded and well controlled each perovskite grain growth  to uniform size and eventually construct a compact perovskite  film. The grain size was further reduced, and some aggregation  appeared when the DPSI concentration increased to   $0.01\\%$  , as  shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).  \n\nTo explore the impact of the DPSI on the perovskite film  crystal structure, we collected X-ray diffraction (XRD) pat­ terns of the films with different DPSI concentrations and  calculated the peak intensity ratio between (110) and (312),  as shown in Figure 2f and in Figure S3 (Supporting Informa­ tion), respectively. The result shows that, with increasing of the  DPSI concentration to   $0.05\\%$  , the (110) peak intensity and the  ratio between the (110) and (312) peaks at 14.1 and 31.8 were  increased, which may arise from the grain orientation change.  \n\nThe   $\\mathsf{p-i-n}$   planar cell configuration used in this study was  structured as poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)amine] \n\n (PTAA)/OIHPs/phenyl $\\cdot C_{61}$  -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/\n\n  ${\\sf C}_{60}/$  bath o cup roi ne (BCP)/copper   $(\\mathrm{Cu})$  . Considering that the  charge carrier extraction efficiency strongly depends on the  amount of the insulating molecules that introduced into  perov­ skite film, we first studied the effect of DPSI mole­ cule  concentration on the device performance.  Figure    3 a shows  the photo current curves of perovskite devices with different  amount of DPSI which were tuned by varying the concentra­ tion of DPSI in the   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   precursor solution. The control  device without DPSI showed typical performance with a shortcircuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$   of   $22.6\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.08\\;\\mathrm{V},$   a  fill factor (FF) of   $75.0\\%$  , and a PCE of   $18.4\\%$  . When the DPSI  concentration was increased to   $0.01\\%$   and   $0.05\\%$  , the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  was  significantly increased to 1.10 and   $1.12\\;\\mathrm{~V},$   respectively. The  best   $\\mathrm{{\\bfA}P b I_{3}}$   devices were made by the precursor solution  with   $0.05\\%$   DPSI, exhibiting a significantly improved perfor­ mance with a   $J_{S C}$   of   $22.8\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.12~\\mathrm{V},$   an FF of   $79.0\\%$  , and a PCE of   $20.2\\%$  . We also checked the photocur­ rent hysteresis of the devices with   $0.05\\%$   DPSI, and negligible  photo current hysteresis was observed, as shown in Figure  S4  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/ee3cfe508e25448c194d85737be473a5fd0d7490615c6b030ed5ebd2beb5babd-1723833511.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $J-V$   characteristics of   $\\mathsf{M A P b}|_{3}$   devices with different amounts of  DPSI. b)  $J-V$   characteristics of  $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.85}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.15}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{B r}_{0.15}\\mathsf{I}_{0.85})_{3}$   devices with and without DPSI. c) Steady-state photo current and efficiency at the maximum  power point (0.96 V) of the optimized  $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.85}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.15}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{B r}_{0.15}\\mathsf{I}_{0.85})_{3}$   device with DPSI. d) EQE and integrated  $J_{S C}$   for the optimized  $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.85}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.15}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{B r}_{0.15}\\mathsf{I}_{0.85})_{3}$  device with DPSI. e)  $J-V$  characteristics of  $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.85}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.15}\\mathsf{P\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
