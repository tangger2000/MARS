CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

In this case, a necessary condition is an additional appropriate initiator either thermal  initiator (such as   $_{2,2^{\\prime}}$  -azobis(2-methyl pro pio nitrile), AIBN) or  UV-light initiator (such as diphenyl(2,4,6-tri methyl b enzo yl) phosphine oxide, TPO) into monomer or polymers complex  solution (Figure  4b,c).  However, some polymers show  a large discrepancy in polarity with the surface of PQDs.  Blending PQDs with polymers at microscale level often result  in a heterogeneous phase aggregation and decreasing optical  intensity.  The reported thermal-polymer i zed   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  polymer composites showed very low PLQYs about   $7.3\\%$    (PMMA),   $9.2\\%$   (PBMA), and   $0.7\\%$   (PS). Hence, the right solution is to control up limit of PQDs in polymers and select  proper appropriate initiators.  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs can be blended with ionic salts for  good preservation of initial high PLQYs as well. As shown in  Figure  4d, the detailed process of encapsulating PQDs into  potassium (K) halide salts is divided into four steps. First,  PQDs was added into the solution contain potassium (K)  halide salts. Additionally, potassium (K) halide salts containing  colloidal prepared PQDs crystallized from saturated aqueous  solutions, followed by removal of solvent under vacuum. After,  transparent pellets were obtained with a “cold flow” process at  moderate pressures. Specially, a necessary condition is taken  into account is lattice parameters when embedding PQDs in  ionic salts.  \n\nBesides, straightly depositing an amorphous alumina   $(\\mathrm{SiO}_{x})$    matrix on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs films was realized by low temperature  atomic layer deposition using tri methyl aluminum (TMA) and   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$   as precursor and coreactant, respectively. The nucleation  and growth process of   $\\mathrm{{AlO}}_{x}$   highlighted the importance of the  interaction between ALD precursor and the surface of PQDs.

These   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{AO}_{x}$   also showed exceptional stability towards air, irradiation under simulated solar  spectrum conditions, heat and water.  Although physical  method is diverse using various encapsulation materials, it  is of central importance to avoid aggregation of PQDs and  partial encapsulation with a significant number of unprotected PQDs.  \n\n# 3.4. Micro encapsulation  \n\nMicro encapsulation strategy mainly refers to formation of  protective layer on PQDs at macroscale via a self-organization  process. The matrix forming a coherent barrier layer protect  PQDs from water, oxygen or heat intimately. Usually, microencap sul ation can be realized via some special physical process as  swelling–deswelling process of polymer or self-crystallization of  glass in high temperature reaction.  \n\nThe dynamic swelling–deswelling process of polymer  enables a successful encapsulation for PQDs at macroscale.  Wang et  al. dissolved polymers and precursors of PQDs in  solvent such as chloroform or DMF under normal laboratory  atmosphere. PQDs formed via a spontaneous self-organization  process companied with evaporation of solvent. Meanwhile,  polymers deswell, shrink back and form a robust hydrophobic  shells around PQDs ( Figure    5 a). A good dispersed crystalline  PQDs within amorphous PS matrix was certificated from highsolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Figure 5b). Further size and  density measurement via cross-sectional TEM indicated a clear  embedding-depth-dependence relation.  Always, polymers  can act as multi dent ate ligands to passivate surface of PQDs  intimately, resulting a well dispersion of PQDs with high efficiency against water, oxygen, or heat.  Usually, microencapsulation for PQDs by swelling–deswelling process can  be extended to most polymers including polycarbonate (PC),  acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), cellulose acetate (CA),  polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and S4-vinyl benz yl-dimethyl oct adec yl ammonium chloride (V18) and some diblock copolymer  as polystyreneblock -poly-2-vinyl pyr i dine (PSb -P2VP). Specially,  the multi dent ate pyridine groups of P2VP block can form  multi dent ate capping shell and closely bind on surface of PQDs  with an excellent pass iv ation.  \n\nGlass is more stabilized and tighter medium, fitting for  encapsulating PQDs. By designing appropriate glass composition, micro encapsulation inside glass can be realized by  the self-crystallization of PQDs and a conventional melting– quenching technique. Usually, raw materials mixed with molar  compositions melt in an alumina crucible at constant temperature for a period time. The glass can be casted on a copper  block and pressed to form a plate with desirable thickness.
