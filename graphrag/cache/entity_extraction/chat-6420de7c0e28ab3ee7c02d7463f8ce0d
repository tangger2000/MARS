CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The performance enhancement was  tentatively attributed to the improved film morphology and the  passivated grain boundaries achieved by the dual functions of  the DPSI molecules. The   $J{-}V$  curve in Figure  3a and the sta­ tistical result in Figure  S5 (Supporting Information) show  that further increasing DPSI concentration to   $0.1\\%$   severely  reduced the   $J_{S C},\\ V_{O C},$  , and FF, and the  $J{-}V$  curve, which indi­ cates that the device with excess DPSI possesses high series  resistance   $(R_{S},\\ 1494.9\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   that decreases the   $J_{S C}$   and FF.  The   $R_{S}$   for the device without DPSI is   $78.4~\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  . The under­ lying reason for the bad performance of the device with excess  DPSI may because the increased thickness of the insulating  layer surrounding the perovskite grains reduced electron tun­ neling rate.

The stabilized PCE was measured to determine  the real power output of the device by monitoring the photo­ current of the device under an applied bias at the maximum  power point under AM 1.5G illumination. It exhibited a stabi­ lized efficiency of   $21.1\\%$   at the maximum power point (0.96 V)  for testing over   $2000~\\mathrm{s}_{\\mathrm{i}}$  , which matched well with the PCE value  extracted from the  $J{-}V$  curve (Figure 3c). The external quantum  efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Figure 3d) exhibited a broad region  range from 400 to   $760~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   with EQE well above   $85\\%$   because  of strong light absorption within the perovskite film, and the  EQE reached   $90\\%$   in some wavelength range of   $400{-}450\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ,  which is in accordance with the highest trans pa rence peak of  the indium–tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate. The EQE spectrum  showed an integrated   $J_{S C}$   of   $22.6\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , which agreed well  with the  $J{-}V$   results. As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Infor­ mation), the statistics PCE values of 40 devices demonstrate the  reproducibility and reliability of the performance enhancement  by introducing of DPSI.  \n\nWe examined the stability of un encapsulated devices stored  in the dark in a glove box filled with nitrogen as well as encap­ sulated devices under AM 1.5G illumination in ambient con­ dition. It was found that the devices maintained almost their  original efficiency when stored in the nitrogen-filled glove box  in the dark for   $2880\\ \\mathrm{h}$   (4 months) (Figure 3e). The initial PV  parameters for the device with DPSI are a  $J_{S C}$   of  $22.6\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,  a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.12\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{V}}$   an FF of   $79.4\\%$  , and a PCE of   $20.1\\%$  . The  PV parameters of the device after   $2880\\ \\mathrm{h}$   storage are a   $J_{S C}$   of \n\n  $23.1~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.15~\\mathrm{V},$  , an FF of   $75.3\\%$  , and a PCE of \n\n  $20.0\\%$  . The real application requires perovskite solar cells to  be stable under sun illumination. To evaluate the operational  stability of devices with DPSI, we monitored the   $J{-}V$  charac­ teristics of the encapsulated device under simulated AM 1.5G  illumination without using an ultraviolet filter. The device  with DPSI retained   $88\\%$   of their initial performance after   $480\\,\\mathrm{~h~}$   under continuous AM 1.5G illumination, as shown in  Figure  3f.
