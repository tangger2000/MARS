CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Meanwhile,   $70\\;\\mathrm{\\sf~m}\\mathrm{g}\\;\\mathrm{\\sf~P}\\mathsf{b}\\mathsf{B}\\mathsf{r}_{2}$  (  $.|88\\,\\mathrm{~\\upmu m o l})$  was suspended in a solution of   $5~\\mathsf{m L}$   ODE, 0.5 mLDPA, and   $0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  oleylmaine in a  $50~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   three-neck flask. Both the two suspensions were  heated to   $120~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  under vacuum with stirring, with the temperature  maintained for   $\\sf{\\Delta}\\sf{\\Delta}\\sf{\\sf h}$   to degas. After the dissolution of the   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   and \n\n  $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$  , the temperature of the solutions was increased to   $\\mathsf{T}40~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   under \n\n  $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   and was kept for another  $30\\;\\mathsf{m i n}$  . Then,   $0.4~{\\sf m L C s}$   precursor solution  was injected into the   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   solution, which immediately yielded a bright  green solution. After   $5\\,\\mathrm{~s~}$  , the flask was submersed in a water bath to  quench the reaction. The crude solution in ODE was then mixed with  the anti solvent iso prop an ol in a volume ratio of ODE:   $|\\mathsf{P A}=1{\\cdot}3$  , then  centrifuged for   $5~\\mathsf{m i n}$   at 10  000 rpm to precipitate the QDs. These  QDs were free of excess ligands, avoiding the trap states that provided  a pathway for the exciton recombination, which was detrimental for  QD-based op to electronic applications.  Afterward, the transparent  super nat ant was discarded and the QDs pellet was re dispersed in  toluene with for future usage.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : The   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs based X-ray detector devices  were fabricated on   $\\mathsf{S i O}_{2}/\\mathsf{S i}$   substrate and flexible PET substrate,  respectively. First, the silica wafers with a   $300\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   thick   ${\\sf S i O}_{2}$   and PET  substrates were rinsed in an ultrasonic bath in acetone, ethanol, and  deionized water for 20 min each. Then source–drain contacts were  defined on the substrate using the photolithography process with  electrode array mask. After that, electrodes were deposited on the  defined region by electron-beam evaporation of   $\\mathsf{C r/A u}$     $(\\,^{1}5/50\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\,\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m})$  in vacuum with a chamber pressure of   ${<}6\\,\\times\\,7\\,0^{-6}$   Torr. The channel  length between the source and drain electrodes was around   $10~\\upmu\\mathsf{m}$  .  Finally, two copper wires were linked with two electrodes, which were  used to export the photo current to the source meter unit (Keithley  2400 series).  \n\nInkjet Printing of the Perovskite Film : The obtained QDs solution  was printed onto the   ${\\sf S i O}_{2}$   substrate and flexible PET substrate by a  piezoelectric inkjet printer (Fujifilm Dimatix DMP-2831) with a cartridge  (10 pL drop volume, DMC-11610). Before the printing process, the ink  was ultrasonic a ted for 5 min to get the well-dispersed   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs  solution. Then the perovskite ink was printed on the central region of  each counter electrode. As the droplets evaporated, uniform and highquality perovskite film formed on targeted regions. The size and region  of each film can be controlled by the Dimatix drop manager software  during the printing process. The applied jetting voltage was set between  25 and   $35~\\lor,$   and the frequency was set to   $23\\ \\mathsf{k H z}$  . The temperature of  the platen was held at  $30~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .  \n\nCharacterizations : The morph o logie s and surface topographies  were measured by the atomic force microscope (Bruker, Dimension  Icon SPM). UV–vis absorbance spectra for suspensions of QDs in  toluene were collected using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV–vis-NIR  spectrometer. For powder XRD measurements, samples were prepared  by depositing suspensions of QDs in toluene on a glass substrate and  heating the substrate at   $80^{\\circ}$   to evaporate the toluene. XRD patterns  were acquired on a Bruker D8 Advance diffract o meter using a  $\\mathsf{C u}$   source   $(\\mathsf{K}\\alpha=1.\\mathsf{\\dot{5}}4\\,\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}})$   at 40 kV, 40 mA, and a LynxEye detector. The samples were  scanned from   $\\,]0^{\\circ}$   to   $60^{\\circ}$   with a step size of   $0.02^{\\circ}$  . The micro structure  of the sample and electron diffraction pattern were obtained by a TEM  microscope (FEI, Tecnai   $\\mathsf{G}^{2}\\uparrow\\!20)$  ) equipped with a   $\\mathsf{L a B}_{6}$   electron source  operated at   $200\\;\\mathrm{\\kV.}$   Images were acquired by either a Gatan Orius  SC200D CCD camera or a Gatan Orius SC600 CCD camera. The surface  morphology of the sample was measured in the amplitude-modulated  tapping mode. Optical images and micro-PL measurements were  obtained by using a confocal microscope system (WITec, alpha 300R)  with a  $100\\times$  objective lens   $({\\mathsf{N A}}=0.9)$  ) in ambient conditions. A  $450\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  laser was used to excite samples, which was placed on a piezo-crystalcontrolled scanning stage.  \n\nX-Ray Detection : The used   $\\mathsf X$  -ray source is a soft-X-ray beamline in  Australia Synchrotron. The energy range is about 100–2500 eV, which  is suitable for study the   $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray detecting properties of the perovskite  as the X-ray radiation is effectively absorbed inside the   $600\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\mathsf{n}\\mathsf{m}$  film. The dose rate was measured by a portable Radiation Monitor  Controller (Radcal Corporation Model 9010). The effective area can  refer to the focal spot size at the sample which is about   $0.0006\\ {\\mathsf{\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
