Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a.

Introduction  \n\nHigh-quality backlit display puts forward urgent demand for colorconverting materials. Recently, metal halide per ovsk ites (MHPs) with full  spectral tunability, high photo luminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), and  high color purity have found potential application in wide-color-gamut  display. Regrettably, naked MHPs suffer from long-term instable issue and  cannot pass harsh stability tests. Herein, amorphous-glass-protected green/ red  $\\mathsf{c s P b X}_{3}$   quantum dots (QDs) are prepared by elaborately optimizing  glass structure, perovskite concentration, and in situ crystallization. PLQYs  of green   $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}\\textcircled{o}$  glass and red  $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{1.5}\\mathsf{I}_{1.5}\\textcircled{o}$  glass reach  $94\\%$   and   $\\mathbf{\\lambda78\\%}$  ,  respectively, which are the highest ones of   $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\textcircled{o}$  glass composites  reported so far and comparable to colloidal counterparts. Benefited from  complete isolation of QDs from external environment by glass network, \n\n  $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\textcircled{o}$  glass can endure harsh commercial standard aging tests of \n\n  $\\mathbf{85\\,\\,^{\\circ}C}/\\mathbf{85\\%\\,\\mathsf{R H}}$   and blue-light-irradiation, which are applied to construct  white light-emitting diodes (wLEDs) with high external quantum efficiency  of  ${\\bf13.8\\%}$   and ultra-high luminance of   $500\\,000\\;{\\sf c d}\\;{\\sf m}^{-2}$  . Accordingly, the  perovskite wLED arrays-based backlit unit and a prototype display device  are designed for the first time, showing more vivid and wide-color-gamut  feature benefited from narrowband emissions of   $\\mathsf{c s P b X}_{3}$   QDs. This work  highlights practical application of   $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\textcircled{o}$  glass composite as an efficient  and stable light color converter in backlit display.  \n\nQDs are a unique type of emitters with  size-tunable emissions, high color purity,  PLQY, and excellent solution processability.  The well-developed CdSe-based  QDs have been commercially used as  light-conversion materials (LCMs) for  back-lighting in liquid-crystal displays  (LCDs) to improve color gamut, leading  to the booming of QD televisions in  market.  For example, the color gamut  of LCD using conventional phosphors  as LCM is   ${\\approx}72\\%$  of National Television  System Committee (NTSC) standard,  which can be improved to   ${\\approx}110\\%$   of NTSC  standard after utilizing QD-LCM.  However, the widely used CdSe-based QDs  have been widely limited by many countries for the presence of toxic heavy metal  cadmium element. Therefore, searching  non-Cd QDs for wide-color-gamut LCD is  highly demanded.  \n\nAs one of the hottest op to electronic  materials, MHPs have been proven to  be excellent light emitters, and attracted  attention for their potential in electroluminescent (EL) LEDs.  By engineering  their structure and composition, MHPs show the ability of  \n\nfull spectral tunability in the visible region,  $1\\approx\\!100\\%$   PLQY,   and ultra-narrow full width at half maximum (fwhm, down to   $12~\\mathrm{nm}$  ).  In the past few years, perovskite LED efficiency has  enhanced in external quantum efficiency (EQE) from   $0.0125\\%$    to   ${>}20\\%$   (blue:   $14.82\\%$  , green:   $28.9\\%$  , red:   $25.8\\%$  , white:   $12.2\\%)$  .  Notably, the EL-LEDs (self-emissive devices using  the current-driving mode) are used for active-matrix displays  rather than back-lighting LCDs, which has still a long-way to  go for the commercialization of this exciting technology. On  the contrary, the phosphors-converted PL-LEDs have been well  developed, and the commercial backlit unit in LCDs consisting  of InGaN blue chip and conventional phosphors, such as   $\\mathrm{Y}_{3}\\mathrm{Al}_{5}\\mathrm{O}_{12}$  : Ce (YAG: Ce),  $\\beta$  SiAlON:   $\\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$  , and   $\\mathrm{K}_{2}\\mathrm{SiF}_{6}$  :   $\\mathrm{Mn^{4+}}$  .   Therefore, the replacement of conventional phosphors by  MHPs to construct wLEDs as back-lighting unit used in LCD  is an effective way to enlarge color gamut and has promising  commercial application.  \n\nRegrettably, naked MHPs suffers from long-term instable  issue, which cannot pass harsh stability tests, especially the  commercial standards of   $85^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/85\\%$   RH stability and blue–lightirradiation stability. Among several reported strategies,   embedding MHPs inside robust inorganic glass is believed to  be feasible for the effective isolation of MHPs from external  environment. To date, all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$     $(\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Cl}$  , Br, and I)  perovskite QDs (PeQDs) have been successfully precipitated  in a variety of glasses via in situ nucleation/growth.   However, unlike wet-chemical synthesis, the dense glass network structure will hinder the diffusion of   $C s^{+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  , and   $X^{-}$   ions, and impede   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   nano crystallization inside glass,  which makes PLQYs of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass lower than those of  colloidal counterparts. Herein, we have successfully optimized   $\\mathrm{SiO_{2}{\\cdot}B_{2}O_{3}{\\cdot}Z n O{\\cdot}C a F_{2}}$   glass network, perovskite component concentrations, and glass crystallization conditions  to fabricate high-quality   $\\mathrm{CsPbX}_{3}@\\mathrm{glass}$  . PLQYs of green   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  glass and red   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{I}_{1.5}@;$  glass can reach as high  as   $93.8\\%$   and   $78.1\\%$  , respectively, which are the highest values  for  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass composites as far as we know (Tables S1 and  S2, Supporting Information). Importantly, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass  exhibits excellent long-term stability, and satisfies commercial  standards of   $85^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/85\\%$   RH and blue-light-irradiation stability.  As an application demo, a high-brightness wLED with EQE  of   $13.84\\%$   and luminance of   $500\\,000\\,\\,\\mathrm{cd}\\,\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   is designed and  applied in back-lighting module to realize wide-color-gamut display with   $127\\%$   of NTSC standard.  \n\n# 2. Result and Discussion  \n\nThe glass network structure, appropriate concentration of  perovskite components and heat-treatment condition will play  key roles in improving optical performance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass.  We use a well-designed   $\\mathrm{SiO_{2}{-}B_{2}O_{3}{-}Z n O{-}C a F_{2}}$   glass as the  host to investigate the effect of perovskite concentrations   $(\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}\\mathrm{-PbX}_{2}\\mathrm{-NaX}_{1}$\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
