CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

Integration with Solar Cells  \n\nCombining energy conservation and generation into one device  is a highly attractive scientific undertaking. Smart windows  with both of these properties have been achieved by either integrating SCs with   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  -based thermo chromic layers or relying  on thermo chr mic perovskite materials.  \n\nOne approach utilized the light scattering induced by the   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   nanoparticles.  In this method, the solar cell was  attached to the sides of the   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  -based thermo chromic film,  which consisted of a   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}@\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}@\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   nano particle/poly­ urethane (PU) composite layer between two light guide layers \n\n (LGLs) ( Figure   10 a). The incident light was scattered by the \n\n  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}@\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}@\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   nanoparticles to the adjacent SCs, facilitating  electricity generation (Figure 10a). A  $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   of   $7.5\\%$   accompanied  by a power conversion efficiency of   $0.52\\%$   was achieved.  \n\nAnother approach was to use the light transmitted  through   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  -based thermo chromic film.  Figure  10b represents the layered configuration, which sequentially consisted of   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   thermo chromic film, Ag nanowires (AgNWs),   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , a photo­ active layer, poly(3,4-ethylene di oxy thi oph en e):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), and an indium tin  oxide (ITO) layer. The photo­ active layer is consisted of the  dike to pyr ro lo pyr role–quin que thi oph ene  alternating  copoly­ mer:[6,6]-phenyl $\\cdot C_{60}$  -butyric  acid  methyl  ester  (pDPP5T $2{\\cdot}\\mathrm{PC}_{60}\\mathrm{BM})$  . The   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  -based thermo chromic film was made of   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   nanoparticles and polyvinyl pyr ro li done composite. Distinct layer boundaries were observed using scanning electron  microscopy (SEM; Figure 10c). Compared to the performance  of the scattering-based approach, the power conversion efficiency was significantly improved to   $3.1\\%$  , while maintaining  the same   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   of   $7.5\\%$  . However, the   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$   of both configurations decreased considerably to of   $28.2\\%$  . Further research  efforts are necessary to enhance the energy conservation and  generation performance of integrated smart windows.  \n\nMore recently, Yang and co-workers reported a bi functional  thermo chromic halide perovskite based solar cell.  While the  temperature is low, the device is transparent with low power  output. Whereas, transparency drops significantly while the critical phase transition temperature of   $105~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  is reached. At the  deeply colored state, the device can not only block the solar radiation, but also absorb the solar light and generate electricity with  peak efficiency above   $7\\%$  . Additionally, the device demonstrates  acceptable stability and r ever sibi lit y over the repeated phase transition cycles without color fade or performance degradation.  \n\n# 3.3.

Integration  of electro thermal techniques with thermo responsive materials brings so-called “active control” to temperature-sensitive  smart windows (as well as to other thermo chromic devices).  Recent studies have focused on developing electrically controlled devices by superimposing different transparent electrodes onto the temperature-sensitive layers, which have been  composed of   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  - and hydrogel-based films. The working  mechanism of the electro-thermo chromic system is simple:  joule heating upon an applied voltage to the transparent  electrodes.  \n\nAs a conventional thermo chromic material,   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   crystals  have been investigated in combination with various conductive substrates for electro-thermo chromic devices. The   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$    nanoparticles were deposited on the substrate with transparent  electrodes, such as Ag nanowires or ITO glasses.  When sufficient voltage was applied across the electrode, joule heat was  generated and transferred to the  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   crystals; when the   $\\tau_{c}$   was  reached, solar transmittance variation occurred due to a metal– insulator phase transition. Furthermore, the solar modulation  performance of the electro-thermo chromic system, especially  in the infrared region, could be dynamically manipulated  according to the applied voltage with excellent r ever sibi lit y and  stability. A double-layered   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  -based structure and its fabrication process reported by Li et al. is illustrated in  Figure   11 a.   In the   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}/\\mathrm{Ag}$   NW system, the solar transmittance of the   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   based electro-thermo chromic system in the NIR region  decreased gradually as the applied voltage was increased from  0 to   $6\\,\\mathrm{\\nablaV},$   and a significant drop of transmittance at   $1200\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    from   ${\\approx}70\\%$   to   ${\\approx}30\\%$   was observed as the applied voltage was  further increased to   $6.5\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   (Figure 11b). The solar modulation  performance was also dependent on the thickness of the   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$    nano particle film: thick film resulted in better performance.  Figure  11c,d shows the transmittance hysteresis loop of the   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
