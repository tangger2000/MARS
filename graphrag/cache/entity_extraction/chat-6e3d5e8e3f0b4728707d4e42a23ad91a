CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

As shown  in Figure 4f, a planar PSC with an active area   $(1.0\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   shows  a PCE of   $19.05\\%$     $(18.74\\%)$   measured under reverse (forward)  voltage scan direction. In this case, a phenyl-C61-butyric acid  methyl ester (PCBM) inter facial layer was introduced to fabricate high-performance, hysteresis-free, and large-area PSC  device.  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESLs are also suitable for fabricating  efficient PSCs using other perovskite absorbers, e.g., \n\n  $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  . To reduce hysteresis, PCBM was introduced at \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ESL/perovskite interface to form a   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P C B M}$   bilayer \n\n (Figure S19, Supporting Information). The best-performing  PSC with a   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   active layer achieved a high PCE of   $20.26\\%$     $(19.62\\%)$   measured under reverse (forward) voltage  scan (Figure S15b, Supporting Information). A high SPO of   $19.73\\%$   was obtained (Figure S15c, Supporting Information).  The PSCs using  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESLs without PCBM inter facial layer  exhibited a poorer PCE of   $19.41\\%$     $(17.62\\%)$   measured under  reverse (forward) voltage scan and a SPO of   $18.46\\%$  . The averaged PCEs of both types of devices were extracted from 40 separate cells for each type (Figure S15d, Supporting Information).  The averaged PCEs for the cells with and without PCBM interfacial layer are   $19.21\\pm0.65\\%$   and   $18.40\\pm0.58\\%$  , respectively.  \n\nPSCs are characterized to understand the correlation  between device performance and carrier concentration of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   QD ESLs.  Figure   5 a shows the average series and  shunt resistance (  $R_{s}$   and   $R_{\\mathrm{sh}})$   of the PSCs using   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   QD  ESLs annealed at different temperature. As the temperature  increase, the   $R_{s}$   (  $(R_{\\mathrm{sh}})$   first decreases (increases), reaches a  minimum (maximum) value at the temperature of   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , and  then increases (decreases). For good solar cells, the   $R_{s}$   should  be as small as possible, while the   $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$   should be as large as  possible. Both   $R_{s}$   and   $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$   depend on the carrier concentration  of ESLs. The   $R_{s}$   (  $.R_{\\mathrm{sh}})$   would be too large (small) if the carrier  concentration is too low or too high. The results reveal an  optimal carrier concentration of around   $10^{15}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . Such a carrier density cannot be easily obtained without film break down  for   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   NC ESLs.  \n\nTo further investigate the charge transport dynamic process and interface electronic properties employing   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   QD  and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   NC ESLs, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  measurements. Figure 5b shows TRPL profiles measured from  perovskite absorbers deposited on FTO,   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   QD, and NC  ESL substrates. The TRPL results showed obvious bi-exponential decay behavior. It is seen that the perovskite deposited on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESLs shows the shortest carrier lifetime, indicating  the fastest charge transfer. The perovskite film deposited on  FTO substrate exhibits a mean lifetime of 14.724 ns, while the  per ovsk ites deposited on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD and NC ESLs exhibit mean  carrier lifetimes of, 1.411 and 6.357 ns, respectively (Table S5,  Supporting Information). The EIS measurements show that  the recombination rate is lower at the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESL/perovskite  interface than at   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   NC ESL/perovskite interface films.   Figure 5c shows the Nyquist plots of the devices employing   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   NC ESLs. The semicircles in the low and  high frequency are assigned to be the recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$   and the transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{tr}})$  , respectively. The larger   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   and smaller   $R_{\\mathrm{tr}}$   of the device with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESL demonstrated more efficient charge extraction and suppressed charge  recombination at interface, resulting in improved device performance, which is consistent with our  $J{-}V$  data in Figure 4 and  Figure S8 in the Supporting Information.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/8d8bf0c16b23d7fb4a7b4a5cf1913c0eb8c5784e4c7b12c6577aaaf37da1252f-1723832941.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $J^{-V}$   curves of the best-performing device based on   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   QD ESL measured in different voltage scan  directions. b) The SPO of the device at a constant bias voltage of   $0.95\\;\\lor.$   c) The EQE result for the device. d)  $J^{-V}$   curves of the device measured with  different step delay times. e) The  J – V  curve of the best-performing device based on   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   QDs-coated ITO/PEN substrate.

During the light soaking stability  test, the temperature of the tested device gradually increased to  approximately   $50~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . CsMAFA perovskite was found to exhibit  good moisture stability and photo stability.   Figure   6 a shows   $J{-}V$   curves measured at a   $20\\ \\mathrm{min}$   interval in an ambient condition (humidity  ${\\approx}40\\%$  ). It is worth noting that our PSCs using   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   QD ESLs exhibit good photo stability (detailed results  are shown in Table S6 in the Supporting Information).   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   is  known to exhibit a strong photo catalytic activity for oxidizing  organic materials, resulting in photo catalytic degradation of the  hybrid perovskite under UV illumination.  Several attempts  have been made to address UV-induced stability issue.  We  also expose our PSCs using   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   QD ESLs to UV radiation.  Encouragingly, no obvious degradation of device performance  can be founded after   $2\\textrm{h}$   UV radiation, which may primarily  owing to its very low absorption to UV light photons duo to  its wide band gap energy   $(3.8~\\mathrm{eV}\\approx315~\\mathrm{nm}$  ) of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  QD layer  (Figure 6b).
