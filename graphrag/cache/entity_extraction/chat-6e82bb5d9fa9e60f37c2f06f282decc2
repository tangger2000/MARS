CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

Even under a higher  negative bias of   $-150\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , the dark current density of the asymmetric device is still limited at   $-2.03\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . In contrast, the  dark current density measured from the symmetrical detector  is   $-36.06~\\upmu\\mathrm{A~cm}^{-2}$   under a   $-150\\mathrm{~V~}$   bias (Figure 3i). The statistical result in Table S3 (Supporting Information) shows that  the dark current density measured in symmetric detectors is  about 15 times higher than that of asymmetric detectors under  the same bias of  $-150\\ \\mathrm{V.}$   These results indicate that judiciously  choosing electrode materials with a large difference in work  function can easily construct effective Schottky-junction in the  perovskite devices without the need of any post-processing,  such as annealing and pass iv ation.  \n\nNext, the   $\\mathrm{{Nu}/\\mathrm{{BCP}}/\\mathrm{{C}}_{60}}/$  /FAMACs SC/SpiroTTB/Au structure  detector ( Figure   4 a) was fabricated to assess their detailed X-ray  detection performance. Figure  4b shows the X-ray response  with various dose rates under a bias of   $-20\\,\\mathrm{~V},$   it shows that  the absolute photo current response is sensitive to the X-ray  dose rate. The photo current density versus the dose rate at different biases is plotted in Figure 4c. The photo current density  of the asymmetric detector is much higher than the symmetric  detector. Additionally, the detector shows a clear response even  under   $0\\textrm{V}$   bias due to the built-in electric field in the asymmetrical structure (Figure S9, Supporting Information), which can  be used as a self-powered detector in X-ray detection. For comparison, we also fabricated the symmetrical devices of FAMACs  SC and asymmetrical devices of   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   SCs, and  their dose-rate-dependent net photo current densities under  different biases are shown in Figure  4d–f, respectively. Furthermore, by fitting the slope of the photo current density-dose  rate curves, X-ray sensitivity of the SC detectors under different  biases can be calculated. As shown in Figure  4g, the sensitivity of the asymmetrical FAMACs SC X-ray detector is about   $(3.5\\pm0.2)\\times10^{6}\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at  $-60\\;\\mathrm{V}$   bias, which is 1.7 times  higher than the symmetrical device of about   $(2.1\\pm0.1)\\times10^{6}\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}$     $\\bar{\\mathrm{{Gy}}_{\\mathrm{air}}}^{-1}~\\mathrm{{cm}}^{-2}$  . However, for the   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   SC and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   SC  asymmetric detectors, the sensitivity is only   $(1.5\\pm0.1)\\times10^{5}\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}$     $\\mathrm{{Gy_{air}}^{-1}\\,c m^{-2}}$   and   $(9.0\\pm0.6)\\times10^{3}\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   at the same bias,  respectively. The sensitivity of the FAMACs SC X-ray detector  is much higher than the superior FAMACs thin-film based  X-ray detector with a high sensitivity of  $(97\\pm1)\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\ \\mathrm{Gy}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,   which highlights the brilliant op to electronic properties of highquality FAMACs single crystalline. We also note that the sensitivity of the FAMACs SC X-ray detector is the highest reported  up to date for all perovskite X-ray detectors, for comparison, we  have summarized the sensitivities from different per ovsk ites  (Table S4, Supporting Information).  \n\nThe theoretical sensitivity   $\\left({{S_{0}}}\\right)$   without considering the  photo­ conductive gain of the SC detectors was calculated, as the  detail calculation process provided in the Supporting Information section. According to the calculation, the theoretical sensitivity factors (  $S_{0}$  , the case without gain) of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  ,  and FAMACs detectors are   $1.51\\times10^{3}~\\upmu\\mathrm{C~cm}^{-2}~\\mathrm{G{y}_{a i r}}^{-1};$     $1.53\\ \\times$   $10^{3}\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\;\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{y}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}$  , and   $1.51\\times10^{3}\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\;\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{y_{air}}^{-1}$  , respectively.  Their theoretical sensitivity under the same X-ray is nearly the  same when without considering the photo conductive gain.  However, in case some photo excited electrons are trapped by  some possible shallow defects, surplus holes will have to traverse between the electrodes multiple times before they are  recombined. This would result in even higher photo conductive  gain and hence higher signal current. Therefore, in the specific  devices, the sensitivity of a detector is mainly affected by the carrier mobility, the carrier lifetime, and internal photo conductive  gain induced by the presence of shallow defects.  The gain  factor of the FAMACs SC X-ray detector under different dose  rates and electric fields are calculated in Figure S10 (Supporting  Information). We can see that the gain factor is higher when  under a higher electric field. However, the gain factor gradually decreased with increasing the dose rate. This similar trend  is often observed in photo conductive photodetector s because as  the irradiation intensity increases, the photo generated carriers  tend to gradually fill into shallow traps and therefore reduce  the gain.  Overall, Under the same electric field, the higher  carrier mobility, longer carrier lifetime, and the higher the gain  factor, the higher the sensitivity is. Therefore, it is because of  the much higher carrier mobility   $(288.4\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\:\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\:\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$   and longer  carrier lifetime   $(6.4\\:\\upmu\\mathrm{{s})}$   of the FAMACs SC material than those  of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   SC and   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$   SC that made the FAMACs  SC detector shows much higher sensitivity. Furthermore, the  response time of the FAMACs SC detector under X-ray was  measured, as shown in Figure S11 (Supporting Information).  The rise (from   $10\\%$   to   $90\\%$  ) and fall (from   $90\\%$   to   $10\\%$  ) time  is 2.3 and   $57.2~\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$  s, respectively. We have also summarized the  response time of devices fabricated from per ovsk ites, as listed  in Table S5 (Supporting Information). The response time in  this work is much shorter than other perovskite X-ray detectors  reported in the literature, which further confirmed the high  gain of the FAMACs SC X-ray detectors.  \n\nThe detection limit (the lowest dose rate can be detected) is  another key parameter of X-ray detector. To study the detection  limit of these three perovskite SC devices, we have performed the  I – t  X-ray photo current response measurements under various  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/8019581154c061cbc8b865d89b7937a9be601c3bb8d479da3f406c4be6b9d24f-1723836109.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   Performance of perovskite SC X-ray detectors. a) Schematic illustration of the photoelectric process in the   $\\mathsf{A u/B C P/C}_{60}/\\mathsf{F A M A C s\\ S C}/$  Spi\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
