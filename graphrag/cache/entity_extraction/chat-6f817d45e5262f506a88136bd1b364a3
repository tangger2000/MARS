CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Along with the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   introduced deterioration, the decomposition process of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}/\\$  perovskite system accelerates at elevated  temperatures.  \n\nFurthermore, according to our research, the performance  of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM will gradually degrade under full  spectrum AM 1.5G illuminations for extended exposure time.  This is because   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   shows high photocatalysis activity under  the illumination of ultraviolet (UV) light with wavelength  less than   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   and the simulated sunlight contains about   $4.6~\\mathrm{mW~cm}^{-2}$   of UV light less than   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   in the spectrum.  As a result, under the excitation of UV light,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   will decompose the perovskite materials atop its surface. More seriously,  surface hydroxyl groups and chemical residues on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   surface  will induce photochemical reactions and further accelerate the  decomposition of perovskite.  \n\nIn order to improve the performance of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   based PSCs,  the high recombination loss and chemical instability must be  solved. According to the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) theory,  there are two technical means to reduce the surface recombination: (1) reduce the density of surface states; (2) reduce the  concentration of free electrons and holes at the surface. The  surface state concentration can be reduced by depositing or  growing a suitable material with low surface recombination  velocity on the surface and the concentration of free carriers  can be reduced by doping, which are the two most commonly  used methods.  \n\nSurface pass iv ation is an easy and efficient way to suppress  the surface recombination, and researches have been carried  out by many groups in this area. Son et al.  reported a solution method to fabricate a thin layer of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   on the surface of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods. The surface morphology of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   modified   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanorods is shown in  Figure   7 a. As shown in the figure, the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   surface is uniformly covered by   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  . The   $J{-}V$  curves of  PSCs based on  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETMs with and without   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   modification  are shown in Figure 7b. As expected, the photovoltaic performance especially the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and FF increased by varying degrees,  which indicates that the surface modification is an efficient  method to suppress the surface recombination. Similar results  are also reported by Dong et al.  and Chen et al.  Besides   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  , in 2016, our group modified the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods by an  ultrathin   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   film fabricated by the ALD method. After modification with the   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   film, the PCE of PSC was  improved from   $11.72\\%$   of those without modification to   $16.08\\%$  . Schematic diagram of surface recombination inhibition process is shown in Figure 7c. As shown in the figure, the  trap states originated from defects on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   surfaces capture the  photon generated electrons and holes, which lead to the severe  recombination. The   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   modification suppresses the surface  defects, improves the carrier extraction efficiency, and further  improves the solar cell performance. Moreover, the thickness  of   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   has an important impact on solar cell performance.  The thickness of ALD $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   films is controlled by the number  of ALD cycles. The solar cell performance with different ALD  cycles is shown in Figure 7d. The figure displays that the best  PCE is obtained with two ALD cycles of   $\\mathrm{{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{{O}_{3}}}$   films. This is  because one ALD cycle of the   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   film cannot form a continuous film, while three ALD cycles of   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   film significantly  increase the series resistance. Either a too thin or too thick   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   film decreases the solar cell performance. Except the  inorganic materials, segmented copolymers, like PCBM and  poly(ethylene imine) (PEI),  are also used to modify the  interface of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and perovskite. These materials usually have  a more negative conduction band edge than that of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  . As  a result, once   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   surface is covered by these materials, the  surface recombination sites are passivated and an energy barrier is formed to prevent the photon injected electrons from  approaching the ZnO surface.  For these reasons, the surface  recombination is efficiently suppressed.  \n\nAnother widely used method in improving  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM quality  is intentional doping. Dong et al. fabricated an ultrathin AZO  (Al doped ZnO) film on the surface of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods by spin  coating.  After Al doping, the electrical properties of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  ,  e.g., higher electron mobility, are significantly improved. In  addition, Al doped   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   has higher conduction band than \n\n  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  . As a result, Al doping restrains the recombination at the \n\n  $\\mathrm{ZnO}/\\$  perovskite interface. Mahmood et al. fabricated electron  rich nitrogen doped   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods with a PEI capping layer  on the surface. In their research, the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods were prepared with hydrothermal method. In order to achieve nitrogen  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/3aca167a33d9999d68e707a4304a37ba1376702f3ea13005369fbf5c2060d8a7-1727115071.jpg)  \nFigure 7.  $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  -modified  $Z\\mathsf{n O}$   nanorods. b)  $J^{-V}$   curves of PSCs based on ZnO nanorods with and without  $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   modification. a,b) Reproduced with permission.
