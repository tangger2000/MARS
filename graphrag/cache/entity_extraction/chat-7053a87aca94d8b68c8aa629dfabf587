CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

One can see that the PL spectrum exhibits dual emission  peaks that can be well fitted with a blue emission at   $446\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    and a yellow emission at   $550~\\mathrm{nm}$  , matching well with the PL  spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   materials (Figure 1d), respec- tively. Also, the dual-peak emission feature can be well understood by the excitation spectra comparison of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@$   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites with pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$  . As  shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information, the excitation  spectrum of   $\\mathrm{CsCu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites exhibits a bimodal  characteristic, and the former (latter) peak at  $295~\\mathrm{nm}$     $(325~\\mathrm{nm})$  )  corresponds to the excitation spectrum of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$     $\\left(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}\\right)$    host. Therefore, the overlapped excitation band   $(290{-}320\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  )  could activate the blue and yellow emission components simultaneously, generating the white light. Unlike the conventional  multi-component system, the photon self-absorption phenomenon in   $\\mathrm{CsCu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   composites is negligible due to the  large Stokes shifts of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$     $.228\\;\\mathrm{nm})$  ) and  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$     $(139\\;\\mathrm{nm})$  ).

Note that the observed nanorods  and nanoblocks in the composites were contributed individually from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$  , which are characterized  by distinct morphology features, as shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information. The contents of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cu}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$    in the composites films are estimated to be   ${\\approx}80\\%$   and   ${\\approx}20\\%$    according to the quantitative energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy element analysis and Rietveld refinement of the XRD  data, as seen in Figures S5 and S6; and Table S2, Supporting  Information. Such morphology features can effectively avoid  the color changes of the composites caused by anion exchange  and carriers transfer because two components are individually  existed without the formation of compact structure configuration. To confirm this point, microscopy fluorescence measure- ments at two spots as marked in Figure 2d were conducted. As  shown in Figure 2e, obvious blue (spot A) and yellow emission  (spot B) were observed, corresponding to the intrinsic emission from   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{5}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  , respectively. Figure 2f shows  the time-resolved PL decay spectra measured at two spots.
