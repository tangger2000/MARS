CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

In pristine perovskite, the PB of   $n=3$   phase shows a fast decay  time with   $\\tau_{1}$  of 1.31 ps (Figure 2e). The PB formation time of   $n\\geq4$  phase is 1.63  ps within the timescale of the fast decay  time of   $n=3$   phase, indicating a fast carrier transfer process.  Differently, the PB of   $n=3$   for pristine/ABA per ovsk ites show  a smaller   $\\tau_{1}$   of 0.67 ps (Figure 2f), which is nearly half of that  in pristine perovskite (1.31 ps), implying more efficient carrier  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/b06c40ed03c2f27cee8c00a0fbcfa00906f7779a70e1b43ecba7b06cc6e820af-1723836050.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   Characteristics of trap densities: a) The time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) decay spectra of the pristine and pristine/ABA perovskite  films.

Besides, the higher efficient carrier transfer is verified by  the faster formation time constant (  $'\\tau_{\\mathrm{et}},\\;0.95~\\mathrm{ps})$  ) of   $n\\geq4$   phase  for pristine/ABA per ovsk ites, which is less than that of pristine  per ovsk ites (1.63 ps). Consequently, we observe the fast photogenerated carrier transfer from the low-order phase to the highorder phase in the quasi-2D perovskite, and demonstrate that  pristine/ABA per ovsk ites show more efficient carrier transfer  from   $n=3$   phase to  $n\\geq4$   phase than that of the pristine perovskite, which is vital to obtain highly performed PeLEDs as discussed in the following part.  \n\nBesides the efficient energy transfer in pristine/ABA perovskite films, there is an enhanced PL intensity for pristine/ ABA perovskite films as observed in Figure 2b, consistent with  this trend, a dramatic increase of PLQY from   $45.5\\%$   (pristine)  to   $63.5\\%$   (pristine/ABA) is found (see Figure S7, Supporting  Information), indicating a large reduction of non radiative  recombination. We further performed time-resolved PL (TRPL)  measurements to investigate the effect of ABA on the perovskite film carrier lifetime. The TRPL decay curves are shown  in  Figure    3 a, which can be fitted by a bi exponential function  of  I  $\\mathit{\\Omega}(t)=\\mathit{I}_{0}+\\mathit{a}_{1}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{1})+\\mathit{a}_{2}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{2})$  , where   $a_{1},\\,a_{2}$   are the  amplitudes;   $\\tau_{1},~\\tau_{2}$   represent time constants for fast and slow  decay lifetimes. The fast time constant is related to nonradiative recombination of the traps, and the slow time associates  with the radiative recombination.  The fitted parameters for  TRPL decay curves are extracted in Table S3 (Supporting Information). It is revealed that both the fast and slow decay lifetimes for pristine/ABA perovskite film of 3.62 and 19.63 ns are  much longer than that of pristine perovskite film (  $\\tau_{1},~3.08$   ns  and   $\\tau_{2}$  , 12.82 ns), which promotes the average fluorescence lifetime of pristine/ABA perovskite (  $\\tau_{\\mathrm{av}}=6.10$  ns) 1.5-fold higher  than the pristine perovskite (  $\\tau_{\\mathrm{av}}=3.99$   ns). The PL and TRPL  results show that the incorporation of ABA can effectively passivate trap states and improve the radiative recombination in  the perovskite films, which is consistent with the result of the  metallic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   suppression by ABA incorporation as shown in  Figure 1e. To further verify the effect of ABA on defect density  of perovskite films, the space charge limited current (SCLC)  is performed (Figure  3b,c). The current–voltage   $(J-V)$   curves  of the devices were measured under dark condition with the  structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite  $/\\mathrm{MoO}_{3}/\\mathrm{Ag}$  . The  trap state density of the perovskite film can be calculated by  the equation of   $N=(2V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{r}}\\mathcal{E}_{0})/(e L^{2})$  , where   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is trap-filled  limiting voltage,   $L$   is the thickness of the film,   $e$   represents the  electron charge,   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   are the dielectric constant and the  vacuum permittivity, respectively. Generally, the lower value of   $V_{\\mathrm{TEF}}$   indicates the less concentration of trap states in the films.  In order to determine the trap state density, the value of   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   is  estimated by the equation of   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}=(C L)/(\\varepsilon_{0}S)$  , where the geometrical capacitance of   $C$   can be determined from the   $C{-}V$  curves  (Figure S8, Supporting Information), as reported previously.   As expected, the trap state density for pristine/ABA perovskite  film is notably reduced to  $2.01\\times10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   from   $4.22\\times10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$    (pristine perovskite film), which further confirms the effective  pass iv ation of ABA. Besides, we also extract the trap density of  states ( t DOS) of pristine and pristine/ABA per ovsk ites from  capacitance versus frequency measurement, in which the device  structure of ITO/PVK/perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al was adopted  according to the previous reports.  As shown in Figure 3e,  the pristine/ABA perovskite shows much lower  t DOS that that  of pristine perovskite over the entire energy range, indicating  the less trap density after ABA incorporation, which is in good  agreement with the results of TRPL and SCLC measurements.  \n\nWe have also fabricated the PeLEDs to evaluate their EL performances. The PeLEDs are configured with a structure of ITO/ PVK/perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al, where the perovskite is the emission layer, PVK and TPBi are the hole injection layer (HIL) and  electron injection layer (EIL), respectively. The energy bands  of pristine and pristine/ABA perovskite films were confirmed  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/d5a6d1e9d23049657be206500007b060184d948a863b264c7b11a11568f0d944-1723836048.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   PeLED structure and performance: a) the energy diagram of each layer in PeLEDs, b) the cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  image of PeLEDs, c) density–luminance–voltage   $(J{-}L{-}V)$  , d) efficiency–current density   $(E Q E-J)$  , and e) efficiency–luminance ( EQE – L ) curves. f) Histograms of 20 devices for each pristine and pristine/ABA PeLEDs.
