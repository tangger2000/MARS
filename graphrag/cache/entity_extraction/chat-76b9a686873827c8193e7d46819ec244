CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

The distinctive  physico chemical properties of these species, as well as their complex transport/ kinetical phenomena in a working cell,  constitute the bottleneck of Li–S batteries  for practical applications. Particularly,  the shuttling of soluble LiPSs induces an  internal redox cycle that lowers the Coulombic efficiency, as well as renders drastic  phase migration and redistribution.  This  significantly degrades the capacity, cycling  life, as well as the shelf life ( Figure   1 a). The  effective regulation of LiPSs in a working  Li–S battery is strongly considered.  \n\nLithium-sulfur (Li  S) batteries are strongly considered as the next-generation  rechargeable cells. However, both the shuttle of lithium poly sulfides (LiPSs)  and sluggish kinetics in random deposition of lithium sulfides   $(\\mathsf{L i}_{2}\\mathsf{S})$   significantly degrade the capacity, rate performance, and cycling life of Li  S cells.  Herein, bi functional   $\\mathsf{B a}_{0.5}\\mathsf{S r}_{0.5}\\mathsf{C o}_{0.8}\\mathsf{F e}_{0.2}\\mathsf{O}_{3-\\delta}$  perovskite nanoparticles (PrNPs)  are proposed as a promoter to immobilize LiPSs and guide the deposition  of  ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}$   in a Li  S cell. The oxygen vacancy in PrNPs increases the metal  reactivity to anchor LiPSs, and co-existence of lit hio phil ic (O) and sul fi phil ic  (Sr) sites in PrNP favor the dual-bonding (Li  O and   $\\mathtt{s r-s}$   bonds) to anchor  LiPSs. The high catalytic nature of PrNP facilitates the kinetics of LiPS redox  reaction. The PrNP with intrinsic LiPS affinity serves as nucleation sites for   ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}$   deposition and guides its uniform propagation. Therefore, the bifunctional LiPS promoter in Li  S cell yields high rate performance and ultralow  capacity decay rate of   $\\mathbf{0.062\\%}$   (a quarter of pristine Li  S cells). The proposed  strategy to immobilize LiPSs, promotes the conversion of LiPS, and regulates  deposition of  ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}{\\mathsf{S}}$   by an emerging perovskite promoter and is also expected  to be applied in other energy conversion and storage devices based on multielectron redox reactions.  \n\nA diverse set of strategies has been  proposed to regulate the transport and  kinetical behaviors of LiPSs through the  introduction of nano structured cathodes,   protected anodes,  targeted binders,   and functional separators.  The intro  \n\nDeveloping better battery technologies that exert conversion  electrochemistry represents great promise to advanced portable  electronics and electric vehicles. Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery,  which possesses an ultrahigh energy density of 2600 Wh  $\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$  ,  has been regarded as one of the most promising next-generation rechargeable devices to meet the increasing demand  for high energy/power density, long cycle life, and enhanced  safety.  The high energy density of Li–S batteries is endowed  \n\nduction of metal oxides or sulfides (M–O/S) with chemisorptive and conductive surfaces is applied to regulate LiPSs.   Lithium bond has been well established through polar–polar  interactions between LiPSs and lit hio phil ic surface. Such material/configuration design and mechanistic understanding are  fruitful to inspire the exploration of novel sulfur hosts capable  of simultaneously regulating LiPS crossover and   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   deposition, whereas a few such investigations are available. Integration of multimetal component in one crystal is highly expected  to tune LiPS transport and regulate   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   deposition  since it  potentially combines individual component functions.  \n\nIn this contribution,   $\\mathrm{Ba}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.8}\\mathrm{Fe}_{0.2}\\mathrm{O}_{3-\\delta}$  perovskite nanoparticles   $\\left(\\mathrm{Pr}\\mathrm{NPS}\\right)$   were proposed as a promoter to immobilize  LiPSs and guide   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   deposition in a working Li–S battery.  The structure of the PrNP possesses a cubic crystal, with Co  and Fe ions coordinated by six oxygen ions whereas Ba and   $\\mathrm{Sr}$  ions coordinated by twelve oxygen ions (Figure 1c).  The  reason we select PrNP to anchor LiPSs is rooted to several  attributes. Firstly, compared with simple metal oxides, PrNPembraced abundant oxygen vacancies can enhance the surface  interactions between LiPSs and PrNPs. Secondly, the ultrafine   $\\mathrm{PrNPS}$   are able to expose abundant active sites (O and Sr sites)  to anchor LiPSs. Thirdly, PrNPs introduce variable- and highvalence transition metal ions (Fe and Co ions) that further  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/ba7ffd21b4b3e579618f16730ec4d0802453ccced5f02c0b888be14c6e9371af-1723832805.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}S$   regulation in a working Li–S battery. a) LiPSs diffuse out of cathode owing to  the inferior inter facial affinity of CNTs, inducing the shuttle of LiPSs between electrodes in a working cell. b) LiPS immobilization and   ${\\mathsf{L i}}_{2}S$   nucleation  on perovskite (PrNP) promoter.

Asobtained PrNPs exhibit a well-defined perovskite-type crystallinity, corresponding to an index of PDF#20-1027 ( Figure   2 a).
