Introduction  \n\nDespite remarkable progress in hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the  concern of toxic lead ions remains a major hurdle in the path towards PSC’s  commercialization; tin (Sn)-based PSCs outperform the reported Pb-free  per ovsk ites in terms of photovoltaic performance. However, it is of a particularly great challenge to develop effective pass iv ation strategies to suppress  Sn(II) induced defect densities and oxidation for attaining high-performance  all-inorganic  $\\mathsf{c s s n l}_{3}$   PSCs. Herein, a facile yet effective thioamides passivation strategy to modulate defect state density at surfaces and grain boundaries in   $\\mathsf{c s s n l}_{3}$   per ovsk ites is reported. The th io semi carb azide (TSC) with   $\\scriptstyle{\\pmb{S}}={\\pmb{C}}-{\\pmb{N}}$   functional groups can make strong coordination interaction with  charge defects, leading to enhanced electron cloud density around defects  and increased vacancy formation energies. Importantly, the surface passivation can reduce the deep level trap state defect density originated from undercoordinated  $\\mathsf{s n}^{2+}$   ion and  $\\mathsf{s n}^{2+}$   oxidation, significantly restraining non radiative  recombination and elongating the carrier lifetime of TSC treated  $\\mathsf{c s s n l}_{3}$   PSCs.  The surface passivated all-inorganic  $\\mathsf{c s s n l}_{3}$   PSCs based on an inverted configuration delivers a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of   $\\mathbf{8.20\\%}$  ,  with a prolonged lifetime over  $\\mathbf{90\\%}$   of initial PCE, after  $\\mathbf{500\\,h}$   of continuous  illumination. The present strategy sheds light on surface defect pass iv ation  for achieving highly efficient all-inorganic lead-free Sn-based PSCs.  \n\nOrganic–inorganic hybrid lead halide  perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged  as a ground-breaking photovoltaic technology due to their extraordinary photovoltaic performance and low-cost solution/ vapor  process ability.   Despite  the  remarkable progress in hybrid PSCs, the  concern of toxic lead ions remains a major  hurdle in the path towards   $\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{s}^{\\prime}$   commercia liz ation.  As the most promising  alternative, Sn-based per ovsk ites outperform all of the currently reported   $\\mathrm{Pb}$  -free  per ovsk ites in terms of photovoltaic performance.  In an   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  -based perovskite  material system, the all-inorganic   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$    with native inorganic structural stability,  favorable direct bandgap   $(1.3\\ \\mathrm{eV})$  , extralow exciton binding energy   $(18\\ \\mathrm{meV})$  , and  excellent optical absorption coefficient   $(10^{4}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   comparable to that of   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbI_{3}}$  ,  is the most investigated   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  -based semiconductor material for photovoltaic applications.  However, compared with hybrid   ${\\mathrm{Mdown}}_{3}$   and   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   PSCs of a significant  leap in PCE over   $10\\%$  , the potential appli  \n\ncation of all-inorganic  ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   PSCs seriously suffered from the  limitation of a low PCE of only around  $5\\%$  .  \n\n$\\mathrm{{sn}(I I)}$   induced defects are the main obstacle to achieve highly  efficient   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  -based PSCs.  Specifically, the   $\\mathrm{{sn}(I I)}$   induced  defects are generated from two ways: i) the low defect-tolerance  resulting in high-density Sn-vacancies; ii) the facile oxidation  of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$  causing self-doping effects.  On the basis of these  origins, the possible defects formed at the surface and in the  interior of the perovskite crystal grains are shown in  Figure   1 a.  For   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   perovskite, the interior Sn vacancy defects do not  introduce deep level traps inside the band gap, while tend to  induce highly   $p$  -type doping characteristics.   ] Previous  studies have demonstrated that providing an Sn-rich condition  with tin halides   $(\\mathrm{SnX}_{2})$   in addition is an effective strategy for  suppressing the formation of interior vacancies.  Different  from the interior defects, the Sn vacancies and under coord inated   $\\mathrm{Sn}$   ions at the surface of perovskite crystal grains can  induce deep level traps which are major non-radiative recombination centers, having a considerable influence on the opencircuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   and PCE.  Additionally, the unsaturated  Sn dangling bonds are susceptible to the adsorption of a variety  of nucleophilic molecules (e.g., oxygen molecules) that readily  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/a2ef6ceb4f761198f346b0e65bf6b0b4832b5c5fa4857998adeca42f3fce5467-1727101024.jpg)  \nFigure   1.   a) Schematic illustrating defects formed at the surface and in the interior of a   ${\\mathsf{C s S n l}}_{3}$   perovskite and its corresponding pass iv ation strategy,  including i) surface and interior Sn vacancy, ii) under coordinated Sn ions, iii) proposed reaction pathway of superoxide production under photo ex c it ation, iv,v) Lewis acid-base interaction between TSC and   ${\\mathsf{C s S n l}}_{3}$  , and the resistance of oxidation. b) Schematic illustration of the passivator assisting  sequential vapor deposition (PASVD) method for fabricating  $\\mathsf{C s S n l}_{3}$   perovskite films. c) DFT calculated binding energies of four additives on  $\\mathsf{S n l}_{2}$   terminated perovskite surface. d) XRD full width at half maximum (FWHM) and PL intensity of  ${\\mathsf{C s S n l}}_{3}$   perovskite films under the effect of different additives.  \n\nform dative bonds with the perovskite surface.  Numerous  studies revealed that, when per ovsk ites are photo excited, the  surface-localized excitons or carriers would transfer to the  adsorbed oxygen molecules, turning them into superoxide   $(\\mathrm{O}_{2}{}^{-})$  that triggers perovskite oxidation and formation of deep level  traps.  Therefore, effective pass iv ation approaches at surface deep trap states are imperative to boost the photovoltaic  performance and further prolong the operational lifespan of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   PSCs.  \n\nHere, we combine the synergistic advantage of vapor deposition and surface pass iv ation for fabricating high-grade   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   perovskite film with low deep trap state densities. It  is revealed that the surface strategy using TSC with   $\\scriptstyle S=C-\\mathrm{N}$    functional group could have strong electrostatic attraction  and coordination interaction with charge defects, leading to  enhanced electron cloud density around defects and increased  vacancy formation energies. Importantly, the surface passivation could reduce the deep level trap state density originated from under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   ion and   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   oxidation,  restraining the non radiative recombination and elongating  the carrier lifetime of TSC treated  ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   perovskite. The surface passivated all-inorganic   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{nI}}_{3}$   PSCs with an inverted  configuration delivers a champion PCE of   $8.20\\%$  , together  with a prolonged lifetime over   $\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
