CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

To prove the interaction between   $\\mathrm{8A^{-}}$   group  and   $\\mathsf{C s P b}(\\mathrm{Br}/\\mathsf{C l})_{3}$   perovskite, we firstly conducted the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement  as shown in Figure 1d. For pure BAP sample, the vibrational  bands of   $\\mathrm{COO^{-}}$   groups are located around 1597 and   $1549\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  ,  while they shift to lower wave numbers of 1592 and   $1527~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$    upon mixing with   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  . Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on pristine  and BAP-modified perovskite films. In comparison, the XPS  spectra from the core levels of Pb 4f shifts to higher binding  energy with the modification of BAP (Figure  1e). The simultaneous shifts in FTIR and XPS spectra synergistic ally can be  attributed to the coordinating interaction between Pb cations  and   $\\mathrm{8A^{-}}$  anions through the   $\\mathrm{CO^{-}}$  groups sharing a lone  electron pair with the empty 6p orbital of under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atoms.  Apart from that, an apparent XPS spectral shift  is also observed for the core levels of   $\\operatorname{Br}\\,3\\mathrm{d}$   and Cl 2p, which  provides the direct evidence for the interaction between   $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$   and  halide ions (Figure 1f).  \n\nBased on the above findings, we further investigate the  influence of BAP-modification on the crystalline, morphological, and photo physical properties of perovskite films. The  X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pristine and BAPmodified perovskite films are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting  Information). It’s observed that both the perovskite films  present apparent diffraction peaks at   $15.1^{\\circ},\\ 21.5^{\\circ}$  , and   $30.7^{\\circ}$  ,  corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) crystal facets in  cubic crystal. The identical diffraction peak locations indicate  that both   $\\mathrm{8A^{-}}$   and   $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$   can not occupy the perovskite lattice  sites. By comparison, the incorporation of BAP-modification  only leads to slightly reduced diffraction intensities. As displayed in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), adding BAP  into perovskite precursor solution does not change its contact angle on the normal hole transport layers applied in our  work. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force  microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to examine  the morphological transition of perovskite films (Figures S3  and S4, Supporting Information). It is noted that the BAPmodification induces an obvious influence on the film surface  roughness, by which the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) roughness  is decreased from 2.2 to   $0.3\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . Besides, the SEM images  demonstrate that the pristine perovskite film is assembled by  nonuniform crystals with low film coverage, while the BAPmodified film presents compact grains without pinholes. The  distinct film morphology not only confirms the ability of BAP  in improving perovskite crystallization, but also validates the  interaction between BAP and   $\\mathsf{C s P b}(\\mathrm{Br}/\\mathsf{C l})_{3}$   perovskite from  another side.  \n\nTo gain the insights into the photo physical impact of BAPmodification on perovskite films, we firstly collected the -UV– vis absorption curves as plotted in  Figure    2 a. Evidently, both  pristine and BAP-modified perovskite films show almost the  same absorption characteristic, demonstrating that doping BAP  does not vary the RD phase distribution in perovskite films.  It’s noted that there are no observable absorption peaks from  low-n phases   $(n<3)$  , where n refers to the number of layers  in RD perovskite structures. Such phenomenon can be attributed to the moderate concentration of organic spacer in perovskite precursor. The concentrated n-phase distribution   $(\\mathrm{n}\\geq3$  )  is favorable for achieving efficient radiative recombination and  minimized exciton energy loss. The Tauc plot analysis depicted  by the inset in Figure  2a shows the negligible change in the  optical bandgap of perovskite film. As displayed in Figure 2b,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/0ef784e1a5cf52355f47a75d64eeaaba178fdd7ae477f850bb0511ebca5ef9e2-1727106012.jpg)  \nFigure   1.   Dual-pass iv ation of mixed-halide sky-blue perovskite film. a) Schematic preparation process of the perovskite film with BAP additive.  b) Electrostatic potential (ESP) configuration of the Lewis-base group of BAP. c) Schematic of the BAP-induced pass iv ation on the under-coordinated  lead atoms in per ovsk ites. d) FTIR spectra of pure BAP and BAP/  $\\mathsf{T b B r}_{2}$   mixture. e,f) XPS spectra of e) Pb 4f, f) Cl 2p and Br 3d core levels from the  pristine and BAP-modified perovskite films.  \n\nBAP-modification significantly boosts the photo luminescence  (PL) intensity of perovskite film, which can be also visually confirmed by the photograph in the inset. The slight variation in  the PL peak positions keeps well consistent with the UV–vis  absorption spectra. To elucidate the immediate factor of the PL  enhancement by BAP-modification, time-resolved PL (TRPL)  measurement was conducted to study the exciton dynamics  in perovskite films (Figure  2c). The TRPL curves were fitted  by means of tri-exponential decay functions, and the fitting  parameters are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The increase of the calculated average lifetime   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}})$   from  14.6 to 21.0 ns enabled by BAP-modification demonstrates the  suppression of the trap-mediated non radiative recombination  loss. Consequently, a remarkable photo luminescence quantum  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/7d5ba992260dc3c07800e706b0d6c151d11300553dd2299b133c08741662fb16-1727105980.jpg)  \nFigure   2.   Property characterizations of perovskite films and devices. a) Absorption spectra.

The inset is the equivalent circuit model.  \n\nyield (PLQY) improvement of perovskite films from   $35.2\\%$   to   $72.1\\%$   was achieved with BAP-modification as shown in the  inset of Figure 2c. To further verify the reduced trap states in  the BAP-modified perovskite film, the space charge limited  current (SCLC) method was performed (Figure  2d).
