CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Inorganic   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   and   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   were respectively used as the HTM  and ETM to replace the conventionally used PEDOT:PSS and  PCBM. The  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  layer was prepared from a Ni precursor solution composed of ethylene glycol and   $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{NO}_{3})_{2}\\!\\cdot\\!6\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  . The  precursor solution was spin coated on ITO and annealed to  form  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$   film. The  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film was prepared by similar method  reported by Liu and Kelly,  but in order to prevent perovskite  film from being damaged,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nano particle was dispersed in  chl oro benzene instead of methanol mixed solution. The solar  cell with metal oxide charge transport materials gained a PCE  of   $16.1\\%$  , and more importantly, compared with solar cells  using organic HTMs and ETMs, the stability of all metal oxide  solar cells was significantly improved: the PSCs with   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x}$  and   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   maintained   $90\\%$   performance over   $60\\textup{d}$   of testing in  ambient air at room temperature and with   $30–50\\%$   humidity,  however the performance of PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS and  PCBM dropped dramatically.  \n\nSince the PCE and long term stability of PSCs have made  great progress, the extensive production of PSCs has become  another area worth studying. While the most widely used  method to fabricate PSCs is spin coating, which is not suitable  for mass production, hence, the effective and low cost roll-toroll method is a good alternative. However, roll-to-roll method  can be carried out only with the process temperature within   $100{-}150\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.$  .  For widely used   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   ETM, both planar and  mesoporous films need high temperature   $(450~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   annealing.  Although low temperature   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   fabrication processes have  been reported,  the performance of PSCs based on low  temperature   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   is still not comparable with that based on  high temperature   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  . As for PEDOT:PSS and PCBM, the process temperature is no longer a limit, but the low stability of  PSCs cannot be ignored.  As a result, high quality   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanoparticle films with low process temperature are good choice for  now.  \n\nHwang et al. reported the fabrication of fully slot-die-coated  PSCs.  In this research, they fabricated fully printable PSCs,  with exception of metal electrodes, which were evaporated, by  the slot-die coating method with a home-made 3D printer. A  schematic diagram of the printer is shown in  Figure   5 a. In this  3D printer system, the space position and motion of nozzle can  be controlled by predefined programs. Temperature of the substrate and nozzle are also controlled. By using this equipment,  the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM, doped poly(3-hex yl thi oph ene) (P3HT) HTM,  and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   film were successfully fabricated. To improve the  crystallization of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   film, the   $\\Nu_{2}$   quenching and hot  slot-die was used; the improved quality of the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   film promotes the reaction conversion reaction of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   to perovskite.  As shown in Figure 5b,   $\\Nu_{2}$   quenching is used to quickly dry  the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   film by a   $\\Nu_{2}$   flow, which leads to a porous   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   film  and makes methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) easy to permeate.  The hot slot die process involves heating the substrate to a set  temperature to facilitate the reaction and the temperature of  substrate is important to the film quality and solar cell performance. The morphology of a perovskite film obtained under a  substrate temperature of   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is shown in Figure 5c and the  PCEs of solar cells based on perovskite films obtained from different substrate temperatures are shown in Figure 5d. The best  PCE of   $11.96\\%$   was obtained from devices fabricated by slot-die  coating when substrate temperature is  $70~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in ambient. These  results verify the possibility of the roll to roll method in low  cost PSCs production.  \n\nAs for flexible PSCs, the mechanical strength of cells is  another problem worth considering. To improve the mechanical strength of flexible devices and simplify the structure,  Zhou et al. report a hole-conductor-free and metal-electrodefree solar cell structure, which is   $\\mathrm{ZnO}_{I}$  perovskite/carbon solar  cell structure.  By using this unique structure, they gained a  PCE of   $8.73\\%$   on a grid substrate and   $4.29\\%$   on a flexible sub- strate. Their devices can maintain   $80\\%$   of its initial efficiency  even after 1000 times of bending.  \n\n# 4.

Electron transport becomes less efficient when the photocurrent increases because of the serious surface recombination.  This limits the further increase of solar cell efficiency. As a  result, in order to reduce the severe recombination, 1D   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nano structures were used to replace nano particle films. Unlike  nanoparticles, the 1D ZnO nano structure usually is single  crystal and provides a direct pathway for electron transport. Among various 1D structures, ZnO nanorods is the most  widely used material for solar cells.  \n\nA traditional method of fabricating   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods is hydrothermal method. The hydrothermal method is a synthesis  method of crystal materials in hot water or organic solvents  under high temperature. The basic principle of hydrothermal  method for   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   synthesis is as follows. A Zn salt and alkali,  e.g., KOH or hex a methylene tetra mine, are dissolved into the  solvent.
