CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

J – V  characteristics were recorded in the dark by  a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit. The electron mobilities were  extracted by fitting the  $J^{-V}$   curves according to the reported method.   Work function measurements were performed in air by SKPM with an  atomic force microscope (AFM) (Agilent SPM 5500) equipped with a  MAC III controller (three lock-in amplifiers) using a Pt/Ir-coated Si tip  (FMG01/Pt, NT-MDT). A single-pass mode with amplitude modulation  was employed and a Lock-in 1 amplifier was used to drive the cantilever  to get topographic images. Lock-in 2 provided an AC tip bias, and a DC  bias was also provided by an internal servo mechanism to counter the  electrostatic force on the tip for SKPM measurement. Contact potential  differences (CPDs) were recorded, which correlated with the work  functions of the tip and sample by the formula  $\\mathsf{V_{C P D}}=(\\Phi_{\\mathsf{t i p}}-\\Phi_{\\mathsf{s a m p l e}})/e$  .  Then the absolute work functions of the samples were estimated after  calibration of the work function of the tip by using a highly oriented  pyrolytic graphite sample in ambient conditions as a reference.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors acknowledge the financial support from the Ministry of  Science and Technology of China (2017 Y FA 0207302 and 2015 CB 932303)  and the National Nature Science Foundation of China (21731005,  21420102001, and 21390390).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\nelectron-transport layer, hysteresis-free, interface engineering, perovskite  solar cells, ZnO  \n\nReceived: September 26, 2017 Revised: November 24, 2017 Published online: January 19, 2018  \n\n[1]\t A.  Kojima, K.  Teshima, Y.  Shirai, T.  Miyasaka,  J.
