CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The absolute PLQY was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog system  equipped with a single grating and a Quanta-Phil integration sphere  coupled to the Fluorolog system. The PL delay was measured on a timecorrelated single-photo counting (TCSPC) spec tro flu oro meter (FLS920,  Edinburg Instrument, UK) at room temperature. The EL spectra,   $L\\mathrm{-}J\\mathrm{-}V$    characteristics and EQE were collected by using a Keithley 2400 source,  a fibre integration sphere, and a PMA-12 spectrometer for light output  measurements in a glove box filled with   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   and at room temperature  (the measurements equipment was designed by Hamamatsu Photonics  Co., Ltd.).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was financially supported by the National Key Research and  Development Program of China (2016 Y FB 0401701), NSFC (Grant  Nos. 61604074, 51572128, 51672132, and 61725402), the Natural Science  Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20160827), China Postdoctoral  Science Foundation (2016 M 590455), the Fundamental Research Funds  for the Central Universities (Grant Nos. 30917011202, 30915012205, and  30916015106), and PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\nelectroluminescence, light-emitting diodes, per ovsk ites, quantum dots,  surface ligands  \n\nReceived: February 3, 2018 Revised: April 22, 2018 Published online:  \n\n[1]\t Y. Shang, Z. Ning,  Natl. Sci. Rev.   2017 ,  4 , 170.\n\n [2]\t Y. X. Yang, Y. Zheng, W. R. Cao, A. Titov, J. Hyvonen, J. R. Manders,  J. G. Xue, P. H. Holloway, L. Qian,  Nat. Photonics   2015 ,  9 , 259.\n\n [3]\t Y. Shirasaki, G. J. Supran, M. G. Bawendi, V. Bulovic,  Nat. Photonics   2013 ,  7 , 13.\n\n [4]\t X.  W.  Gong, Z.  Y.  Yang, G.  Walters, R.  Comin, Z.  J.  Ning,  E. Beauregard, V. Adinolfi, O. Voznyy, E. H. Sargent,  Nat. Photonics   2016 ,  10 , 253.\n\n [5]\t B.  S.  Mashford, M.  Stevenson, Z.  Popovic, C.  Hamilton,  Z.  Q.  Zhou, C.  Breen, J.  Steckel, V.  Bulovic, M.  Bawendi,  S. Coe-Sullivan, P. T. Kazlas,  Nat. Photonics   2013 ,  7 , 407.\n\n [6]\t V. Colvin, M. Schlamp, A. P. Alivisatos,  Nature   1994 ,  370 , 354.\n\n [7]\t L.  Wang, J.  Lin, Y.  Hu, X.  Guo, Y.  Lv, Z.  Tang, J.  Zhao, Y.  Fan,  N. Zhang, Y. Wang,  ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces   2017 ,  9 , 38755.\n\n [8]\t Y. T. Zou, M. Y. Ban, W. Cui, Q. Huang, C. Wu, J. W. Liu, H. H. Wu,  T. Song, B. Q. Sun,  Adv. Funct. Mater.   2017 ,  27 , 1603325.\n\n [9]\t X.  L.  Dai, Z.  X.  Zhang, Y.  Z.  Jin, Y.  Niu, H.  J.  Cao, X.  Y.  Liang,  L. W. Chen, J. P. Wang, X. G. Peng,  Nature   2014 ,  515 , 96.\n\n [10]\t H. C. Wang, S. Y. Lin, A. C. Tang, B. P. Singh, H. C. Tong, C. Y. Chen,  Y. C. Lee, T. L. Tsai, R. S. Liu,  Angew. Chem., Int. Ed.   2016 ,  55 , 7924.\n\n [11]\t J. Lim, M. Park, W. K. Bae, D. Lee, S. Lee, C. Lee, K. Char,  ACS Nano   2013 ,  7 , 9019.\n\n [12]\t J.-H. Kim, H. Yang,  Chem. Mater.   2016 ,  28 , 6329.\n\n [13]\t M. A. Green, A. Ho-Baillie, H. J. Snaith,  Nat. Photonics   2014 ,  8 , 506.\n\n [14]\t J.  You, L.  Meng, T.-B.  Song, T.-F.  Guo, Y.  M.  Yang, W.-H.  Chang,  Z. Hong, H. Chen, H. Zhou, Q. Chen,  Nat. Nano techno l.   2016 ,  11 ,  75.  \n\n[15]\t E.  M.  Sanehira, A.  R.\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
