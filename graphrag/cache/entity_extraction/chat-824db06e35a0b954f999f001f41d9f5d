CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The  strongly localized 1D electronic structure in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC is  key to self-trapped excitons with high radiation recombination  rate, resulting in a high PLQY of IWE. In Raman spectrum  (Figure  4d), vibrational intensity of phonon modes (corresponding to I–Cu–I vibration) shows an obvious reduction at   $80\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{K}},$   indicating that a strong electron–phonon couple agrees  with the self-trapped exciton effect.  \n\nIn conclusion, with the method of anti solvent infiltration,  all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$  -free   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC was synthesized for the first  time. In   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC, the  $\\mathrm{Cu-I}$   octahedron isolated by Cs atoms  forms a spatial 1D chain structure. According to first-principle  calculation, the   $\\mathrm{Cu-I}$   octahedron contributes most electron  states and Cs gives far less. This electron configuration of  1D chain structure makes electrons have strong localization.  At the same time, electrons and holes tend to form excitons  due to Coulombic effect. Due to electron reconfiguration,  the formed self-trapped excitons in the Cu–I octahedron are  recombined and emit a broad-spectrum IWE. Benefitting from  strongly localized electronic structure, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC has a  high PLQY   $(>\\!15\\%)$  , which is comparable to the current best  organic–inorganic lead halides. Using Cs (alkali metal atoms)  in the crystal structure to build a spatial metal halides chain  with 1D localized electron structure has a great prospect in  producing the stable and efficient all-inorganic white light– emitting materials.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials Preparation : Cesium iodide (CsI,   $99.9\\%)$  ), cuprous (I) iodide   $(99.9\\%)$  , DMF   $(\\mathsf{A R99\\%})$  ), DMSO   $(\\mathsf{A R99\\%})$  , and methanol (anhydrous)  were used. Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents and solvents were  used without further purification.  \n\n$C s C u_{2}I_{3}$   SCs Synthesis : The synthesis of 1D   $\\mathsf{C s C u}_{2}\\vert_{3}$   SC was  based on infiltrating inverse solvent recrystallization method. In the  synthesis,   $5\\,\\times\\,10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\bar{~}M~C s l}$     $(1.299~\\mathrm{g})$   and   $5\\,\\times\\,10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{~M~}\\,{\\sf C u l}$   (0.952 g) were  dissolved in   $\\mathsf{D M F}\\!:\\!\\mathsf{D M S O}\\,=\\,4\\!:\\!7$  (typical   $4~\\mathsf{m L}$   DMF and 1  mL DMSO)  and stirred for   $^\\mathrm{~4~h~}$   at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . After complete dissolution, the mixture  was dripped with methanol solution until white precipitate appeared  and stopped dissolving. The saturated solution was filtered with a  polytetrafluoroethylene   $(0.45\\ \\mathsf{u m})$   syringe, and the filtered solution  was injected into vials and sealed with a paraffin film with small holes.  The vial was placed in a beaker containing methanol, which was also  sealed with paraffin film to form an airtight anti solvent atmosphere  (methanol). Growing for   $48~\\mathsf{h}$   in a   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  , high-quality SC with a size of  about  $10\\:\\mathsf{m m}\\times\\mathsf{I.5}$   mm was obtained.  \n\nCrystal Structure Characterization : SCXRD test was taken on an  Agilent diffract o meter. XPREP was used to obtain an indication of the  space group and the structure was typically solved by direct methods  and refined by SHELXTL. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were  obtained by Bruker diffract o meter, a TEM (FEI; Tecnai G2 F30 and   $300~\\mathrm{kV})$  ) equipped with HRTEM.  \n\nSpectrum Measurement : Excitation spectra were collected by using an  Edinburgh FLS1000 spec tro flu oro meter at room temperature. Reflection  spectra were obtained by a Shimadzu UV2600 with external integrating  sphere. The crystal was grounded into powder for testing. PL intensity  dependence on excitation power density data was carried out on a   $325\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   laser PL measurement system with Neutral Density Filter Kits  (THORLABS) and optical power meter of Ophir (NOVA II header and  PD300-UV probe). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was tested by using  a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 instrument.  \n\nTemperature-Dependence Photo luminescence : The sample was kept  in a thermostat modifying low temperature with liquid nitrogen.  The emission spectra were collected by spectrophotometer with  photomultiplier tube detection system. Excitation light source was a  He-Ne   $325\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   laser, and the temperature was changed by automatic  tuning temperature controller (Linkon) from 80 to   $450~\\mathsf{K}_{r}$   increasing  $\\daleth0~\\mathsf{K}$  with per spectrum recorded.  \n\nTime-Resolved PL (TRPL) Measurement : TRPL data were collected at  room temperature by using the Edinburgh FLS1000 spec tro flu oro meter.  The average lifetime was obtained from the double-exponential decays  according to Equation (2)  \n\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathsf{a v g}}=\\sum_{i}A\\tau_{i}^{2},i=1,2\n$$  \n\nwhere  $\\tau$  is the decay time of PL intensity and  $A_{i}$  is the amplitude of each  component.  \n\nDFT Calculation : The band structure of   $\\mathsf{C s C u}_{2}\\vert_{3}$   SC was calculated with  VASP software. A plane-wave basis set with   $400~\\mathrm{eV}$   cutoff was used to  expand electronic wave functions, and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional  was adopted as pseudo potentials. Structure relaxation was performed  until all forces were smaller than   $0.001\\ \\mathrm{eV}\\ \\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}^{-1}$  . Relaxation of electron will  be stopped if the free energy change between two steps is smaller than   $10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{eV}.$   A   $k\\cdot$  -mesh of   $3\\times3\\times3$   was used for structure relaxation, and a  high-density  $k$   points  $9\\times9\\times9$   were used for self-consistent calculation.  \n\nData Availability : The data that support the findings of this study are  available from the corresponding author on request.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nFinancial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of  China (grant no. 61604178, 91333207, U1505252, and 91833301) and  the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (no. 2018 M 643305).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\n1D localization, all-inorganic per ovsk ites, excitonic recombination, lead  free, white lighting  \n\nReceived: August 6, 2019 Revised: August 25, 2019 Published online:  \n\n[1]\t E.
