OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The PBSCF  NTs were prepared by electro spinning following the same procedure as  described in previous work.  \n\nElectrochemical Measurements : The OER performance of PBSCF  before and after thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction was  tested by a standard three-electrode system, with the PBSCF thin film  electrodes or the PBSCF powder/NT on carbon paper as the working  electrode, a  $\\mathsf{A g}/\\mathsf{A g C I}$   electrode as reference electrode, and a Pt wire as  the counter electrode (with details in the Supporting Information).  \n\nCharacterization of the Catalysts : Surface morphology of PBSCF thin  film was observed by SEM (SU-8010, Japan) and atomic force microscopy  (MFP-3D-S, USA). The surface chemistry was characterized by XPS using  Thermo Scientific instrument (ESCALAB 250Xi) with mono chromate d Al  K α  (15 kV) X-ray radiation equipped with charge neutralization. The C 1s  peak at   $284.6~\\mathsf{e V}$   was used as the internal reference peak for calibrating  binding energies.
