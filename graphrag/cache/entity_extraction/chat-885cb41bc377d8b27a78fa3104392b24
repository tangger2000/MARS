CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The deposition of  the uniform PMMA layer on the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs film strongly  improves the quality of the next-stage-grown pentacene film.  \n\nThe UV–visible absorption spectra of pentacene,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$  PMMA, and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}/$  /pentacene are depicted in  Figure 1h. The pentacene film exhibits strong absorption at 630  and   $680\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   while the absorption peak of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}$   is  mainly located in the UV region   $\\approx\\!500$   nm. The charge-transfer  efficiency was investigated by the steady-state photo lu minescence (PL).  As shown in Figure 1i, with excited by   $400\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  photo signal,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}$   film and the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMMA}/$  pentacene film both emit sharp emission peak which is centered at   $515~\\mathrm{nm}$  . However, with the combination of pentacene  and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$  , the PL intensity becomes weaker or  even quenching which is originated from the radiative transfer  between the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   and pentacene, indicating highly  effective splitting of excitons has been achieved.  \n\nPL decay dynamics are fitted with the double-exponential  function to obtain fluorescent lifetime parameters.  According  to the mean lifetime calculation equation   $\\tau\\,=\\,{\\Sigma_{i}A_{\\mathrm{i}}\\tau_{\\mathrm{i2}}}/{\\Sigma_{i}A_{\\mathrm{i}}\\tau_{\\mathrm{i}}},$  where  $\\tau_{\\mathrm{i}}$   is lifetime constant and   $A_{\\mathrm{i}}$   is the corresponding weight  factor. The fast and slow components of PL lifetime, which are  related to the non radiative and radiative recombination, respectively,  can be extracted as   $\\tau_{1}=2.27$   ns and   $\\tau_{2}=8.23$   ns, and   $\\tau_{1}=1.41$   ns and   $\\tau_{2}=5.16$   ns for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   layer and  CsPbBr 3 /PMMA/pentacene film.  The longer lifetime of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   is consistent with its stronger fluorescence  intensity. The fast exciton separation at the interface between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   hybrid film and pentacene matrix is related  to the shorter lifetime of excitons at the interface between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}/\\mathrm{PMM}$   and pentacene.  \n\nThe output curves of the field effect transistor (FET) based  flash memory measured under the dark condition and with  light illumination are illustrated in  Figure   2 a.  Both the gate  voltage and the incident light can be utilized to modulate the  transport of charge carriers in the semiconducting channel.  The linear and saturation regions clearly prove the typical  p-type behavior of the transistor. The output curves appear linearly under the low bias as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting  Information), which indicates good ohmic contact between the  pentacene and the Au source–drain electrodes.  The extracted  field-effect mobility and on/off ratio of the device in the dark  condition are calculated to be   $0.24~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   and  ${\\approx}1.86\\times10^{5}$  ,  implying the satisfied crystalline quality of the thermally evaporated pentacene film. Compared with the   $I_{\\mathrm{DS}}$   measured in the  dark,   $I_{\\mathrm{DS}}$   achieved under light illumination shows an abrupt  increment.  The influences of the light intensities are further  studied as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), in  which more noticeable enhancement of the current can be  observed with stronger light stimulation.  Figure 2b displays  the photo programmable and electrical-erasable characteristics  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs-based flash memory device. Light pulse with a  wavelength of   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  , intensity of   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~cm}^{-2}$  , and width  of   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   was employed as programming operation while the electrical pulse with height of  $-50\\;\\mathrm{V}$   and width of 1 s was utilized as  erasing operation. The transfer curves are substantially shifted  toward the positive direction after light programming operation, suggesting the electrons trapping in the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
