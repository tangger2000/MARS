CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the  PENG at different temperatures from 20 to  $220~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is examined,  which show that the output of the PENG decreases slightly  with the change of temperature. The density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the PENG  retains beyond   $79.16\\%$   ( Figure   7 a) of its original value after  being heated at   $220~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $^{1\\textrm{h}}$  , proving its applicability over a  very large temperature range. However, since the low melting  point of PET, PI tape, and PMMA, when the temperature is  higher than   $250~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the device will soften and deform. The  performance of device will be significantly attenuated. So the  various flexible materials with high temperature resistance as  packaging materials will be discussed in the future work.  \n\nThe PENGs after assembly were immersed in water, sulfuric  acid solution, and sodium hydroxide solution respectively. After  different time, the PENG was taken out, rinsed with water and  dried at   $50~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for  $3\\:\\mathrm{{h}}$  . Then the output of device was tested. The  PENG is immersed into the water with the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   being  monitored periodically (Figure   $7\\mathsf{b}$  ). After the PENG immersed  in water for one day, one month, and half a year, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   is stable with almost   $100\\%$   of its original value remaining.  After submerging in sulfuric acid solution for 1 and   $25\\textrm{h}$  , the  density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   remains above 160 and   $108\\,\\,\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{A\\,\\,cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, keeping above   $94.12\\%$   and   $63.53\\%$   of its original value  (Figure  7c). After soaking in sodium hydroxide solution for  1 and   $25\\,\\textrm{h}$  , the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   was measured to be 155 and   $140\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, remaining above   $91.18\\%$   and   $82.35\\%$  of its original value (Figure 7d). The inset of Figure 6b–d provides the digital photographs recorded from one sample of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers by immersing it in water/ sulfuric acid solution/sodium hydroxide solution, respectively,  suggesting that it can still be excited under 365 UV light  after immersing into solution with different time, further  confirming the high stability against the water and acid–base.  Interestingly, according to the test results, our PENG keeps a  superb stability against harsh environments, such as thermal,  water, acid, and alkali. Of course, this result can also be  extended to common acid–base solutions, such as hydrochloric  acid and potassium hydroxide, which further broadens the  application range of the PENG.  \n\nThe stability mechanism of the device under harsh environment can be mainly attributed to the following points: i) The  high stability of PVDF: PVDF possesses high thermal stability (decomposition temperature of   $350~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  ) and good chemical resistance (acid and base).  ii) Enhancement effect of in  situ growth method: First, the stability of composite fibers is  enhanced by the high interaction strength between   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    NCs and PVDF due to high surface energy of NCs   $[20\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  .   Second, compared with films, since the composite fibers possess small diameter of about   $400\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , which is beneficial to discharge of air, the composite fibers is very dense and without  pores (Figure  2). Therefore the stability of composite fiber is  significantly enhanced, including thermal and water st abilities,  which is also verified by Liao et al.  iii) The protection of the  encapsulation layer of the device: All of the encapsulation layers  of device including PI tape, PMMA, and PET, possess high  thermal stability and good chemical resistance, which prevent  the device from being damaged in harsh environment.  \n\nWhen the force generator moves up and down at a frequency  of   $1~\\mathrm{Hz}$  , the output voltage of the PENG under pressure conditions can be observed. To demonstrate a practical application scenarios,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers based PENG  with an effective area of   $0.80~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   is used to charge a   $3.30~\\upmu\\mathrm{F}$    capacitor, where the output signal is rectified by a full-wave  bridge rectifier circuit, as shown in Figure  $7\\mathrm{e}$   and its inset. The  capacitor can be gradually recharged to a voltage of up to   $2\\mathrm{~V~}$    monitored by the electrometer, convincingly demonstrating  the PENG has a significant practical application potential. As  shown in Figure  $7\\mathrm{f}$  and its inset, a man stepping on the PENG  can produce a reliable output of up to   $110~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . And the  PENG was fixed on a glove and driven by the bending motions  of finger. As shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information,  the PENG reveals a density of short-circuit current of about   $60~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . These suggest promising application potentials of  the PENG for motion sensors.  \n\nTable   1  summarizes the key parameters of various hybrid  composite materials PENGs ever reported. In this work, the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$    of   $103\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   is comparable to the state-of-the-art hybrid composite  materials PENG. Notably, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$    composite fibers based PENG approaches   $170~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , which  is 4.86 times larger than the best one reported in literature for  lead halide per ovsk ites composite PENGs.  Most importantly,  the PENG in this work exhibits a superb stability under harsh  environments, such as large temperature range, water, acid,  and alkali compared to the best one ever reported for hybrid  composite PENGs (Table 1).  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nGenerally, a high-performance PENG based on  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  PVDF  composite fibers is fabricated. The   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs encapsulated in the PVDF matrix possessing the average size of about   $20~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   in diameter are spatially distributed in the fibers body  uniformly, which enables to enhance the output signal of the  PENG. The PENG can possess better performance under the  condition of the ratio of PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   to be 2, electro spinning time of   $1~\\mathrm{min}$  , polarization voltage of   $5\\mathrm{\\kV}$   and in situ  growth method.
