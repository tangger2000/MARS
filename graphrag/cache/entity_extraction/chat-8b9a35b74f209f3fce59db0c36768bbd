CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Compared with   $\\mathrm{p{\\cdot}T i_{3}C_{2}T_{x}},$   TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  shows a novel peak at   $532.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   of –ON, which is derived from  the electrostatic interaction between   $_\\mathrm{N}$   atoms of TBAB and  surface O-terminals of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   (Figure  2b).  As shown in  Figure  2c, TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   shows extra N 1s peak from TBAB.  The N 1s peak with core level at   $401.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   is corresponding to  the adsorbed   $_\\mathrm{N}$   atoms, further evidencing the attachment of  TBAB on  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   surface, and the N 1s peak at   $399.9\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   should  be derived from the  $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$   bond of TBAB.

TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   shows a significantly reduced WF of   $3.9\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  , which may be originated from charge transfer and/or  interface dipole between TBAB and  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  .

The  electron transfer from TBAB to   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   can decrease the WF  of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   and increase electrical conductivity of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  . Density functional theory (DFT) calculation is performed to investigate the effects of the TBAB attachment on the WF of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  The   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   is   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}$   MXene terminated by   $\\mathrm{T_{x}}$  groups, and the  compositions of the   $\\mathrm{T_{x}}$  groups are reasonably assumed to be   $81.25\\%$   of oxygen,   $12.5\\%$   of hydroxyl, and   $6.25\\%$   of fluorine  in the DFT calculation.
