CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

The declined   $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$   may result from the improved resistance between SNO  nanosheets due to tiny cracks formed during the bending test.  In addition, we investigated the variation of photo detecting  performance after certain cycles of repeated bending test,  with the illustration of one bending cycle shown in Figure S13  (Supporting Information). As is shown in Figure  5g,h, the   $I_{\\mathrm{p}}$   and   $R$   show a rapid declination in the first 100 cycles and  subsequently level off before a sudden drop after around  900 cycles. According to the optical images in Figure S14  (Supporting Information), the evolution of performance is  closely related to the initiation and propagation of cracks in  SNO sheet film, and after hundreds of bending cycles, those  cracks eventually lead to device failure. Considering the  simple, additive-free, drop-coating fabrication process of  the flexible PD, the performance in bending tests is quite satisfactory and could be further improved in future study. In  brief, the successful fabrication of SNO flexible PDs shows  the potential of forming SNO sheet–based film on other flexible substrates by other practical solution-based methods,  such as spin coating, spraying, and self-assembly, toward further enhanced performance in future study.  \n\nIn summary, 2D perovskite SNO nanosheets with thicknesses down to   $1.8\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   are synthesized via liquid ex folia tion  of precursor CSNO prepared by a two-step high-temperature  solid state reaction. XRD and TEM results suggest high crystallinity of prepared SNO nanosheets. The room-temperature  PL and TRPL spectra reveal complicated radiative recombination mechanisms in SNO nanosheets. By fabricating UV  PDs based on individual few-layer SNO sheets, it is found  that exfoliated SNO nanosheets exhibit outstanding performance, including an excellent narrowband resp on siv it y over  1200 A   $\\mathbb{W}^{-1}$  , an EQE of   $5.6\\times10^{5}\\%$  , a detect iv it y of   $1.4\\times10^{14}$    Jones (7L SNO,  $270\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  , 1 V bias), as well as fast response speed  (  $t_{\\mathrm{rise}}\\approx0.4$   ms,   $t_{\\mathrm{decay}}\\approx40~\\mathrm{ms}$  ), outperforming most of reported  2D material–based UV PDs. More intriguingly, SNO sheets  with greater thicknesses show a higher value of photo current  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/ee0aef37974d9c4f3feac9a2b9ab3eacbb60bf4294e6f0c9282999dd10e7351e-1723834930.jpg)  \nFigure 5.   Photo detecting performance of flexible PDs based on SNO nanosheet film. a) The optical image of a flexible SNO PD on PET substrate.  b) The  $I{-}V$  curves of a flexible SNO PD in dark and under UV illumination. c) The  $R_{\\lambda}$   (orange line) and EQE (green line) at  $\\rceil\\vee$   bias. d) The illustration  of the bending test. e) The  $I{-}t$   curves under   $300\\;\\mathsf{n m}\\;\\mathsf{U V}$   switching   $(0.39\\ m\\mathrm{\\dot{W}}\\ c m^{-2})$  ) at   $\\rceil\\vee$   bias, measured at various bending angles. f) The variation  of   $R_{\\lambda}$   and on/off ratio with the bending angle. g) The   $I{-}t$  curves under   $300\\ {\\mathsf{n m}}\\ {\\mathsf{U V}}$   switching at   $\\rceil\\vee$   bias, measured after every 100 bending cycles.  h) The variation of   $R_{\\lambda}$   and on/off ratio with increasing bending cycles.  \n\nand photo resp on siv it y under UV illumination, indicating the  thickness dependence of SNO photo detecting performance.  The high photo detecting performance of SNO nanosheets lies  in their high crystal lin it y during high-temperature synthesis,  and defects formed during the fabrication process contribute  to the high photo conductive gain. Furthermore, in SNO transistors, the field-effect mobility of SNO sheets with various  thicknesses are extracted, and the carrier transport properties  of SNO sheets could be easily modulated by applying a gate  voltage. Under UV illumination, photo generated electron–hole  pairs outnumber thermionic and tunneling carriers, resulting  in a greatly improved photo current in SNO photo transistors.  By conducting low-temperature mobility tests, we deduced  that phonon scattering and impurity scattering coexist in SNO  sheets. In addition, flexible and transparent PDs based on SNO  nanosheet film via an easy and low-cost drop-coating process  show satisfactory resp on siv it y and can keep their performance  in repeated bending tests. This work not only suggests the  high performance of 2D perovskite SNO PDs, but also sheds  light on the development of high-performance op to electronics  based on stable low-dimensional wide-bandgap per ovsk ites in  the future.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis of   $S r_{2}N b_{3}O_{10}$  Nanosheets : The synthesis process was carried  out as previously reported with modification.

After that,   $5\\ \\mathsf{m o l\\%}$   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   was added into the calcinated product and ground thoroughly  before second calcination at   $1350~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\mathsf{\\Omega}_{\\mathsf{I}0}\\mathsf{\\ h}$   in air. For each step, the  excess amount of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   compensated for its loss at high temperature.  After calcination,   $\\mathsf{C s^{+}}$   was replaced with   $\\mathsf{H}^{+}$   by slowly stirring   $0.5\\mathrm{~g~}$   of  obtained powder with  $20\\;{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of  $2\\ {\\mathsf{M}}\\ {\\mathsf{H C I}}$   for 4 days during which acid was  renewed daily. The powder was then washed thoroughly with distilled  water and dried at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   in air, and   $0.2\\;\\mathrm{g}$  of HSNO powder was dispersed  in   $50\\ \\mathrm{\\textmu}$   of aqueous solution containing an equimolar amount of  TBAOH (prepared from   $25\\%$   aqueous solution). The SNO nanosheets  were prepared by shaking the TBAOH-containing solution under  room temperature for 10 days, then washed three times with distilled  water and collected by cent ri fuga tion. Before any characterization and  measurement, (TBA)SNO sheets were dispersed on substrates and then  kept under UV exposure to burn out residual  ${\\mathsf{T}}{\\mathsf{B}}{\\mathsf{A}}^{+}$  .  \n\nCharacterization of SNO Samples : The size and morphology of  exfoliated SNO nanosheets were investigated by field-emission SEM  (Zeiss Sigma). The AFM measurement was conducted on a Bruker  Dimension Edge atomic force microscope. High-resolution morphology  and structure of SNO nanosheets were characterized by TEM (JOEL JEM210\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
