CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

In this work, the imaging measurement  is a conceptual demonstration for the present FAMACs SC  materials for X-ray imaging applications. To achieve commercial products, the X-ray detectors are often integrated to linear  detector arrays or large flat panel arrays for fast and high-resolution X-ray imaging. We believe that the perovskite SC X-ray  imaging system will be able to obtain higher resolution and  faster imaging in the future after the X-ray has been well collimated, smaller size detector pixels are prepared and integrated  them onto readout circuity.  \n\nBy incorporating smaller cations and anions into the   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  perovskite, the stress in the structure is reduced and vacancy  defects are significantly decreased. As a result, the formed  inch-sized triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite single crystals (FAMACs SCs) exhibit high ion migration activation  energy, ultra-low trap density, long carrier lifetime and diffusion length, large charge mobility, and excellent uniformity.  These superior properties were utilized for constructing sensitive X-ray detectors that show stable X-ray response and  the highest sensitivity among all perovskite devices reported  to date. Finally, the FAMACs SC detectors can be integrated  into a detector array with uniform X-ray response and realized  high-contrast X-ray imaging. It is expected that the effective  triple-cation mixed halide strategy and the availability of these  inch-sized high-quality SCs will inspire next-generation X-ray  imaging systems.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/5b4d963b1f8af253342ec2ed33ed4d2bcf0146da17f6dddddfbe2ac3049a3648-1723836112.jpg)  \nFigure   6.   X-ray imaging of the FAMACs SC detectors. a) Schematic illustration of X-ray imaging measurement of the FAMACs SC X-ray detector.  b,c) An open and closed black plastic box with two steel objects inside. d,e) The corresponding X-ray images of the closed black plastic box measured  from the FAMACs SC X-ray detector freshly prepared and after 60 days of storing.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nDetail experiments and methods are provided in the Supporting  Information.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was funded by the National Key Research and Development  Program of China (2017YFA0204800/2016YFA0202403), the program  of China Scholarship Council (CSC NO. 201906870044), the National  Natural Science Foundation of China (91733301/61704098/61604091),  the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  (XD A 17040506), the DNL Cooperation Fund CAS (DNL180311), the 111  Project (B14041), and the Changjiang Scholar and Innovative Research  Team (IRT_14R33).
