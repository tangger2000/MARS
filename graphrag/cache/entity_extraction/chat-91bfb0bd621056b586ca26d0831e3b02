CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals coated with zirconium oxide, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>Synthesis method<|>Modified method used to obtain CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsBr<|>Reagent<|>Cesium bromide, a source of cesium ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbBr2<|>Reagent<|>Lead bromide, a source of lead ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve CsBr and PbBr2, abbreviated as DMF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OAm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Intermediate product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals formed before ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>Precursor<|>Zirconium butoxide, precursor for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZrO2<|>Coating material<|>Zirconium oxide, used to coat CsPbBr3 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Room temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the synthesis was carried out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.4 mmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of PbBr2 and CsBr used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of DMF used to dissolve PbBr2 and CsBr)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.2 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OAm used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.6 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OA used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1500 rpm<|>Reaction condition<|>Speed of vigorous stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10s<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>60 µmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 used for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8500 rpm<|>Purification condition<|>Speed of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 min<|>Purification condition<|>Duration of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The modified super saturated recrystallization method is used to synthesize CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsBr<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>CsBr is a source of cesium ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbBr2<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>PbBr2 is a source of lead ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CsBr<|>DMF is used to dissolve CsBr<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbBr2<|>DMF is used to dissolve PbBr2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OA acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OAm acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Toluene acts as an antisolvent to induce the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>ZrO2<|>Zr(OC4H9)4 is the precursor for ZrO2 coating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZrO2<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>ZrO2 forms a coating on CsPbBr3 NCs to create CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Room temperature<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs is carried out at room temperature<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm is used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Centrifugation at 8500 rpm is used to purify CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: 500\\,000\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   (white), respectively.

Insets of the corresponding PL photographs  of the working LED devices at  $3\\;\\forall.$   EQE and luminance versus driving current for d) green LED, e) red LED, and f) white LED.  \n\neven at high operating currents. For instance, the luminance of  wLED still reaches as high as 400 000 cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   at a high current  of   $300~\\mathrm{mA}$  , which ensures its practical application in LCD as  back-lighting source.  \n\nFor concept demonstration, we have assembled a backlighting source by embedding   $36\\mathrm{\\Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based wLEDs  on the two sides of light guiding plate (LGP) ( Figure   6 a–d).  The main function of LGP is to guide the spot white light from  wLEDs to the plane white light. Indeed, PL spectrum recorded  from LPG shows blue/green/red tri-color narrowband emissions (Figure 6e), and high-brightness and uniform plane white  light is clearly observable under the driving voltage/current of   $12\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   per 2A (Figure  6f). A demo display device was successfully designed by combining a commercial TFT-LCD panel  with the present   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based wLED arrays in the LGP  (Figure  6g; Figure S7, Supporting Information). As demonstrated in Figure 6h, an image with a logo of “Fujian Normal  University” and white background is converted via single-chip  micyoco and integrated circuit, and finally is displayed in the  screen. We detected radiance PL intensities of specifically  selected six positions in the LCD screen with the help of a luminance meter. Evidently, blue/green/red tri-color spectral profiles are similar (Figure S8, Supporting Information) and the  radiance intensities are almost the same for all these positions  (Figure 6i), confirming color and brightness uniformity of the  display device. Furthermore, we directly recorded the brightness value every other day for 9 days and took photos of the  display. No obvious variation in radiance and image is found  (Figure S9, Supporting Information), evidencing excellent stability for the prototype display device.  \n\nFinally, we compare the present prototype LCD device  with a commercial LCD (ZT0007, Shenzhen Kaiyixing Electronics Co., LTD) to confirm its wide-color-gamut feature.  The backlight source of commercial LCD consists of blue  LED chips and YAG: Ce phosphors, which produces a combined white light originated from blue emission of LED  and a broadband yellow emission of   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$  : 4f–4f transition  (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The images of two  kinds of LCD devices based on the commercial backlit unit  and the present   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{X}}_{3}@$  glass backlit unit are presented in  Figure    $\\mathrm{7a-d}$  . Compared to traditional YAG:Ce-wLED backlight, the displays adopting   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}@$  glass-wLED backlight  exhibit more details of object colors. For instance, for the  display of green color image, the commercial one yields a  yellowish green color (Figure  7a), while the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glassbased one presents a pure green color and a more remarkable  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/cd295b32e23f7871907614ee2207668c2170f3e2d20723703c0d76e5c72c19ed-1727105232.jpg)  \nFigure   6.   Photographs of a,b)   $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\emptyset$  glass-based wLED array and c,d) LGP coupled with two wLED arrays. e) PL spectrum and f) luminescent  photo­ graph of LGP under a operating voltage of 12 V. g) Schematic structure of the  $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\emptyset$  glass-based back-lighting LCD system. h) Photograph of  the designed   $\\mathsf{C s P b X3@}$  glass backlit LCD in operation and i) radiance PL intensities from six different detecting positions in LCD screen.  \n\ncolor rendition (Figure  7c). Similarly, display image with  a pure red color and a high saturation is easily realized  for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based LCD (Figure  7d). We directly  measured radiance PL spectra for the pure white, blue,  and green images in the two LCD screens via a luminance  meter. The recorded spectra have been filtered by the color  filters (Figure S11, Supporting Information) and blue/green/ red images show concomitant weak PL bands of other colors  besides dominant emissive profiles (Figure  7e). Evidently,  the fwhm values for both green and red emissions (  $(26~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  ,   $33~\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ) from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based LCD are far narrower than those (  $69\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ,   $54~\\mathrm{nm}$  ) from the commercial one  (Figure  7e). As a consequence, according to the calculated  CIE color coordinates (Table S7, Supporting Information), the  color gamut of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based LCD reaches as high  as   $127\\%$   of NTSC standard and   $176\\%$   of that of the commercial one (Figure 7f).  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, we have successfully prepared   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass with  tunable emitting wavelength, high PLQY , and excellent stability by  modulating perovskite concentration in glass and heat-treatment  temperature. The best PLQYs of green   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  glass and  red   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{I}_{1.5}@;$  glass can reach   $94\\%$   and   $78\\%$  , respectively,  which are the highest values for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   embedded glasses  reported so far. Due to the effective protection of robust glass,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/569cfc63f69491ededfa2aa81f0babe82e8014b459306970abf7d69fdedc3de9-1727105283.jpg)  \nFigure   7.   Display images for LCD screens with a,b) commercial YAG: Ce-converted wLED backlit unit and c,d)  $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\emptyset$  glass-based wLED backlit unit.  e) PL radiance spectra directly recorded from commercial LCD screen and   $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\textcircled{Q}$  glass-based LCD screen via a luminance meter for pure white,  blue, green, and red images. f) Color gamut of  $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\emptyset$  glass-based backlit unit (red solid triangle), commercial backlit unit (blue dot triangle) and  NSTC 1953 standard (black dash triangle).  \n\n$\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   can withstand a variety of harsh stability tests.
