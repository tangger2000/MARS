CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

High-resolution X-ray  diffraction measurement was taken using X’Pert MRD, with Cu K α 1  line operated at with   $V=40~\\mathrm{kV}$   and   $I=20$    mA. UV–vis absorbance  spectrum was measured at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer  Lambda 950 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer in the reflection mode  with an integrating sphere attachment operating in the   $300{-}700\\ \\mathsf{n m}$    region. A highly refined barium sulfate   $({\\mathsf{B a S O}}_{4})$   plate was used as  the reference (  $100\\%$   reflectance). The steady-state and time-resolved  photo luminescence measurements of   $\\mathsf{M A P b B r}_{3}$   single crystals were  performed using a PicoQuant FT-300. Photo luminescence mapping  measurement of   $\\mathsf{M A P b B r}_{3}$   single crystals was performed using a  PicoQuant FT-100. The dark   $I{-}V$  curve was recorded using Keithley  2400 and used to calculate the trap density by Equation (1). The  thickness of   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{P b B r}_{3}$   single crystals was measured by the  digital Vernier caliper. Contact angle measurements were contacted  on a DSA100 instrument. The photo response characteristics for  the devices were collected by using an optical chopper to generate  pulse light illumination, a Keithley 2400 source meter to record the  photo current response under various bias voltage and a series of  LED light illumination. The fast speed response characteristics of  the devices were measured by an optical chopper and a Tektronix  MDO 3104 Mixed Domain Oscilloscope. Besides, the irradiation  was achieved by using a   $532\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   semiconductor laser. The spectral  photo response measurements were performed with a 300 W Xe lamp  equipped with a manual monochromator. A set of optical power meter  (VEGA OPHIR PD300-UV) was used to measure the incident powers.
