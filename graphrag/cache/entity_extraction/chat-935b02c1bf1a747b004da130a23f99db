CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The  properties of the former were more pronounced due to the larger  structural de stabilization according to the measured wavelengthdependent (from 620 to   $720~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  ) nonlinear refraction and 2PA  by performing Z-scan measurements (Figure 5D).  \n\nThe NLO properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   per ovsk ites are highly  dependent on their morphology. Broadband NLO studies performed on  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   films of nanocubes and nanorods using the  Z-scan technique revealed large 2PA cross sections   $(\\approx\\!10^{5}$   GM)  by fitting the open-aperture Z-scan data. Strong third-order  NLO susceptibility   $(\\approx\\!10^{-10}$   esu) was observed in these films.  At higher peak intensities, a switching of the sign in the real  and imaginary parts of the NLO susceptibility was observed  from studies on these   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   nano crystals. The obtained NLO  coefficients clearly suggest that these materials are promising  for ultrafast photonic applications.  For   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   nanosheets,  Jiang et al. found that their linear and nonlinear optical properties can be finely tuned by their thickness (Figure 5F).  The  PL intensity increased nearly three times with the thickness of  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   nanosheet changing from   ${\\approx}104.6$   to   ${\\approx}195.4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  under the same excitation condition. Meanwhile, the saturation  intensity   $\\left(I_{\\mathrm{sat}}\\right)$   could be changed from 3.12 to   $4.79~\\mathrm{GW}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,  while the modulation depth can be altered from 18.6 to   $32.3\\%$  .  The 2PA coefficient   $(\\beta)$   was inversely proportional to the thickness (decreases from 10.94 to  $4.73\\;\\mathrm{cm}\\;\\mathrm{GW}^{-1})$  ).  \n\nThe NLO properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   per ovsk ites are highly anisotropic in their single crystal form. Jang and co-workers  observed highly polarization-selective 3PA in a Bridgmangrown single crystal of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  .  From the strong PL excited  by the 3PA at   $1200\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , they deduced a large 3PA coefficient   $\\gamma=\\,0.14\\,\\pm\\,0.03\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\,\\,\\mathrm{GW}^{-2}$   when the polarization of the picosecond-pulsed fundamental was orthogonal to the   $(-1\\ \\ 1\\ \\ 0)$  direction of the crystal. This 3PA excited FL vanished completely when the polarization was tuned to be parallel to the   $(-1\\nobreakspace1\\nobreakspace0)$   direction. The NLO responses from   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   single  crystals have also been taken by the researchers to probe the  intriguing “above-bandgap emission,”  namely, the FL  excited over an energy level lying above the conduction-band  minimum.  By detailed wavelength-dependent measurements, the authors determined the absolute nonlinear optical  dispersion over the 3PA–2PA crossover region. They found  that the band-to-band transition across the fundamental gap   $(E_{\\mathrm{g}},~2.25~\\mathrm{eV},$  , determined by absorption measurement) is twophoton forbidden, but the three-photon above-bandgap PL at   $2.35~\\mathrm{eV}$   that lies above the fundamental gap is active with a 3PA  coefficient   $\\gamma\\!=0.16\\pm0.04~\\mathrm{cm}^{3}~\\mathrm{GW}^{-2}$   (excited at   $\\lambda=1064~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  ).  This unusual 3PA persisted up to the optical gap   $E_{\\mathrm{op}}$  , which  is the bandgap determined by PL measurements. The highly  efficient MPA-induced PL responses of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   single crystals  with sharp on/off ratios by active polarization control promise  potential application in nonlinear photonic devices.  \n\nPerovskite QDs attract significant interest in recent years  because of their unique optical properties, such as tunable wavelength, narrow emission, and high photo luminescence quantum  efficiency.  The excitonic PL excited by 2PA of perovskite   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs has been found to be highly dependent on the  temperature (Figure  5E,G,H).  The 2PA coefficient is up to   $0.085\\;\\mathrm{cm}\\;\\mathrm{GW}^{-1}$   at room temperature. The energy of the PL peak  increases linearly below  $220\\;\\mathrm{K}$   and approaches a roughly constant  value at  $220{-}380~\\mathrm{K}$  . The occurrence of structural phase transition  from ortho rhombi c to tetragonal leads to a small blueshift of the  PL peak at temperatures higher than   $340~\\mathrm{K}$  . Overall, the change  of the PL peak is less than   $1~\\mathrm{nm}$   from 220 to   $380\\ \\mathrm{K}.$   Moreover,  a temperature-independent chromatic it y was observed at higher  temperature and the PL peak approached a roughly constant  value up to   $380\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{K}}.$   Recently, Chen et  al. further developed an  all-optical switching from designed   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   QDs-based and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$  nanosheets-based per ovsk ites.  They investigated  the light–matter interaction in the visible band and verified the  power dependence of the nonlinear refractive index. By taking  advantages of its optical non linearity, they demonstrated a perovskite QD based all-optical switching. Furthermore, simultaneous  six-photon absorption (6PA) along with lasing was realized in  inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Cl}}_{3}$   perovskite micro crystals.  These findings grant inorganic per ovsk ites more diverse nonlinear optical  potential and higher-order multi photon fluorescent applications.  \n\n# 4.

The  field of halide perovskite based NLO materials, although is still  in its infancy, has gained an increasing amount of attention  because of the opportunities it may bring about for the realization of various technically important applications, such as  up conversion lasing, bioimaging, THz generation, all-optical  switching, broadband saturable absorbers, etc. When the more  mature purely inorganic per ovsk ites hold the merits of robust  air-stability and higher laser\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
