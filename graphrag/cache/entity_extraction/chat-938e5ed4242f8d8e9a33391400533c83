CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Moreover, we find A site alloying at the surface lattice of  perovskite thin film lead to the inter facial configuration mimic  to the “bone-joint,” which provides a cushioning effect on  external stresses during thermal cycling tests.  \n\nThe perovskite films were fabricated from the precursor with  the composition of   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.15}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.15})_{3}$   in a solvent mixture of   $N,N$  -dimethyl form amide (DMF) and dimethyl s ulf oxide  (DMSO).  Consequently, iso prop an ol (IPA) with or without  oct yl ammonium iodide (OAI) and PEAI were spin coated on  the surface of the films. The films were abbreviated as reference without ammonium salt post treatment, and those with  OAI or PEAI treatment as O-5, O-10, O-20, and P-5, P-10, and  P-20 regarding various concentrations of solution (5, 10, and   $20\\times10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M})$   used during post treatment, respectively. The fabrication process was shown schematically in  Figure   1 a. The scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) images of the device configuration  are shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.  \n\nWe recently demonstrate that the inter facial strains at the  perovskite thin film play an important role to govern the carrier dynamics.  Here, we investigate the effects of A-site cations on inter facial stress by employing depth-resolved grazing  incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) technique with   $2\\theta{\\sin}^{2}\\varphi$  method.  The basic idea is to fix the 2 θ  and vary the instrument tilt angles, while maintaining a constant X-ray penetration depth. We consider the perovskite films as quasi-isotropic,  so all the discussions below are based on quasi-isotropic plane  stress state. By fitting the  $2\\theta$  as a function of   $\\sin^{2}\\!\\varphi$   we can calculate perovskite film stress, and the slope of the fitting line  stands for the residual strain. (Figure S2 and Table S1, Supporting Information) The (012) plane was chosen due to its  high multiplicity, which is generally adopted to acquire more  grain information and alleviate orientation effect on the linear  relationship of   $2\\theta{\\sin}^{2}\\varphi$  in the GIXRD measurement.  \n\nWe studied three typical depths: the   $50~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   region near the  surface where the post treatment mainly impacts, the   $200~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  region that near the center of the perovskite films, and the   $500\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   region close to the substrate. Figure  1b–d shows the  GIXRD of the reference with respect to the (012) crystal plane.  By varying   $\\varPsi$  from   $10^{\\circ}$   to   $50^{\\circ}$  , the scattering peaks gradually  shifted to left, indicating the increasing of crystal plane distance   $d_{(012)}$  . It clearly shows that the film is bearing tension  stress as a whole. For different depths, the scattering peaks  show offsets in different degrees, indicative of the inhomogeneous residual stress distribution across the film thickness  direction. By linear fitting of   $2\\theta$  and   $\\sin^{2}\\!\\varphi$  (Figure 1e), we can  estimate the residual stress in depths of 50, 200, and  $500\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   to  be   $77.7\\pm5.4$  ,   $17.9\\pm3.8$  , and   $8.0\\pm3.2~\\mathrm{MPa}$  , respectively. Interestingly, the residual stress in the top region of the perovskite  film was remarkably higher than those at the other depths of  the perovskite film. Higher residual stress in the surface region  means the perovskite crystals bear more serious lattice distortion that creates more defects and traps at the interfaces. To  reduce the surface residual stress is proven to be beneficial for  defect reduction as our previous findings.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/da574ce21ea3a08d60db9f276f615da34969758421f8c9432c143a6980485bd2-1727127072.jpg)  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/8948f2b762891c861371b0d1bf37d49f2374d56d3e5127d7715e58c0ca31f24c-1727127156.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  $\\psi$  values (hollow circles, the measured XRD patterns; solid lines, the fitted results with Gauss function) in the depth of 50, 200, and  $500\\;\\mathsf{n m}$  , respectively.  e) Linear fit of   $2\\theta{\\sin\\!\\theta}^{2}\\varphi$  in the depth of 50, 200, and  $500\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  .  \n\nIn order to release the high residual stress at the surface, we  employed two kinds of A-site cations with different rigidity: OAI  and PEAI.  Table   1  shows the slopes of linear fit of   $\\scriptstyle2\\theta\\cdot\\sin^{2}\\varphi$  in  the depth of 50, 200, 500 nm for the perovskite films with different concentration of OAI and PEAI post treatment, and the  relevant GIXRD measurement results are shown in Figure S3  in the Supporting Information. The residual stresses are  listed in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. After treatment, the residual stress at the surface significantly changed.  For OAI treatment, the residual stress decreased from 77.7 to  about   $45\\;\\mathrm{\\textmu}$   substantially in the surface regions, which is   $60\\%$   of the original stress.

It is possibly due to the formation  of the 2D perovskite layer on top and slight  variation of surface morphology.  Further, the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra were obtained and Tauc plots  analysis (Figure S4, Supporting Information)  \n\nwere carried to investigate the changes in the bandgap   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   after  A-site cation alloying. The band gap of reference and samples  with OAI, PEAI post treatment are calculated, which remain  the same after treatment.  \n\nand bottom of the films were released slightly as well. It is reasonable since the post treatment occurred at the surface where  most ammonium salts are in contact with perovskite films,  which is in accord with previous reports.  Additionally,  we did not observe significant variation with respect to stress  release by changing OAI concentration of interest, which is  likely suggested a relatively easy incorporation process as will  be discussed later.  \n\nX-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of perovskite films with post  treatment are shown in Figure 2c,d and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. Mainly, the diffraction peak at   $2\\theta=12.7^{\\circ}$  is attributed to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , and the peak at   $2\\theta=14.0^{\\circ}$   corresponds  to (001) crystallographic planes\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
