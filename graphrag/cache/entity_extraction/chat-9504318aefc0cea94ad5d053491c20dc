CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

To suppress that  oxidation, much effort has been exerted  to improve the enduring stability of the  performance of tin-based PSC,  for  example, through changing the electronic  structure of perovskite, providing a uniform and close-packed film, introducing  hydrogen bonding and a hydrophobic  shell, and so forth.  \n\nThe stability of a tin-based perovskite solar cell is a major challenge. Here,  hybrid tin-based perovskite solar cells in a new series that incorporate a  nonpolar organic cation, guan id in i um   $(\\mathsf{G A}^{+})$  , in varied proportions into the  form amid in i um   $(\\mathsf{F A}^{+})$   tin triiodide perovskite   $(\\mathsf{F A S n l}_{3})$  ) crystal structure in the  presence of   $\\daleth\\%$   ethylene di ammonium diiodide   $(\\mathsf{E D A I}_{2})$   as an additive, are  reported. The device performance is optimized at a precursor ratio (GAI:FAI)  of 20:80 to attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of   $\\mathbf{8.5\\%}$   when prepared  freshly; the efficiencies continuously increase to attain a record PCE of   $9.6\\%$    after storage in a glove-box environment for  $\\mathbf{2000\\,h}$  . The hybrid perovskite  works stably under continuous 1 sun illumination for  $\\sf{l\\hslash}$   and storage in air  for 6 days without encapsulation. Such a tin-based perovskite passes all  harsh standard tests, and the efficiency of a fresh device,   $\\pmb{8.3\\%}$  , is certified.  The great performance and stability of the device reported herein attains a  new milestone for lead-free perovskite solar cells on a path toward commercial development.  \n\nForm amid in i um   $\\mathrm{(FA^{+})}$   is larger than   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  .   ${\\mathrm{FAsnI}}_{3}$   has a greater energy of formation of Sn vacancies because of weaker  coupling between   $\\mathrm{Sn}$   and I;    ${\\mathrm{FAsnI}}_{3}$    has thereby a smaller p-type conductivity  than   ${\\mathrm{Mdown}}_{3}$   and acts as a semiconductor.  Wang et  al.  studied the interaction of  both   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   and   ${\\mathrm{Mdown}}_{3}$   per ovsk ites  with water and concluded that these two  \n\nLead-based perovskite solar cells (PSC) have progressed rapidly  in recent years to attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE)  over   $23\\%$   and have inspired hopes of scientists and engineers  to develop cost-effective next-generation solar cells.  Two  issues remain to be addressed before PSC can be commercialized—their stability and the toxicity of lead in PSC. Several  effective approaches  have been employed to improve the stability of lead-based PSC devices, but toxic element lead must  be replaced with a nontoxic material such as tin.  Tin-based  per ovsk ites have the advantages of smaller optical bandgaps   and greater charge mobility than their lead-based per ovsk ites,   but tin-based PSC are apt to suffer oxidation from  $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   to   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  .   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   acts as a   $\\mathtt{p}$  -dopant within the perovskite in a process so  called  self-doping  and increases the concentrations of holes that  could lead to severe recombination of charge carriers in these  solar cells.  Early tests of methyl ammonium tin triiodide  \n\ncations affect the electronic structure of the oxygen-bonded  perovskite lattice;   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   has a smaller rate of oxidation of   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$    than   ${\\mathrm{Mdown}}_{3}$  . They also suggested that stable   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  -based perovskite devices might be realized through an appropriate choice  of organic cation to ensure effective protection against water  penetration.  As a result, organic cation   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   has been used to  make a   ${\\mathrm{FAsnI}}_{3}$   or hybrid   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}/M A^{+}}$   device with PCE   $4–8\\%$  .   Moreover, applying large hydrophobic ammonium cations such  as but yl ammonium   $\\mathrm{(BA^{+})}$   or phenyl ethyl ammonium   $\\mathrm{(PEA^{+})}$    within   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   to develop a quasi $.2\\mathrm{D}^{[21]}$   or hybrid 2D/3D   PSC was reported to make stable devices with PCE as great  as  $9.0\\%$  .  \n\nBeyond   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$  and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  , organic cation guan id in i um   $\\mathrm{(CH}_{6}\\mathrm{N}_{3}{}^{+}$  ,  GA), of size  $\\approx\\!278\\ \\mathrm{pm}^{[22]}$   that is slightly larger than that of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$     $(\\approx\\!253~\\mathrm{pm})^{[22]}$   but has zero electric-dipolar moment, might be a  suitable candidate for a tin-based PSC.  The empirical Goldschmidt tolerance factor of   ${\\mathrm{GAGG}}_{3}$   is 1.051;   ${\\mathrm{GAGG}}_{3}$   has a hex- agonal geometry with crystal structures of two types, both with  large bandgaps:   $1.9\\,\\mathrm{~eV~}$   for the 3D hexagonal structure, space  group   $P63/m_{z}$  , and   $2.1\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for the 2D monoclinic structure,  space group   $P21/n$  , near 296 K.  \n\nWe applied organic cation precursor GAI mixed with FAI  in varied proportions with equimolar   $\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{nI}_{2}$   precursor in the  presence of   $\\mathrm{SnF}_{2}$   and ethylene di ammonium diiodide   $(\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2})$    as additives to enhance both the photovoltaic performance  and the enduring stability of a tin-based perovskite. As demo­ nstrated at the top of  Figure    1 , we prepared the tin perov­ skites according to stoic hio metric ratios of their precursors;  these prepared per ovsk ites conform to a general expression,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/ae30a5346ed55511156e85e3035ca11acdc6a6c2c9891a87ea887c8206fdc0cc-1727121665.jpg)  \n\n$\\mathrm{GA}_{x}\\mathrm{FA}_{1-x-2y}\\mathrm{snI}_{3}{-\\gamma}\\mathrm{EDAA}_{2},$  , abbreviated as   $\\mathrm{E}\\gamma\\mathrm{G}x$   with integers \n\n  $_x$  and   $\\gamma$   representing the corresponding proportions without  showing percentage symbol   $(\\%)$  . Upon increasing the ratios  GAI:FAI, the size of the perovskite crystal increases continuously, but no phase transition was observed (Figure  1a). The  device performance became optimal at GAI   $20\\%$   and   $\\mathrm{EDAA}_{2}\\,1\\%$    (E1G20), for which a fresh cell showed the best PCE   $8.5\\%$   and  certified efficiency  $8.3\\%$  . The device performance was certified  under a strict condition to prove the superior stability of our  devices. Moreover, when the device was stored in a glove box,  the performance increased continuously, to attain PCE\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
