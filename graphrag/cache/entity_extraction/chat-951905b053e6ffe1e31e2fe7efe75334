CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Furthermore, the undesirable  phase transition and phase segregation that are notorious in  the FA based per ovsk ites are found suppressed, as evidenced  by much reduced dark current and significantly enhanced stability. These excellent properties enable us to design and fabricate a highly sensitive stable X-ray imaging system with the  following remarkable features: 1) the X-ray detectors fabricated using the FAMACs SCs present the highest sensitivity of   $(3.5\\pm0.2)\\times10^{6}~\\upmu\\mathrm{C}~\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   among all perovskite devices  reported to date, this value is more than 3 orders of magnitude  better than that of the state-of-the-art commercial   $\\alpha{\\cdot}S\\mathrm{e}$   detectors   $(440\\,\\,\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{C}\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}{}^{-1}\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ; 2) The detection limit as low as   $42\\mathrm{~nGy_{air}~s^{-1}}$   is realized on the FAMACs SCs, 131 times lower  than what used in regular medical diagnostics   $(5.5~\\mu\\mathrm{Gy_{\\mathrm{air}}~s^{-1}})$  ;  3) the FAMACs SC X-ray detector shows stable response even  under high bias, much better than what reported in   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$   SC  and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   SC X-ray detectors; 4) FAMACs SC shows higher  hardness than other popular perovskite SCs; 5) the above  advantages, therefore, enable FAMACs SC detector array to  realize high-contrast X-ray imaging. This synergistic enhancement of multi-cation and mixed-halide strategy, together with  inch-sized single crystal growth could enable highly stable  high-performance new-generation X-ray detection systems.  \n\nCompared  with  the  popular   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   perovskite, the   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{F}}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}{\\mathrm{bl}}_{3}$   is known for its better device performance,  however, this material is thermodynamic ally unstable at room  temperature. The crystal structure of   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{F}}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}{\\mathrm{bl}}_{3}$   is the cubic  aristotype perovskite and consists of corner-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI}_{6}]^{4-}$    octahedra spanning to three directions, while   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   reside in  the cubo-octahedral cavities charge balancing the structure  ( Figure   1 a).  For the cubic   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , the lattice parameter   $(a)$    is 6.3620(8)   $\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}_{:}$  , which equals the distance between two   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  .   In   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , the ion radius of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}=2.53\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$   and   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}=2.20\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$  , thus   $a$   lattice parameter should be   $\\sqrt{2}(r_{\\mathrm{FA}}+r_{\\mathrm{I}})=6.6892$   Å, much  longer than the experimental value. Therefore, lattice stress  exists in the   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   perovskite crystal structure because of the  ionic size mismatch between the FA cation and the   $[\\mathrm{PbI}_{6}]^{4-}$    cage, resulting in the cage distortion and tilting, as reported  in the literatures.  This lattice strain is also the origin of the  thermodynamic instability of this material which gives rise to  the thermodynamic ally stable at room temperature non-perovskite yellow phase   $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$  .  The stress can be relieved at least  partially by forming vacancy point defects due to low formation  energy.  As depicted in Figure 1b (left part), both   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$    vacancies (point defects) can form in   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   to reduce lattice  stress. The lattice stress of the cubic phase   $(\\alpha{\\mathrm{FAPbI}}_{3})$  ) however is best released spontaneously by transforming into yellow   $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$  , as the single crystal photographs and powder X-ray  diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Figure 1c (upper part) and  Figure  1d. In contrast, one can also reduce the lattice stress  without transforming to the yellow phase by incorporating  smaller cations like   $C s^{+}$   (1.69 Å),   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   (2.17 Å), and/or anions   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}\\ (1.96\\ \\mathring{A})}$   into the “overcrowded lattice structure” to replace  part of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   (2.53 Å) and   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   (2.20 Å) ions.  As illustrated in  Figure 1b (right part), the incorporation of smaller ions helps  suppress the formation of vacancy defects in   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , making  the 3-cation mixed-halide FAMACs SCs more stable. In this  work, we report the successful growth of high-quality, 3-cation  mixed-halide   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.1}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.05}\\mathrm{PbI}_{2.55}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.45}$  with optimized  composition perovskite single crystals. As large as inch-sized  high-quality FAMACs SCs were grown as shown in Figure 1c  (lower part), with more experimental details provided in the  Supporting Information. Compared with the   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   SCs, the  FAMACs SCs are phase stable even exposed in ambient environment for 60 days. Figure 1e shows the powder XRD patterns  of the FAMACs SCs, with absence of non-perovskite diffraction  peaks during the 60-day test period.  \n\nIn per ovsk ites, vacancies enable pathways for ion migration.  To assess the ion migration level in the present FAMACs SCs,  temperature-dependent conductivity was measured in dark.  Generally, electronic conduction is the main cause of conductivity at low-temperature as the ion migration is suppressed.  In this work, the ion migration rate of the FAMACs SCs was  characterized by the activation energy   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$   of ionic conductivity,  calculated using the Nernst–Einstein equation from the temperature-dependent measurements  \n\n$$\n\\sigma\\left(T\\right)=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\scriptscriptstyle0}}{T}\\,\\exp\\left({-\\frac{E_{\\scriptscriptstyle a}}{k_{\\scriptscriptstyle B}T}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere   $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$   is the Boltzmann constant,   $\\sigma_{0}$   a constant, and   $T$  the temperature. The conduct iv i ties of the SC devices were  extracted by fitting the   $I{-}V$  curves in the high-temperature  region,  as shown in Figure  1f. The ionic conductivity (ion  migration) activation energy was calculated to be   $0.77\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for  the FAMACs SC, while a smaller value of   $0.53~\\mathrm{eV}$   is calculated  for the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   SC, suggesting that by incorporating smaller  ions, the number of vacancy defects is effectively reduced in  the FAMACs SCs, so is the ion migration.  Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows that the FAMACs SCs also exhibit  enhanced thermal stability when compared to the   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$   SCs.  \n\nXRD is used to evaluate the quality of the FAMACs SC.
