CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Same measurements were performed on   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, based on which, the  phase diagram is determined and plotted in Figure 2d. The  phase transition temperature   $T_{\\mathrm{O-T}}$   which relates to the oxygen  octahedron tilting, is found to increase with Ta addition, while   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{2}-M_{3}}}$   and   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{1}-M_{2}}}$  , which are associated with the cation (  $\\mathrm{Ag}$   and  Nb) displacements, exhibit contrary trend. Of particular interest  is that   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{3}-O}}$  , which is between   $T_{\\mathrm{O-T}}$  and   $T_{\\mathrm{M}_{2}-\\mathrm{M}_{3}},$  , remains the  same value with Ta addition. The constant   $T_{\\mathrm{M_{3}-O}}$   might be  due to the combined effects of oxygen octahedron tilting and  cation displacement. According to this phase diagram, samples  with   $x=15{-}20\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\%$   are in   $\\mathrm{M}_{2}$   phase at room temperature,  which might be mixed ferri electric and anti ferroelectric phases  because they are close to   $\\mathrm{M}_{1}\\mathrm{-M}_{2}$   phase boundary.  \n\nTo confirm the room-temperature anti ferro electricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, the polarization hysteresis and dielectric tunability were measured. It is observed that the AFE  to FE phase transition for pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics occurs at   $125\\;\\mathrm{kV}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , where both   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and   $P_{\\mathrm{max}}$   are found to increase with  increasing   $E$   field to   $150~\\mathrm{kV~cm}^{-1}$  , as given in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The nonzero   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   value in   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$  ceramic  is attributed to the FIE phase.  Meanwhile, the dielectric tunability of pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   shows a significant shape change as a  function of applied electric field   $(E_{\\mathrm{max}})$   from 50 to   $150~\\mathrm{kV}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  .  At low   $E_{\\mathrm{max}}$  of   $50\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\kV}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-1}}$  , the dielectric constant decreases  monotonously with increasing   $E$  field, while different dielectric  tunability behavior is observed at higher   $E_{\\mathrm{max}}$   over   $75\\;\\mathrm{kV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  . It  is worth noting a drop in the dielectric constant appears as   $E_{\\mathrm{max}}$  is above   $125\\ensuremath{~\\mathrm{kV}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}$   due to the AFE-FE phase transition. Generally, the dielectric constants of FE materials decrease with  increasing   $E$  field, being saturated at higher applied   $E$   field. For AFE materials, on the contrary, the dielectric constant first  increases linearly with increasing   $E$  field, while behaving nonlinearly at higher   $E$  field prior to AFE-FE phase transition.  Thus,   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramic exhibits both FE-like and AFE-like behavior in  dielectric tunability, which is associated with the FIE   $\\mathrm{M}_{1}$   phase.  \n\nThe AFE-FE phase transition can be observed in both the   $P{-}E$   loop and dielectric tunability in pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics at  E  field of   $150\\;\\mathrm{kV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , as shown in  Figure   3 a.

The increase  in   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and decrease in   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}/E_{\\mathrm{A}}$   negatively impact  the   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}$  . On the contrary,   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$  ceramic shows a slim   $P{-}E$   loop at the same  applied electric field, where AFE-like behavior  is found to coexist with FE-like behavior in  dielectric tunability curve prior to AFE-FE  phase transition (Figure 3b), while the FElike behavior disappears in dielectric tunability at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  (Figure 3d). Together with  transmission electron microscope (TEM)  image as given in  Figure   4 , this suggests  the weakened FIE phase in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})}$   $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   composition. In addition, it should be  noted that a higher   $E$   field or temperature is  required to trigger the AFE-FE phase transition for   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$   ceramics due to  the increased   $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}/E_{\\mathrm{{A}}},$   which will benefit the  energy storage density.  \n\nFigure 4a presents a bright-field TEM  image of pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$   ceramics. It is interesting to note that three domain walls intersect each other. SAED patterns taken from  the domains (labeled   $\\textcircled{1}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\circled{3}\\!\\!\\!)$   in the highresolution electron microscopy (HREM)  image [Figure 4b] are given in Figure 4e–g,  respectively.
