CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

These results are  consistent with the MTF results in Figure 2d. Finally, we also  checked the long-term st abilities of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor  by measuring the changes in X-ray images according to the  cumulative dose as shown in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor lost only   $4\\%$   of its initial ADC value (absolutely from 3722 to 3585) after  $40\\ \\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  ,  which is comparable to that of GOS scintilla tor.  \n\nIn summary, we successfully demonstrated a new   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  PNCs-based indirect-type X-ray detector with high stability,  response time, and resolution. Due to the high quantum yield  of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor compared with the conventional  GOS scintilla tor, it exhibited higher ratio of light output power/ absorptivity than the GOS sample. Owing to more than fivefold  shorter  $\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor than the GOS sample,  the response time of PNCs sample had more than five times  faster than the GOS sample. The synthesized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs  have mono dispersed cubic shape with   $9\\,\\pm\\,1.5\\,\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   in average  size so that they could greatly reduce the light scattering, which  deteriorates the spatial resolution of X-ray image, thereby exhibiting better spatial resolution of   $9.8~\\mathrm{lp~mm^{-1}}$   at   $\\mathrm{MTF}=0.2$   and \n\n  $12.5{-}8.9\\ \\mathrm{lg\\mm^{-1}}$   for a linear line chart than the GOS sample \n\n (6.2 at   $\\mathrm{MTF}=0.2$   and   $6.3\\ \\mathrm{lp\\mm^{-1}}$   for a linear line chart). In  addition, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor had comparable stability with the conventional GOS scintilla tor over X-ray irradiation of   $40\\;\\mathrm{Gy}_{\\mathrm{air}}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . Conclusively, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor  based indirect X-ray detectors provide better quality of X-ray  images at reduced X-ray exposure than the conventional GOS  scintilla tor based indirect X-ray detectors and a-Se-based directtype X-ray detectors. So we believe that the large-area   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  PNCs scintilla tor can offer great potential for next-generation  industrial readout electronics and medical diagnostics.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nFabrication of  $C s P b B r_{3}$   Perovskite NCs X-ray Scintilla tor : To fabricate the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   perovskite NCs X-ray scintilla tor, we synthesized the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$  perovskite NCs by following procedure. For preparing Cs–oleate solution,   $0.814~\\mathrm{g}$   of  $\\mathsf{C s C O}_{3}$   (Aldrich,  $99.9\\%)$  ) and  $2.5~\\mathsf{m L}$   of oleic acid (OA, Aldrich   $90\\%)$  ) were reacted in   $40~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of octadecene (ODE, Aldrich,   $90\\%$  ) under   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   condition at   $\\ 750\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   until all  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   reacted with OA. After then, the  mixture of  $0.069{\\mathrm{~g~}}{\\mathsf{P b B r}}_{2}$     $(99.999\\%$  , Aldrich) and   $5~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   ODE was reacted  with  $0.5~{\\mathsf{r n L}}$   of oleylamine (Acros,   $80–90\\%)$  ) and   $0.5~{\\mathsf{r n L}}$   of OA under   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$  condition at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $\\sf{l}~\\sf{h}$   and then   $0.4~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of Cs–oleate solution was  quickly injected. The reaction mixture was reacted at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\;\\;10\\;s$   and  then cooled by ice–water bath. After cooling down, the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs  were separated from solvent by cent ri fuga tion, and then re dispersed  in Hexan.   $50~\\mathrm{mg}$   of photo initiator (BASF, Irgacure 819) was dispersed  in methyl meth a cry late (MMA,   $5~\\mathsf{m L}$  , Aldrich,   $99\\%$  ). 1 mL of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$  perovskite NCs solution (concentration of CsPbX3 NCs of  $\\approx\\!0.1\\ \\mathrm{g\\mum^{-1}}$  )  was added to MMA/photo initiator mixture. The mixture was spin-coated  on glass substrate at 500 rpm for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$   and then dried on the hot plate at   $50~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 5 min. The polymerization took place under UV irradiation for \n\n  $\\mathsf{\\tau}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathsf{\\Sigma}\\mathsf{h}$   in a glovebox.  \n\nScintilla tor Material Characterization : Absorption and PL data of the \n\n  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   NCs were measured with a Shimadzu model UV 3600 plus  and RF-6000, TRPL characteristics were measured by a ChronosBH-ISS  technology measuring equipment, and X-ray dose rates were measured  with a multifunction meter (Magicmax Rad, Daol). The stated dose was  the entrance dose in air, measured in air at the surface of the sample.  Between cathode and anode in acceleration voltage of   $50~\\mathrm{kV}$   was used  to generate the  $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray photons. The air kinetic energy released per unit  mass is commonly used in medical applications to give a measurement  parameter for the dose exposed to a patient. This parameter was used to  calculate the patient dose. Therefore,   $\\mathsf{m G y}_{\\mathrm{air}}$   allowed a comparison with  any other medical detector.  \n\nImage Readout and Processing : Images from the   $1650\\times1246$   CMOS  backplane with Si-photodiode and  $20\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   pixel size were read by a readout  integrated circuit (IC). The signal at the input was simultaneously  integrated, amplified, low-pass filtered, and converted from analog to  digital with a 12 bit converter. Noise produced by the external readout  electronics detector panel was characterized by taking dark images  without and with sensor. To eliminate fixed detector noise, dark images  were subtracted. The mean value and the standard deviation were  calculated from a region of interest. The standard deviation presents the  electronic noise in numbers of electrons. X-ray image from objects were  offset compensated by subtracting a dark image and flat-field corrected  by calculating the gain factor of each pixel.
