CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Apparently, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor film exhibited  stronger PL in entire area than the GOS scintilla tor film so it  is expected that the new PNCs will have better emission under  irradiation of X-ray than the conventional GOS scintilla tor.  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor was synthesized by solution  chemistry  and its transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  image was shown in Figure 1d. This indicates that the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  PNCs are cubic or bar shape, an average size of   $9\\,\\pm\\,1.5\\,\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  ,  and mono dispersed. The inset is a magnified TEM image of  single PNC confirming that it has a cubic crystalline structure  exposing   $\\{100\\}$   facet. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in  Figure 1e exhibited the peak at   $14.38^{\\circ}$  ,   $20.58^{\\circ}$  ,   $29.92^{\\circ}$  ,   $33.56^{\\circ}$  , \n\n  $37.18^{\\circ}$  , and   $43.22^{\\circ}$   corresponded to (100), (110), (200), (210), \n\n (211), and (220) crystal planes of cubic crystal structure.  \n\nTo compare the emission (scintillation) properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  PNCs and GOS scintilla tor, we checked static PL and dynamic  PL as shown in Figure 1f,g. The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor  film exhibited a strong single PL peak at  ${\\approx}550\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , whereas the  GOS scintilla tor film had multiple PL peaks between 370 and   $630\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   wavelength (maximum at   $544\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) due to multiple  down-conversion by Tb-doping states. To compare the time  resolution of both scintilla tors, we measured the time-resolved  PL (TRPL) spectra as shown in Figure 1g because it is very  important to reduce X-ray radiation dose/poisoning to patients  as small as possible. The   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor had much  faster decay than the conventional GOS scintilla tor. From fitting with bi-exponential function, we can obtain that the PNCs  scintilla tor has an average PL lifetime   $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}})$   of 2.87 ns (  $(48.24\\%$  of 0.46 ns and   $51.76\\%$   of 5.28 ns lifetime) and the GOS one  has   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{avg}}$   of 15.99 ns   $(25.48\\%$   of 5.94 ns and   $74.52\\%$   of 26.03 ns  lifetime). This implies that the new PNCs scintilla tor can reduce  the X-ray radiation dose to patients significantly compared with  conventional GOS one. Also, we compared the response times  of both scintilla tors by using a mechanical chopper under illumination of   $285~\\mathrm{nm}~\\mathrm{UV}$   as shown in Figure 1h. The response  time of mechanical chopper (Si-PD),   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs, and GOS  scintilla tor was   ${\\approx}20\\$  , 200, 1200 ns, respectively, which is well  matched with the TRPL results.  \n\nTo compare the performance of both scintilla tors with  respect to X-ray, we used two kinds of X-ray generators. One  is a continuous X-ray generator assembled by tungsten source  (Apogee 5500 series-part #93 501, Oxford instruments), which  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/3c2b36d02a6a7eb1a799161c7bdbe919e24f7e7413a7354eb2c3e3741efce2d4-1727118144.jpg)  \nFigure 2.  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and conventional GOS scintilla tors for X-ray imaging. a) X-ray absorption and X-ray absorption  efficiency of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and conventional GOS scintilla tors, b) light output power density and conversion efficiency of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and conventional GOS scintilla tors, c) analog-to-digital converted values of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and GOS scintilla tor based X-ray detectors with X-ray dose rate, and  d) MTF of pristine Si-PD,   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   PNCs and conventional GOS scintilla tors based   $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray detector.  \n\nis operating in the range of   $10{-}50\\,\\mathrm{~kV~}$   and max anode current of   $1~\\mathrm{mA}$  .

The other is commercialized X-ray  generator for dental clinic (orthoceph-oc-100, In strum eta rium  Dental). To measure the X-ray absorption of the two scintillators, we placed the scintilla tor on a multifunction meter and  measured the X-ray dose values. The absorbed amount of  the scintilla tor was calculated by using the measured dose  value without the scintilla tor as shown in  Figure   2 a. Although  the mass attenuation value of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   was slightly lower than  the GOS at   $50~\\mathrm{kVp}$   (as shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information),  the X-ray absorptivity of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintillator was higher than the GOS scintilla tor at   $50\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{kVp}}$   tube  voltage because the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   scintilla tor   $(1.62\\ \\mathrm{mm})$   is thicker  than GOS scintilla tor   $.0.25\\,\\mathrm{\\mm})$  ), as shown in Figure S3 in  the Supporting Information. It should be noted that thinner   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   scintilla tor film with similar X-ray absorptivity with the  GOS film also can be made by adjusting concentration of PNCs  in PMMA matrix. Accordingly, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PNCs scintilla tor  exhibited the higher X-ray absorption efficiency than GOS scintillator.
