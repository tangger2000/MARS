CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

As shown in Figure 2d–f, both   $\\mathrm{FPMAI_{0.7}B r_{0.3}};$   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.33}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.67}\\mathrm{TFA}$   and FPMATFA have pass iv ation effect and  result in higher PLQY than the control film (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Notably, the perovskite film shows a  relatively high PLQY of   $15\\%$   with   $40\\%$   molar extra FPMATFA  even at a low excitation intensity of   $0.008\\mathrm{~mW~}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . Bi-exponential decays were used to fit the TRPL curves. The slow decay  component could be attributed to radiative recombination,  while the fast decay component could be ascribed to nonradiative recombination.  As shown in  Table   1 , the average decay  time increases from 54.2 to 63.3 ns with   $60\\%$     $\\mathrm{FPMAI}_{0.7}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.3}$  .  In contrast, the average decay time increases to 162.2 ns with   $40\\%$   extra FPMATFA. Both   $T_{\\mathrm{average}}$   and PLQY decrease with  FPMATFA molar ratio reaching   $\\bar{80\\%}$  . This might be due to  formation of too much quasi-2D phases in the film.  We  further calculate the radiative and non radiative recombination  rate   $(k_{\\mathrm{rad}},\\,k_{\\mathrm{nonrad}})$   of the films using equation   $\\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{average}}}\\!=\\!k_{\\mathrm{rad}}+\\!k_{\\mathrm{nonrad}}$  and   $\\mathrm{PLQY}\\,{=}\\,\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rad}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rad}}+k_{\\mathrm{nonrad}}}$  . As shown in Table 1, with   $40\\%$   molar  excess of FPMATFA, the film has lowest non radiative recombination rate of   $4.51\\times10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , further demonstrating its better  pass iv ation effect.  \n\nThe improved optical properties of MHP films with  FPMATFA enable us to fabricate efficient PeLEDs.

SEM surface images show reduced grain sizes after incorporation of FPMATFA additives as compared with the control  film (Figure   $\\mathrm{S7a-e}$  , Supporting Information).

Excitingly, the EQE reaches   $18.3\\%$   and   $20.9\\%$  , respectively, after  incorporation of   $20\\%$   and   $40\\%$   molar excess of FPMATFA, a  rather high value for mixed-halide PeLEDs.
