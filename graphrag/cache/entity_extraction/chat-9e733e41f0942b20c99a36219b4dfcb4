CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

As shown in Figure 4b, the K–L plots are linear and parallel,  which manifest that the   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   kinetics on the catalyst of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$    is a first order dependence.  The electron transfer number  ( n ) of the   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   was calculated to be in the range of 1.14–1.17  from the slopes of the   $\\mathrm{K}{-}\\mathrm{L}$   plots in Figure 4b, indicating a  two-electron reduction reaction is dominant during the ORR  process for   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   in   $0.1~\\mathrm{~M~}$   KOH. In comparison, the K–L  plots of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}2$   are obtained at 0.76, 0.75, and   $0.74\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$    (vs RHE), as shown in Figure 4d, which are linear and parallel similarly. However, the electron transfer number of the   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$   was calculated to be in the range of 3.90–3.99,  indicating that the ORR process of   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   is nearly  four-electron pathway. These results imply that the decoration  of NiCo alloy nanoparticles on N-doped carbon fibers could  result in more active sites and easier transportation of oxygen  and electrolyte due to the special novel structure, which could  be corresponding to the SEM and TEM images well. Thus, the  ORR catalytic activity of the N-doped carbon fibers have been  enhanced significantly after decorated with NiCo alloy nanoparticles, which might also be attributed to the change of the  electron transfer pathway from 2e to 4e.  \n\nFrom the electrochemical investigations, we could see that  NiC  $\\mathrm{\\cdoto@N\\!\\cdot\\!C}$   2 owns the surprisingly, most outstanding catalytic activities for both the ORR and OER. The special bimetallic alloy uniformly decorated on the N-doped carbon fibers  might also be beneficial for the stability enhancement of the  carbon materials. On the other hand, the high conductivity of  the carbon fibers support could enhance the electron transfer  for the NiCo alloy nano particle, alleviate the aggregation of  the nanoparticles and accelerate the ions transport during  ORR and OER processes. The ORR process stability was  measured in   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   -saturated   $0.1\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$   KOH at half-wave potential  under a rotating rates of   $1600~\\mathrm{rpm}$   for   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and NiCo  $_{\\mathrm{{'@N.C}}}$    2, and the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   has also been tested under the  same condition for better comparison, the results are shown  in  Figure   5 a.
