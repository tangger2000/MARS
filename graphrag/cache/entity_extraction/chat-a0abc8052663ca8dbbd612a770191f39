CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Importantly,  the peak EQE is high as   $2.6\\%$   (Figure 5d), which is one of the  best preformed perovskite-based LEDs in the deep-blue region  (Table  S2, Supporting Information). The average peak EQE  collected from a dozen of devices is about   $2.2\\%$  , as shown in  Figure  S15 (Supporting Information). The EL spectra at different driving voltages are listed in Figure 5e, where EL peaks  and FWHM were fixed at 465 and   $25\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   regardless of bias  voltage. Meanwhile, the EL emission delivered a coordinate of \n\n (0.14, 0.05), meeting the crucial blue NTSC standard of (0.14, \n\n 0.08) (Figure 5f). Moreover, chromatic it y of this deep-blue emission provide a wide color coverage (gamut), which achieves   $99.4\\%$   of the NTSC standard in the CIE 1931. Except EQE and  spectra stability, operational stability is also a tough challenge  for perovskite LED. In Figure  $5\\mathrm{g}.$  , we conducted time-dependent  EL trace under constant driven current of   $0.35~\\mathrm{\\mA}$      $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$    (current density at peak EQE), in which the EL spectra were  invariable. We recorded the corresponding evolution of luminance in Figure 5h, the   $\\mathrm{T}_{50}$   defined as time when luminance  declines to   $50\\%$   of initial value was   $13.5\\,\\mathrm{min}$  . In Figure  S16  (Supporting Information), the time dependent bias voltage was  also recorded. We suggest that excessive carriers injection and  ensuing non radiative recombination in perovskite active layer  (especially for blue ones) are severely detrimental to materials’  stability.  With aim at pursuing longer operational lifetime,  faster radiative recombination, better conductivity (lower joule  heat during electrical injection) and improved ionic stabilization in perovskite layer are expected to be achieved in the future  work.  \n\nThis work uncovers the factors responsible for nonideal  stability of low-dimensional domains in 2D perovskite films.  A newly tailored and promising spacer molecule with strong  bonding force with inorganic layers was used to pin the  domain distribution in quasi-2D perovskite film. This resulted  in stable deep-blue emission mainly from   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain. Furthermore, a mixed spacer system was set up to control la bly  modulate the domains’ population, by which   $\\mathrm{n}_{1}$   domain with  severely non radiative recombination and retarded exciton  transfer was dramatically suppressed, meanwhile, the population of   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain (emitting species) was enhanced without  by-product of higher  $n$   domains. Such an exceptional composition led to fast and complete exciton transfer. The optimized  2D perovskite film delivered ideally independent emission  from   $\\mathrm{n}_{3}$   domain (peak at   $465\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) with high PLQY of   $77\\%$  .  Finally, the fabricated LED exhibited stable deep-blue emission with fixed EL peak and FWHM. The CIE coordinate  (0.145, 0.052) totally matched the blue requirement of NTSC  standard. The obtained EQE is one of the highest results for  full-bromide PeLEDs with deep-blue emission. Our work provides a guide to design stable deep-blue quasi-2D perovskite  material with high PLQY for electroluminescence, which  may also have potential for the development of other kinds of  applications.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/253a719de7becccaee5413f30a54ff05c4805df1224b47a39ed0f9a60ee2efad-1723834750.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $J{-}V{-}L$   curves of the best-preformed LED.  d) Current efficiency and EQE versus voltage characteristics. e) EL spectra under various bias voltages (inset: photograph of a working device). f) The  CIE 1931 chromatic coordinates of our device. g) Time-dependent evolution of EL spectra at   $0.{\\bar{35}}\\,\\,{\\mathsf{m A}}\\,\\,{\\mathsf{c m}}^{-2}$   (peak EQE). h) Operational lifetime  measurement of the deep-blue LED under constant driven current density of   $0.35\\ \\mathsf{m A}\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  .  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials and Chemicals : CsBr,   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$  , DMSO (anhydrous,   $99.9\\%)$  ),  hydrobromic  acid  (HBr),  1,4-bis(amino methyl)benzene  (P-PDA),  p-phenyl ene dia mine, and per flu or in a ted ionomer (PFI, Nafion 117  solution) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
