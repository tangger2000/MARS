CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is found that with the layer number  decreasing, the   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}$   of SNO decreases from   $0.088\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  for 7L SNO to 0.039 and   $0.007\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   for 6L and 4L SNO,  respectively. The declined   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}$   with a decreased layer number  could be explained by dominant inter facial impurities in  atomically thin channels.  In addition, the output charact eris tics of SNO FET (Figure 4c) prove that the   $I_{\\mathrm{{ds}}}$   could be  effectively modulated by the gate voltage, where   $I_{\\mathrm{{ds}}}$   shows an  obvious increase with the positive shift of   $V_{\\mathrm{gs}}$  . Furthermore,  according to the semi-logarithmic transfer curve in dark condition (Figure 4d), the SNO FET exhibits an ambipolar behavior  that electron and hole conduction could both be modulated by  applied   $V_{{\\mathrm{gs}}}$  . The on/off ratios for electron accumulation and  hole accumulation are measured to be over   $10^{5}$   and   $8\\,\\times\\,10^{3}$  ,  \n\nrespectively. By contrast, when under UV illumination, no  ambipolar behavior is observed in the SNO FET, and the   $I_{\\mathrm{{ds}}}$   is  less dependent on the   $V_{{\\mathrm{gs}}}$   compared with that in dark, although  the photo current could be further enhanced by the positive  shift of   $V_{{\\mathrm{gs}}}$  . Under   $270\\ \\mathrm{nm\\UV}$   illumination, the   $I_{\\mathrm{{ds}}}$   reaches its  maximum as high as  $75\\;\\mathrm{nA}$   at   $V_{\\mathrm{gs}}=15\\;\\mathrm{V}.$  \n\nTo better understand the temperature-dependent carrier  transport properties, the low-temperature transfer characteristic of the SNO transistor is investigated from 60 to   $300\\,\\mathrm{~K~}$  in vacuum. And the result suggests that with lowering temperature, the   $I_{\\mathrm{{ds}}}$   of 7L SNO increases and then decreases after  reaching the maximum at the temperature of   $100\\;\\mathrm{~K~}$  . Based  on the transfer curves, the temperature dependence of   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}$  could be extracted (Figure 4f). It is found that the  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}$   depends  strongly on the temperature in a non monotonic way, with  its maximum located at about   $100~\\mathrm{~K~}$  . Similar temperaturedependent mobility results were observed in some other 2D  materials.  This nonlinear   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}$   versus   $T$   relationship could  be explained by two co-existing carrier scattering mechanisms  in SNO nanosheets, which have a great effect on the mean  free time of carriers and, consequently, on the carrier mobility.  According to previous studies, the temperature dependence  of   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}$   dominated by both phonon and impurity scattering is  expressed as follows  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{_{\\mathrm{FE}}}\\propto\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{A}T^{3/2}+\\frac{\\mathrm{B}}{T^{3/2}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $A$   and   $B$   are coefficients related to phonon scattering  and impurity scattering, respectively. With the equation, the   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}$    versus   $T$   data points can be well fitted, to some extent  validating the proposed scattering mechanism of carriers in  SNO nanosheets. That is, the carrier transport is dominated by  impurity scattering at low temperature   $(<\\!100~\\mathrm{K})$  , and is limited  mainly by phonon scattering at higher temperature as thermal  vibration increases.  It is noteworthy that the measured   $\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}$  in Figure 4e is lower than that in Figure 4b (in the air), which  may be attributed to the increased oxygen defects’ scattering  in vacuum environment when conducting low-temperature  measurements.  \n\nThe proposed band diagrams of SNO PDs under different  circumstances are shown in Figure  4g. In dark conditions,  SNO PDs are in an equilibrium state with small Schottky barriers at the electrode contacts. When external   $V_{\\mathrm{ds}}$   is applied,  electrons transport from source to drain according to thermionic and tunneling mechanisms, forming a relatively low  dark current. As for SNO-based transistors, the dark current  could be effectively modulated by modifying the   $V_{\\mathrm{gs}}$  . Under  UV illumination, a great number of photo generated electron–hole pairs in SNO are effectively separated by external   $V_{\\mathrm{ds}}$  , contributing greatly to the photo current. As gate voltage– induced carriers are heavily outnumbered by photo generated  ones, the photoelectric effect dominates over the thermionic  and tunneling mechanisms in photo current, leading to a dramatically enhanced and less   $V_{{\\mathrm{gs}}}$  -dependent photo current. By  positively increasing the   $V_{\\mathrm{gs}}$  , the contact barriers can be lowered, resulting in a further increased   $I_{\\mathrm{{ds}}}$  . When UV light is  switched off, rapid recombination of photo generated carrier  pairs occurs at abundant recombination centers in SNO  nanosheets, which contributes to the fast decay speed as discussed above.  \n\nNowadays, op to electronic devices with transparent and  flexible features have seen rapid development. Here, flexible SNO film PDs with centimeter scale are easily constructed on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate by a  facile drop-coating approach without any extra additive. The  channel length between two   $\\mathrm{Cr/Au}$   contacts is kept at   $1~\\mathrm{mm}$  .  Prior to the bending test, the flexible PD exhibits a dark current of   $4.7\\ \\mathrm{nA}$   at   $1\\mathrm{~V~}$   bias, and yields the   $I_{\\mathrm{p}}$   of   $1.6~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}$   under   $300\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}\\,\\mathrm{\\UV}$   illumination   $(0.39\\,\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}})$  ), as is shown in  Figure    5 b. The   $R_{\\lambda}$   and EQE curves show clear cutoff edges  at the wavelength of   $350\\;\\mathrm{\\nm}$   with their maximum values  located at   $300\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . The slight redshift of maximum   $R_{\\lambda}$   and  EQE value compared with that of individual nanosheet  devices above   $(270~\\mathrm{nm})$   might be a consequence of decreased  bandgap due to increased film thickness. During the bending  test, the flexible PD could stand up to the bending angle up  to   $80^{\\circ}$   with the  $I_{\\mathrm{p}}$   remaining almost unchanged. It is observed  that the   $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$   shows a declining tendency with the increase of  bending angle, resulting in an increasing on/off ratio when  the bending angle is below   $80^{\\circ}$   (Figure  5f). The declined   $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$   may result from the improved resistance between SNO  nanosheets due to tiny cracks formed during the bending test.  In addition, we investigated the variation of photo detecting  performance after certain cycles of repeated bending test,  with the illustration of one bending cycle shown in Figure S13  (Supporting Information). As is shown in Figure  5g,h, the   $I_{\\mathrm{p}}$   and   $R$   show a rapid declination in the first 100 cycles and  subsequently level off before a sudden drop after around  900 cycles. According to the optical images in Figure S14  (Supporting Information), the evolution of performance is  closely related to the initiation and propagation\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
