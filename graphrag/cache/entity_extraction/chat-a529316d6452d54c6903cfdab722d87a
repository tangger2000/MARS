CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The high thermal stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   may improve the operational stability of PeLEDs,  possibly by suppressing degradation caused by thermal  stresses including Joule heating. Durable   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PeLEDs  have been produced, in which the luminance continuously  increased from   $L_{0}\\approx100$   cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   to   $L_{0}>400$   cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   for   ${\\tt>}15\\mathrm{~h~}$    of operation time (applied current density of   $66.67~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ),  whereas   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   PeLEDs exhibited much poorer stability   $(L_{50}=255\\ \\mathrm{s})$  ).  Also,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PeLEDs with operational lifetime   $(L_{50}\\,\\approx\\,450\\,\\,\\mathrm{min})$  ) higher than that of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   PeLEDs \n\n  $(L_{50}~\\approx~300~\\mathrm{\\min})$   have been reported.  PeLEDs based on \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NPs with a device structure of   $\\mathrm{Au}/\\mathrm{p}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{MgNiO}/\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{3}$   \n\n  $\\mathrm{NPs/n\\mathrm{-}M g Z n O/n^{+}{\\cdot}G a N}$   also had relatively long operational  lifetime of   $L_{80}\\approx9\\mathrm{~h~}$  .

This difference indicates  that high thermal stability does not always guarantee high operational stability of PeLEDs; the reason is that the main degradation mechanism in PeLEDs is related more to ion migration  than to thermal degradation.  \n\nSystems with mixed A-site cations have been investigated  to overcome the limitations of systems with single A-site cations   $(\\mathrm{MAPbX}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FAPbX}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  ) such as spontaneous  transformation to non per ovsk it e phase and material degradation by heat, light incidence, and air exposure.

Incorporation of Rb can also stabilize the perovskite   $\\alpha$  phase of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  .  Mixed-cation systems have  many advantages for PeLEDs, such as reduced trap density,  increased charge-carrier mobility,  and increased  PLQE  compared to those of single-cation systems.  \n\nAlthough material stability has been improved by introducing  mixed-cation systems, the operational stability of PeLEDs  has not been strikingly improved. Green, blue, and infrared  PeLEDs based on triple A-site cations   $\\mathrm{(Cs^{+},\\,M A^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  ) have  been fabricated;  the luminance of the green triple-cation  PeLED increased over time from 736.7 to 1335.7  cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  for   $135~\\mathrm{\\min}$  , then decreased to   $800.7~\\mathrm{~cd~}\\mathrm{~m~}^{-2}$   at   $475~\\mathrm{\\min}$  (Figure 9B), but the operational st abilities of blue and infrared  triple-cation PeLEDs were much inferior to that of green triplecation PeLEDs (Figure 9B,C).  Other groups have reported  mixed-cation PeLEDs, but they had very short operational lifetimes   $(L_{50}\\approx80$   s,  160 s,  and   ${>}1\\ \\mathrm{h}^{[130]}$  ) despite high EL  efficiency   $(33.9\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{A}^{-1})$  ).  \n\n# 3.2. Ruddlesden–Popper Phase  \n\nTo improve the stability of the crystal structure of MHPs,  the formation of an RP phase can be a good strategy. To  form an RP phase, large OA groups should be added to 3D  perovskite structure. The large OA inter ca late s between the  3D perovskite structures to form an RP multi layered structure (quasi-2D structure). The multi layered structure can be  characterized by  the number  m  of   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{6}$   octahedral planes, \n\n  $(m~=~1$   for 2D structure and   $m~=~\\infty$   for 3D structure) \n\n ( Figure   10 A).  \n\nRP MHPs have the potential to increase the EL efficiency in  PeLEDs, because the exciton binding energy of RP MHPs can  be significantly increased by exciton confinement. In RP MHPs  that show 2D exciton behaviors, the exciton binding energy can  increase to  $\\mathrm{>}300~\\mathrm{meV},^{[174-177]}$   which is much higher than that  of 3D counterparts   $(40{-}150~\\mathrm{meV}$   for MAPbBr;   $13{-}50~\\mathrm{meV}$   for   $\\mathrm{\\small{MA}P b I_{3}})$  ).  Assuming that all absorbed photons generate  electron–hole pairs, the PLQE   $\\eta$  can be determined by three  different recombination rates: trap-assisted mono molecular  recombination rate   $k_{1}$   (excitonic recombination rate for RP  MHPs), bimolecular recombination rate   $k_{2\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
