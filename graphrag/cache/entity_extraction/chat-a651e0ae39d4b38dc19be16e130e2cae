CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

From the energy band  diagram in  Figure   5 a, the energy offsets between CBM of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  film and CBM of perovskite film were gradually decreased in  the order of AD, ADCA, and ADAA, which can facilitate elec­ tron extraction and thus restrain inter facial non radiative recom­ bination losses (Figure 5b,c; Table S4, Supporting Information).  The improved inter facial electron extraction can be reflected by  the gradually reduced carrier decay lifetimes from control, AD,  ADCA to ADAA samples. This proves that not only inter facial  defect pass iv ation but also inter facial energy band alignment  can be modulated via tuning the steric hindrance of modifiers  and accordingly inter facial chemical interaction strength. The  large steric hindrance hindered the electron transfer from AD  to   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and the small steric hindrance was favorable for the  electron transfer from ADAA to   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . Therefore, it is neces­ sary to consider the spatial conformation of a molecule when  \n\nwe developed organic molecules to modify interface. PL map­ ping results in Figure   $\\mathrm{5d-g}$   also confirmed gradually improved  charge extraction at perovskite/  $'\\mathrm{SD}_{2}$   interface from AD,  ADCA to ADAA. Transient photo current (TPC) and transient  photo voltage (TPV) techniques were used to study inter facial  charge extraction and recombination processes. As shown in  Figure 5h, the TPC result shows that AD (3.08), ADCA (1.85),  and ADAA   $(1.69~\\ensuremath{\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}})$   modified devices had a shorter carrier  extraction lifetime than the control device   $(3.76~\\ensuremath{\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}})$  , proving  ameliorated inter facial charge extraction and transfer due to  improved inter facial energy level alignment, which agrees with  TRPL results. The TPV result in Figure 5i shows that the car­ rier lifetime of the control device was enhanced from 3.69 to   $3.84\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   of the device with AD,   $4.15~\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   of the device with ADCA,  and  $4.31\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{s}$   of the device with ADAA, which demonstrated sup­ pressed inter facial non radiative recombination. Figure 5j plots  the open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$   change depending on light inten­ sity for the control and modified PSCs. It is well known that  when the ideality factor   $(n)$   is close to 1, the device is close to  a “perfect device” with negligible bimolecular recombination.  The   $n$   values of the AD, ADCA, and ADAA modified devices  were 1.50, 1.42, and 1.21, respectively, which are much lower  than 1.66 of the control device, certifying inhibited nonradia­ tive recombination after interface regulation. Electrochemical  impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can explain charge transport pro­ cesses inside devices. Figure 5k shows the Nyquist plot of PSCs  in the presence or absence of interface molecules, which clearly  revealed gradually reduced charge transfer resistance at high  frequency region and gradually increased charge recombination  resistance at low frequency region both in the order of control,  AD, ADCA, and ADAA based PSCs. The equivalent circuit is  given in Figure S9 (Supporting Information) and fitting param­ eters can be seen in Table  S5 (Supporting Information). The  reduced charge transfer resistance is mainly owing to improved  inter facial energy band alignment and suppressed interfa­ cial non radiative recombination should be mainly ascribed to  reduced inter facial defect densities. The charge separation and  transfer were investigated by performing capacitance–voltage   $(C{-}V)$   measurement to obtain built-in potential   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{bi}}\\right)$  . Through  fitting Mott–Schottky curve in Figure 5l, the   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}\\mathrm{s}$   of the devices  with AD (0.82 ), ADCA (0.83 ), and ADAA   $\\left(0.84~\\mathrm{V}\\right)$   are larger  than the control device (0.81 V). The increased   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   is indicative  of improved carrier separation and transfer, which is consistent  with TRPL, TPC, and EIS results.  \n\nPlanar devices based on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL were fabricated to inves­ tigate the effect of interface modification on photovoltaic per­ formance. As presented in Figures S10–S12 and Tables S6–S8 \n\n (Supporting Information), the optimal concentrations were \n\n 0.5, 0.5, and   $0.3\\,\\mathrm{\\megamL^{-1}}$   for AD, ADCA, and ADAA based  PSCs, respectively. As can be seen from statistical diagrams of  the control and modified devices in  Figure   6 a--d, the PCE was  increased for all modifiers as compared to the control device,  which is mainly as a result of much improved   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and slightly  enhanced short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$  . The improved   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  is mainly due to mitigated inter facial stress and reduced inter­ facial defect density resulting from effective pass iv ation of mod­ ification molecules for the under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   at the bottom  surface of perovskite films and oxygen vacancy defects at the  surface of  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film. The improved energy band alignment and  thus promoted electron extraction should be primarily respon­ sible for slightly enhanced short-circuit current density   $\\left(J_{S C}\\right)$  .  Interestingly, all photovoltaic parameters were enhanced for  ADAA. The average PCE was enhanced from   $20.19\\,\\pm\\,0.473\\%$    of the control device to   $21.31\\,\\pm\\,0.433\\%$  ,   $21.60\\,\\pm\\,0.315\\%$  , and   $22.25\\:\\pm\\:0.239\\%$   of AD, ADCA, and ADAA\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
