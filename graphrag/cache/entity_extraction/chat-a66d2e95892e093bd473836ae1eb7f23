CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

In RP MHPs  that show 2D exciton behaviors, the exciton binding energy can  increase to  $\\mathrm{>}300~\\mathrm{meV},^{[174-177]}$   which is much higher than that  of 3D counterparts   $(40{-}150~\\mathrm{meV}$   for MAPbBr;   $13{-}50~\\mathrm{meV}$   for   $\\mathrm{\\small{MA}P b I_{3}})$  ).  Assuming that all absorbed photons generate  electron–hole pairs, the PLQE   $\\eta$  can be determined by three  different recombination rates: trap-assisted mono molecular  recombination rate   $k_{1}$   (excitonic recombination rate for RP  MHPs), bimolecular recombination rate   $k_{2}$  , and Auger recombination rate  $k_{3}^{~[180]}$  \n\n$$\n\\eta^{^{\\mathrm{3D}}}=\\frac{n k_{2}}{k_{1}+n k_{2}\\,+n^{2}k_{3}}\\,\\rightarrow\\,\\eta^{^{\\mathrm{2D}}}=\\frac{\\phi k_{1}+n k_{2}}{k_{1}+n k_{2}\\,+n^{2}k_{3}}\n$$  \n\nwhere  $n\\;[\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}]$   is the charge-carrier density and   $\\phi$  is the ratio of  excitonic radiative recombination among all kinds of monomolecular recombination. A recent report calculated that RP MHPs  have much higher recombination rates   $(k_{1}=5\\times10^{7}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  ,  $k_{2}=2\\times$   $10^{-9}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  ,  $\\bar{k}_{3}=2\\times10^{-26}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{6}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$   than 3D MHPs do   $(k_{1}=9\\times$   $10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$  ,   $k_{2}\\,=\\,7\\,\\times\\,10^{-10}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  ,   $\\dot{k}_{3}\\,=\\,3\\,\\times\\,10^{-28}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{6}\\,\\mathrm{\\dot{~}s}^{-1})$  . The higher recombination rates in RP MHPs imply that light  emission is more efficient in RP MHPs, and that it originates from excitonic recombination, as well as bimolecular  recombination, whereas the contribution of Auger recombination at high  $n$   is also larger than that in 3D MHPs. Also, the RP  MHPs undergo an energy-transfer process. After recombination  of injected electrons and holes in RP-phase MHP crystals, but  before quenching, the excitons can be transferred to adjacent  crystals that have higher   $m$  and a smaller bandgap; as a result,  the light is emitted by the crystals that have the highest  m   (Figure 10A).  This energy-transfer process is attributed  to the adjacently positioned RP-phase crystals with different   $m$  , and to very fast energy transfer   $({\\approx}0.5$   ps).  The energy  transfer can be beneficial for EL efficiency because the charge  carriers are more concentrated at the crystals that have the  highest   $m$   and because trap states need to be filled only in the  crystals that have the highest  m .  \n\nRP MHPs can also improve the stability of MHP materials and PeLEDs. RP MHPs have a higher formation energy  than that of their 3D counterparts because of a strong van der  Waals’ force between the large OA groups in RP MHPs, and  they thereby have improved material stability at room temperature.  Also, these large OA groups can suppress ion migration  between 3D MHP multilayer s.  \n\nThe fabrication of RP MHP films is simple; they can be  made by just mixing a large OA with a 3D perovskite precursor  solution, and then spin-coating the mixed solutions. Based on  the advantages (high exciton binding energy, high structural  stability, and simple fabrication process), RP PeLEDs have  been studied to achieve high EL efficiency and high operational  stability.  Infrared PeLEDs that have an RP structure fabricated by mixing   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and phenyl ethyl ammonium  (PEA) iodide showed an   $\\mathrm{EQE}_{\\mathrm{max}}$  of   $8.4\\%$  . In addition, the  absorption spectrum of RP MHP films did not change much  at high   $\\mathrm{RH}=90\\%$   for   $50\\textup{d}$  , whereas the absorption spectrum  of 3D MHP films significantly changed after 7 d (Figure 10B);  this result demonstrates the high stability of RP MHP films in  ambient conditions.  RP infrared PeLEDs based on   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$    and 1-nap h thy l methyl amine iodide (NMAI) showed an   $\\mathrm{EQE}_{\\mathrm{max}}$   of   $11.7\\%$   with an improved operational lifetime. The  operational lifetime of RP PeLEDs was   $L_{50}=2\\mathrm{~h~}$  , which was  much better than that of 3D   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   PeLEDs   $(L_{50}=1\\ \\mathrm{min})$  ).   RP PeLEDs based on NMAI and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   achieved an   $\\mathrm{EQE}_{\\mathrm{max}}$    of   $3.7\\%$   and an operation lifetime of   $L_{50}=5$   h (Figure 10C).   Also, RP MHP films showed higher photo stability than  3D MHP films did.  The PL intensity of RP MHP films  (but yl ammonium-incorporated   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$  ) was quite stable;  it decreased only by  ${\\approx}10\\%$   under irradiation of  ${\\approx}10\\ \\mathrm{mW\\cm^{-2}}$  ,  whereas the PL of 3D MHP films was totally quenched after  only 50 s of irradiation. In contrast, the EL intensity of RP  PeLEDs decreased very rapidly   $(L_{50}~\\approx~80~\\mathrm{~s~}$  s).  RP MHP  films in oct yl ammonium–MA mixed systems also had high  photo stability.  \n\n# 3.3. Suppression of Ion Migration with Additives   and Blocking Layers  \n\nBecause the degradation in PeLEDs is mainly related to electricfield-induced ion migration from MHP emission layers to interfaces and other layers, the suppression of ion migration can  be a very effective method to increase the stability of PeLEDs.  Because ion migration is a temperature-activated process, the  reduction of temperature is the most effective solution, but it is not compatible with practical applications of PeLEDs at  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/f8cd099fb8d413871f5198cc0f774c5fdcc6a751993cd5842adee22ca61cb19e-1723832776.jpg)  \nFigure 10.   A) Schematic illustration showing device structure of an RP PeLED (ITO/Buf-HIL/  $\\mathsf{I}(\\mathsf{P E A})_{2}(\\mathsf{M A})_{m-1}\\mathsf{P b}_{m}\\mathsf{B r}_{3m+1}/\\mathsf{T P B I}/\\mathsf{L i F}/\\mathsf{A l})$   and the energytransfer process between MHP crystals with different  m .
