CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The increased grain size  and improved compactness and smoothness are put down to  suppressed heterogeneous nucleation resulting from enhanced  hydrophobic it y of crystal substrates. Improved morphology  should be conducive to facilitating carrier transport and sup­ pressing charge non radiative recombination.  \n\nThe crystal structure and crystal lin it y of the perovskite layer  were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The diffraction peak  positions and intensities of modified perovskite films did not  change compared with the control films, indicating that the  crystal structure and crystal lin it y were almost not affected by  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/34b551366d18551be8f6db8693d285b62930f5c55e4ba7e2d3ded6b1ab0acb10-1727104857.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   a) XRD patterns of the perovskite films deposited on pristine and modified  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   films with AD, ADCA, and ADAA.

Similar crystal lin it y  and orientation were also demonstrated for control and modi­ fied perovskite films by Grazing wide-angle X-ray scattering  (GIWAXS) in Figure  S5 (Supporting Information). Depthdependent grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) meas­ urements were performed to study the stress distribution of the  control and modified perovskite films. First, we chose varied  incident angles  ω  (  $\\omega=0.3$  , 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, and   $1.5^{\\circ})$  ) to  ensure that the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}/$  perovskite interface could be detected. As  exhibited in Figure 3b–e, the diffraction peaks of all perovskite  films were gradually shifted toward lower angles as the inci­ dent angles increased, which was indicative of the existence of  tensile stress. However, the shift degree gradually reduced in  the order of AD, ADCA, and ADAA as compared to the control  film (Figure  3f). The reduced strain could be due to reduced  inter facial defects and ameliorated inter facial contact.   Since ADAA molecule is the most effective in inter facial defect  healing, the smallest stress was achieved in ADAA-modified  perovskite films among all investigated samples.  \n\nFrom UV–vis absorption spectra in Figure  S6 (Supporting  Information), similar absorption intensity was observed for the  control and modified perovskite films. We measured the steadystate photo luminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved photolumi­ nescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films deposited on  glass substrates. Compared with the control perovskite film, the  PL intensity and carrier lifetimes were enhanced after interface  modification no matter which direction the fluorescence spectra  were tested ( Figure    4 a–d). Nevertheless, much higher carrier  lifetimes can be found upon measuring from glass side as com­ pared to from perovskite side. It suggests that as-used modifiers  can efficaciously passivate the defects at the bottom surface of  perovskite films and suppress trap-assisted non radiative recom­ bination. In the case of glass side, the average carrier lifetime of  perovskite films was increased from 230.74 ns in pristine perov­ skite films to 361.11, 687 .35, and 746.58 ns after AD, ADCA, and  ADAA modification, respectively (Table  S1, Supporting Infor­ mation). Meanwhile, for perovskite side, the average carrier  lifetime (210.08 ns) of the control perovskite film was increased  after the modification of AD (245.01 ns), ADCA (250.34 ns), and  ADAA (276.52 ns) (Table S2, Supporting Information). The PL  mapping result in Figure 4e–h is in good accordance with that  of the above single-point SSPL. Subsequently, the trap density  of the control and modified perovskite films was calculated by  performing the space charge limited current (SCLC) test for the  electron-only devices (Figure 4i–l). The defect density was calcu­ lated as our previous studies.  The trap–filled limit voltage \n\n  $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$   of the control device was   $0.49\\,\\mathrm{~V},$   which was reduced to \n\n 0.39, 0.35, and   $0.33\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$  for the AD, ADCA, and ADAA modi­ fied devices, respectively. Much lower defect densities were  obtained in the AD   $(6.78\\times10^{15})$  , ADCA   $(6.09\\times10^{15})$  , and ADAA   $(5.74\\,\\times\\,10^{15}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})$  ) modified perovskite films than the control  perovskite film   $(8.52\\,\\times\\,10^{15}\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})$  . The above PL and SCLC  results show that AD, ADCA, and ADAA interface molecules  can effectively passivate the defects at the bottom surface and/or  GBs of perovskite films. Moreover, the defect pass iv ation effect  was gradually increased from AD, ADCA to ADAA, which is  positively correlated with chemical interaction strengths. Both  defect pass iv ation effect and chemical interaction strengths are  negatively correlated with the steric hindrance of the chemical  interaction between   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   in modifiers and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  . In a word,  tunable defect pass iv ation effect was achieved by modulating  the steric hindrance of modification molecules and thus inter­  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/09689c04152de201a5a95e480a13d41a35099ab2bc523a6e35c5f089739cc9cf-1727104876.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   a,c) PL and b,d) TRPL spectra of the perovskite films deposited on glass substrates without and with modifier.

Certainly, increased car­ rier lifetimes and reduced defect density are partially attributed  to slightly enlarged grain size and improved morphology.  \n\nUV–vis absorption spectra of the  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   films without and with  AD, ADCA, and ADAA modification are shown in Figure   $S7a$    (Supporting Information). The band gaps of the control and  modified   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   films were   $4.02\\;\\mathrm{\\eV}$  (Figure  S7b, Supporting  Information). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)  \n\nmeasurements were used to investigate the effect of inter facial  modification on the energy levels of perovskite films (Figure S8,  Supporting Information). Conduction band minimum (CBM)  and valence band maximum (VBM) were obtained based on  our previous reports.  As exhibited in Table S3 (Supporting  Information), VBM values of the control   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film was shifted  up from  $-8.76$   to  − 8.73,  $-8.69$  , and   $-8.61\\,\\mathrm{eV}$   for the AD-, ADCA-,  and ADAA-modified films, respectively. At the same time,  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/0dec52511e5a405e7cd92c0ff721df0e61dcf67d54f2deedc3dcb5e09fa25e5a-1727104839.jpg)  \nFigure   5.   a) Energy level diagram of device components. b) SSPL, c) TRPL spectra, and\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
