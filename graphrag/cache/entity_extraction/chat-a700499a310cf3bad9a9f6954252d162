CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

As shown  in Table  1 and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, the  thermo grav i metric analysis (TGA) reveals nearly the same  decomposition temperatures  $\\left(T_{\\mathrm{d}}\\mathrm{s}\\right)$   of MPA-BTI   $(432\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   and MPABTTI   $(431~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  . However, the differential scanning calorimetry \n\n (DSC) shows clearly distinct thermal properties of two HTMs \n\n (see Figure 3c). For MPA-BTI, a low glass transition temperatures   $(T_{\\mathrm{g}})$   of   $86~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is detected during the second heating scan,  followed by an exothermic peak at  ${\\approx}200\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   as well as a melting  temperature approaching   $250~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . While for MPA-BTTI, only  a   $T_{\\mathrm{g}}$   of   $256~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is observed, higher than that of MPA-BTI and  even much higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD   $(121~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  .  The  good thermal stability and high   $T_{\\mathrm{g}}$   of MPA-BTTI is essential  for device fabrication and shelf-life stability of PVSCs, particularly in inverted architecture where perovskite is deposited on  top of the HTM and then annealed at elevated temperature. In  addition, surface wet t ability of these novel HTMs was investigated because a relatively hydrophobic surface can facilitate  the growth of high-quality perovskite poly crystalline films as  well as preclude water permeation.  The contact angle measurements reveal that MPA-BTI has a modest contact angle of \n\n  $59.1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   to water droplet, which is higher than both PEDOT:PSS \n\n  $(16.9\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   and Spiro-OMeTAD   $(38.7\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})^{[23]}$   (see Figure S6 in the  Supporting Information). More encouragingly, MPA-BTTI possesses a much larger angle of   $83.8~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , and therefore a greatly  increased hydrophobic it y compared to MPA-BTI.  \n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) was then performed to  examine the surface morphology of both HTMs. As shown in  Figure S7 in the Supporting Information, MPA-BTTI exhibits  a smoother and more homogeneous surface with a root-meansquare roughness   $(R_{\\mathrm{q}})$   of   $0.44~\\mathrm{nm}$   compared to MPA-BTI with  an   $R_{\\mathrm{q}}$   of   $0.96\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . Moreover, the molecular ordering of both  HTMs in bulk thin films was investigated by 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS; Figure S8,  Supporting Information). Both SM-HTMs show a weak   $\\pi{-}\\pi$  stacking peak either along the out-of-plane direction or in-plane  direction, indicating nearly amorphous nature of the MPA-BTI  and MPA-BTTI pristine films. Nevertheless, it was found that  superior film uniformity and morphological stability could be  even more important than hole mobility in determining device  performance of PVSCs.  Based on space charge-limited current (SCLC) method, the hole mobility of neat MPA-BTI film  is determined to be   $3.99\\times10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   which is comparable to that   $(2.13\\times10^{-5}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$   of the widely used SpiroOMeTAD.  Encouragingly, MPA-BTTI shows a much higher  hole mobility of   $2.02\\,\\times\\,\\dot{1}0^{-4}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$   despite of its amorphous character (Table 1; Figure S9, Supporting Information),  which is in good agreement with the trend of the calculated   $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{h}}$   values. Similarly, the measured conductivity of undoped  MPA-BTTI film is higher than that of MPA-BTI   $(1.35\\times10^{-5}$   vs   $6.90\\times10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{S\\cm^{-1}}$  ; Table 1; Figure S10, Supporting Information), which is comparable to that of undoped Spiro-OMeTAD   $(\\approx\\!10^{-5}\\:\\mathrm{~S~}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  .  Thus, pristine MPA-BTTI film possesses  promising hole-transporting capacity, which favorably allows it  to function as an effective HTM in PVSCs without extra doping  process.  \n\nTo evaluate the device performance of these two small mole­ cules as dopant-free HTMs in inverted perovskite solar cells,  the widely used device configuration of ITO/SM-HTMs/perovskite/  ${\\sf C}_{60/}$  bath o cup roi ne   $(\\mathrm{BCP})/\\mathrm{Ag}$  was adopted ( Figure    4 a).  The active perovskite layer with mixed   $C s^{+}$  ,   $\\mathrm{H}C(\\mathrm{NH})_{2}{}^{+}$  , and   ${\\mathrm{CH}}_{3}{\\mathrm{NH}}_{3}{}^{+}$   cations (CsFAMA for simplicity) was prepared using  the one-step anti solvent method,  while the SM-HTMs  were optimized by varying concentrations in toluene and  annealing temperatures. It was found that the concentration  of   $3.5~\\mathrm{mg~mL^{-1}}$   in toluene (for both MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI),  and thermal annealing at 80 and   $110~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for MPA-BTI and MPABTTI, respectively, yielded the optimal conditions to achieve the  best device performance (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Figure  4c displays the current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   curves  for the optimal devices under the standard AM 1.5G illumination, and the corresponding data are summarized in  Table    2 .  The MPA-BTI-based device achieved an encouraging PCE of   $17.20\\%$   with a   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $21.58\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.09, and an FF  of   $73.14\\%$  , and the device also showed a small hysteresis with  a PCE of   $16.72\\%$   for the forward scan. The MPA-BTTI-based  device yielded an astonishingly high PCE of   $21.17\\%$   with a  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$    of   $23.23\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.12, and an FF of   $81.35\\%$  . More  importantly, there is a negligible hysteresis during the forward  scan, yielding a PCE of   $21.02\\%$   with a   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $23.26~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.12, and an FF of   $80.60\\%$  . The corresponding external  quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Figure  4e,  which lead to integrated current densities of 20.75 and  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/f792d26f1e6fc746f7aad187a842d6a37dc22b977979fa813c5d4aa7c6d04851-1723834417.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $\\mathsf{p-i-n}$   (inverted) configuration.  b) Cross-section SEM images of the MPA-BTTI-based PVSCs. c) The  J – V  curves of the best performing MPA-BTI\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
