CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

However,  high-temperature sintering process (usually over   $500\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ) required for preparing  mesoporous   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   films complicates device  fabrication and increases energy consumption and thus device cost, which is  incompatible with the fabrication of flexible PSCs. In order to overcome the above  issues, low-temperature normal  and  inverted  planar PSCs were developed  considering the long carrier diffusion  length of commonly utilized perovskite  compositions.  \n\nChemical interaction at a he t ero junction interface induced by an appropriate  chemical linker is of crucial importance for high efficiency, hysteresis-less,  and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Effective interface engineering in  PSCs is reported via a multi functional chemical linker of 4-imi daz ole acetic  acid hydrochloride (ImAcHCl) that can provide a chemical bridge between   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and perovskite through an ester bond with  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   via esterification  reaction and an electrostatic interaction with perovskite via i mid a zo liu m  cation in ImAcHCl and iodide anion in perovskite. In addition, the  chloride anion in ImAcHCl plays a role in the improvement of crystal lin it y  of perovskite film crystal lin it y. The introduction of ImAcHCl onto  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$    realigns the positions of the conduction and valence bands upwards,  reduces non radiative recombination, and improves carrier life time. As a  consequence, average power conversion efficiency (PCE) is increased from   $18.60\\%\\pm0.50\\%$   to   $20.22\\%\\pm0.34\\%$   before and after surface modification,  respectively, which mainly results from an enhanced voltage from \n\n  $1.084\\pm0.012\\,\\lor$   to   $1.143\\pm0.009\\,\\lor.$  . The best PCE of  $\\mathbf{\\lambda_{21\\%}}$   is achieved by \n\n  $\\pmb{0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}$   ImAcHCl treatment, along with negligible hysteresis. Moreover,  an un encapsulated device with ImAcHCl-modified  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   shows much better  thermal and moisture stability than unmodified   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  .  \n\nFor low-temperature normal planar  PSCs, developing low-temperature highquality ETMs are crucial to realize high  PCE. Based on this consideration, several effective ETMs have been attempted  and optimized in planar PSCs, such as   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  ,    $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  ,    $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  ,  PCBM,  and  so on. Among them,   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETM as a  promising alternative to   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   possesses  \n\nPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing organic–inorganic  metal halide hybrid per ovsk ites as light-harvesting materials have received amazing attention due to high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost solution-process able  procedure,  since a PCE of   $9.7\\%$   was achieved based on  solid-state PSCs using solid spiro-MeOTAD hole transporting  material (HTM) (  $\\mathrm{\\langle\\sim\\!-\\!M e O T A D}~=~2{,}2^{\\prime}{,}7{,}7^{\\prime}$  -tetrakis( N , N -di $p$  -meth oxy phenyl amine)-9,9 ′ -spiro bif luo rene).  Recent technologies can lead to a certified PCE of   $24.2\\%$  ,  including  perovskite film quality optimization, additive engineering,  interface engineering, and device structure engineering. To  date, to the best of our knowledge, efficient PSCs with the PCE  exceeding   $22\\%$   were fabricated based on mesoporous n–i–p  \n\nseveral appealing advantages, including wide optical bandgap   $(3.6{-}4.0~\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   beneficial for protecting UV-degradation, high  bulk electron mobility (up to   $240\\bar{\\mathrm{~cm}^{2}}\\mathrm{~V}^{-1}\\bar{\\mathrm{~s}^{-1}})$  , good band  alignment with per ovsk ites, low-temperature process ability,  and excellent chemical stability.  Consequently,   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETM  shows huge potentials in simultaneously achieving efficient  and stable planar PSCs. To date, the PCEs over   $21\\%$   have been  reported for   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -planar PSCs based on optimization of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  film quality,  improvement of perovskite film quality,  and  interface engineering.  In the past few years, various deposition methods have been developed to prepare high-quality   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   film, such as solution process deposition,  atomic  layer deposition (ALD),  chemical bath deposition (CBD), electrochemical deposition,  pulsed laser deposition (PLD), etc. Particularly, solution process deposition from commercial   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano particle colloidal dispersion solution attracts extensive attention because of high PCE and simple fabrication  procedure.  Most recently, a certified PCE up to   $23.3\\%$  was reported based on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -planar PSCs adopting commercial   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano particle as ETM.  \n\nAlthough great progress has been made on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -planar  PSCs, the presently achieved PCE (over   $23\\%$  ) is still far from  the theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit efficiency   $(30.5\\%)$  ,  which is mainly ascribed to trap-assisted non radiative recombination in perovskite films and at the interface.  Except for  PCE, trap-assisted non radiative recombination is also closely  related to the device stability and hysteresis.  In order to further enhance the PCE and stability of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based planar PSCs,  some strategies like inter facial engineering have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the non radiative recombination losses in perovskite films.  Considering the significant  effect of interface recombination on PCE, stability, and hysteresis in PSCs, great efforts have been contributed to investigating and optimizing the perovskite/HTM interface   and perovskite/ETM interface.  Regarding the perovskite/ ETM interface, most of the works were focused on   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}/$  perovskite interface instead of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2.}$  /perovskite interface.   Therefore, it is highly desirable to increase the device PCE and  stability via rational modification of the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2I}$  /perovskite interface. For example, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) (3-amino prop yl trie th oxys i lane (3-APTES),  and 4-pyr i dine carboxylic  acid   $(\\mathrm{PA})^{[27]})$   formed on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   led to improved PCE. Recently,  a PCE of   $21.43\\%$   was obtained by modification of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   with  a z witter ionic compound (3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propane sulfonate),  which resulted in an improved PCE and thermal stability.   Additionally, Bu et  al. incorporated a KOH pass iv ation layer  at   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/}$  perovskite interface in planar PSCs, which facilitated  perovskite grain growth and passivated the interface defects.   The above successful examples strongly indicate that inter facial  engineering with multi functional interface modifiers is imperative\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
