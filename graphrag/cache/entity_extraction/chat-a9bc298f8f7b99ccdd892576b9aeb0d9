CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Under a small grazing incidence, the spot was elongated into a  line on the sample surface in the longitudinal direction. By moving the  sample laterally, the diffraction from different areas of the film could be  measured. Eight lines were measured, and the step of each movement  was  $\\approx\\!1.5~\\mathsf{m m}$   and was controlled by a precision motor. 2D XRD patterns  were acquired by a MarCCD X-ray detector at a distance of   ${\\approx}263\\ \\mathsf{m m}$  from the sample, with an exposure time of   $20~s$  . A grazing incidence  angle of   $0.40^{\\circ}$   was adopted. The XRD patterns were analyzed using  the FIT2D software and displayed in scattering vector  $q$   coordinates. The  optical absorption, transmission, and reflection spectra of the perovskite  films were measured by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer  (SHIMADZU UV-1750). Photo luminescence spectra were measured by  using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600). Devices were  excited by a   $500\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   pulsed diode laser. Time-resolved PL spectra were  collected by using an FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments).  Surface topographies (AFM) were imaged using an atomic force  microscope (Keysight 5500). XPS was done using Al   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  (1486.61  eV)  X-rays and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. The factor analysis  of the XPS spectra was performed using the program XPSPEAK ver. 4.1.  The TRPL mapping (FLIM) was measured by using a laser scanning  confocal microscope (SouthPort, JadeMAT) with a   $100~\\times~{\\mathsf{N A0.9}}$  objective. The detection system consisted of a VIS to NIR PMT detector,  which has an IRF within 180  ps and a 1-AU pinhole. Meanwhile, a   $520\\;\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$   pulsed laser was used with an 80 ps pulse width as the  light source and tuned to   $500~\\mathrm{~kHz}$   while performing the mapping  measurements. A time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)  system with the lowest time resolution of 4  ps was used. The  measurement of activation energy of ion migration was conducted in a  Lakeshore probe station under a vacuum   $(\\mathsf{I}.\\mathsf{I}\\times\\mathsf{I}0^{-4}~\\mathsf{P a})$  . The samples  were placed on a copper substrate with the temperature controlled by a  heater and then liquid He was injected. A semiconductor characterization  system (Keithley 4200-SCS) was used for the current measurement. The  current was extracted at   $\\rceil50\\ s$   after the voltage was switched on. During  the measurement, the devices were first cooled to  $\\daleth0~\\mathsf{K}$   for  $\\rceil\\textsf{h}$   and then  heated to the objective temperature. Every objective temperature was  stabilized for 5 min before the current recording.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nW.H., Y.Y., and Q.X. contributed equally to this work.
