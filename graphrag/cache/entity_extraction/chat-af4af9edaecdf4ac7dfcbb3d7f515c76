CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2OâZr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZrÂ·OH+OHÂ·ZrâÂ·ZrÂ·OÂ·ZrÂ·+H2O\nZrÂ·OC4H9+HOÂ·ZrâÂ·ZrÂ·OÂ·ZrÂ·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

Besides, thiophene based   $\\pi$  spacer is  employed to keep the molecular planarity and enhance intramolecular  $\\pi{-}\\pi$  interaction due to the small resonance energy of  thienyl segment, which is considered to suppress the thermal  decomposition of OTG molecules under high-temperature  annealing process.   Figure Â  1 a shows the chemical structures  of three such molecules. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations  demonstrated that a large 2,4-dibutoxy phenyl unit applied  in OTG3 could efficiently hinder the octahedral tilting of the  corner-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   black phase through a strong sterichindrance effect. Such effect increases the formation energy of  ortho rhombi c yellow phase with an edge-sharing   $[\\mathrm{PbI_{6}}]^{4-}$   structure. Moreover, the fact that the carboxyl ate group on OTG  molecules passivated the surface   $\\mathrm{{Pb}}^{0}$   defects further reduced  the non radiative recombination of charge carriers in perovskite  layer.  Consequently, the stable power conversion efficiency of  PSCs with a surface organic capping layer reached   $13.2\\%$   for  the inverted planar structure. More importantly,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   PSCs  with an OTG3 capping layer showed much higher phase stability against moisture than did the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   devices.  The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device retained   $85\\%$   of its initial PCE after  aging for 30 days in ambient air without encapsulation. These  results emphasize the importance of regulating lattice distortion to produce efficient and stable all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   PSCs.  \n\nOTG1, OTG2, and OTG3 molecules were synthesized by  procedures described in our previous reports,  the steps of  synthesis are shown in Figure S1a (Supporting Information).  Figure S1b (Supporting Information) provides the thermograv i metric analysis (TGA) of OTG1, OTG2, and OTG3. All  the samples exhibit negligible weight loss associated with the  decomposition or thermal evaporation of OTG molecules from  20 to   $200\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , indicating their good thermal stability for the  application of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   based devices. The surface pass iv ation  process of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   perovskite was conducted by adding OTG  molecules to a perovskite precursor solution composed of CsI  and   $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$  . The perovskite black phase was formed after a onestep spin-coating procedure and gradient thermal annealing at  90 and   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . The formation of the black phase was attributed  to the fact that the  $\\mathrm{H}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   intermediate could facilitate transition  to the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   black phase at lower temperature than that of the  traditional method used CsI and  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   as precursor.  Details of  the process are provided in the experimental section. Figure S2  (Supporting Information), which shows the XRD pattern of  pristine  $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$   powder used in perovskite precursor, depicts the  strong peaks at  $11.7^{\\circ}$  ,  $25.9^{\\circ}$  , and   $31.3^{\\circ}$   associated with the (100), \n\n (201), and (310) planes, respectively, of the   $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$   crystal.  \n\nIn order to verify the presence of OTG molecules in the \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   film after thermal annealing process, we re dissolved  the perovskite films in d6-DMSO solvent for nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) measurement,   $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$   NMR spectrums of the  relative samples are plotted in FigureÂ  1b. The corresponding  peaks in  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  âOTG samples are assigned to the H atoms presented on cyano acetic acid   $(8.4{-}8.5\\ \\mathrm{ppm})$  ), thiophene   $\\pi$  spacer   $(7.7{-}8.0\\ \\mathrm{ppm})$  , phenyl unit   $(6.7{-}7.5\\ \\mathrm{ppm})$  ), and the bulk alkyl  chain   $(0.9{-}4.2\\,\\mathrm{\\pmm})$  , respectively. Besides, some works indicate that   $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$   precursor may introduce extra organic cations  called dimethyl ammonium (DMA) into the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite  lattice.  However, the   $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$   NMR peaks at 8.2 and 2.7Â  ppm  assigned to the amino   $\\left({-\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{H}_{2}}^{+}\\right)$   and methyl   $\\left(\\mathrm{-CH}_{3}\\right)$   groups  of DMA cation   $\\scriptstyle(^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\ \\mathrm{NMR}$   of DMAI is shown in Figure S3 in  the Supporting Information), respectively, are absent in our  perovskite samples. Based on this result, we deduce that the  perovskite film fabricated by this work is all-inorganic rather  than the organicâinorganic hybrid one. Additionally, we employ  time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS)  analysis (FigureÂ  1c) to investigate the vertical distribution of  OTG molecules (indicated by  $\\mathrm{CN^{-}}$  ) in   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   film (indicated by  â PbI ), which indicates that OTG molecules mainly serve as a  surface organic capping layer on the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite.  \n\nThe coordinated reaction between the carboxyl ate   $\\scriptstyle(\\mathrm{O=C-O}\\rangle$  )  of OTG molecules and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   perovskite was demonstrated  via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Figure   $S4\\mathrm{a}$    (Supporting Information) shows the FTIR spectra of OTG moleÂ­ cules and the CsPbI 3 âOTG mixture. The stretching vibration of  the   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   bond in pure OTG3 was observed at   $1685~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  . The   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   vibration was shifted to a lower wavenumber of   $1671\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$    in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   mixture. The other peaks presented in  1260, 1302, 1425, and   $1579~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   are relative to the vibration  signal of Ar î H,   $_{\\mathsf{C-O-C}}$  ,   $_{\\mathrm{C-H}}$  , and   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$   bonds in the OTG  molecules. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  analysis further confirms the coordination between carboxyl ate  and   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   cations, as shown in Figure S4b (Supporting Information). The XPS O 1s spectrum revealed three clear peaks at \n\n  $529.4~\\mathrm{eV}$     $\\mathrm{(Pb-O}$   bond),   $531.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   $\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$   bond), and   $532.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   \n\n (\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
