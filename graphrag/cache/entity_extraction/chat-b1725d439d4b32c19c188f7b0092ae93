CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The signal at the input was simultaneously  integrated, amplified, low-pass filtered, and converted from analog to  digital with a 12 bit converter. Noise produced by the external readout  electronics detector panel was characterized by taking dark images  without and with sensor. To eliminate fixed detector noise, dark images  were subtracted. The mean value and the standard deviation were  calculated from a region of interest. The standard deviation presents the  electronic noise in numbers of electrons. X-ray image from objects were  offset compensated by subtracting a dark image and flat-field corrected  by calculating the gain factor of each pixel. The MTF was determined by  the slanted-edge method. First a tungsten material with a sharp edge  was placed on the scintilla tor and the edge profile was derived from  the resulting X-ray image. The line spread function (LSF) was derived  by differentiating the edge profile. The MTF value was defined by the  Fourier transform of LSF.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis study was supported by the National Research Foundation of  Korea (NRF) under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning  (Basic Science Research Program (No.2014 R 1 A 5 A 1009799), NanoMaterial Technology Development Program (No. 2017 M 3 A 7 B 4041696),  the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Change   (No. 2015 M 1 A 2 A 2055631), and Global Frontier R&D Program on Center  for Multiscale Energy System (No. 2012 M 3 A 6 A 7054855).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ncesium lead tribromide, nano crystals, perovskite, scintilla tors, X-ray  imaging  \n\nReceived: March 18, 2018 Revised: May 28, 2018 Published online:  \n\n[4]\t C. Szeles,  Phys.
