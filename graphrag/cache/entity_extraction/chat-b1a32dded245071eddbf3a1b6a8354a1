Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

Pioneering research works on  this class of material can be dated back to  more than 10 years ago, when organic– inorganic metal halide per ovsk ites are  used as visible-light sensitize rs for dyesensitized solar cells.  However, due  to the low efficiency (less than   $4\\%$  ) and  poor stability of the liquid electrolyte– based devices, a limited number of  investigations were reported for a long  time. Importantly in 2012, the introduction of solid hole transport materials to  replace the liquid electrolyte in film solar  cells bloomed the explosion to ground  for an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching about   $20\\%$  .  The  recently reported efficiency with a champion value up to   $23\\%$   and a reproducible  photovoltaic performance further indicate  the great potential of perovskite materials  in future applications.  \n\nMetal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), with excellent optical properties  and spectacular characteristics of direct and tunable bandgaps, strong  light-absorption coefficients, high defect tolerance, and low non radiative  recombination rates, are highly attractive for modern op to electronic devices.  However, the stability issue of PQDs remains a critical challenge of this newly  emerged material despite the recent rapid progress. Here, the encapsulation  strategies to improve the stability of PQDs are comprehensively reviewed.  A special emphasis is put on the effects of encapsulation, ranging from  the improvement of chemical stability, to the inhibition of light-induced  decomposition, to the enhancement of thermal stability. Particular attention is  devoted to summarizing the encapsulation approaches, including the sol–gel  method, the template method, physical blending, and micro encapsulation. The  selection principles of encapsulation materials, including the rigid lattice or  porous structure of inorganic compounds, the low penetration rate of oxygen  or water, as well as the swelling–deswelling process of polymers, are addressed  systematically. Special interest is put on the applications of the encapsulated  PQDs with improved stability in white light-emitting diodes, lasers, and  biological applications. Finally, the main challenges in encapsulating PQDs and  further investigation directions are discussed for future research to promote  the development of stable metal halide perovskite materials.  \n\nThe metal halide perovskite with  a cubic structure analogous to oxide  perovskite is generally described by the  chemical formula of   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$     $(\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Cl})$  , Br, or I),  where A and B are monovalent as   $C s^{+}$  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nand   ${\\mathrm{CH}}_{3}{\\mathrm{NH}}_{3}{}^{+}$   (MA) or  ${\\mathrm{CH}}({\\mathrm{NH}}_{2})_{2}^{+}$   (FA) and divalent cations as   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   or   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$  , respectively. The X is a monovalent halide anion  such as  $C\\mathrm{l^{-}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$  ,  $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$  , and   $\\mathrm{CN^{-}}$  . The A ions in larger radius  occupy the vertexes of cavity, while B and X ions assemble into  corner-sharing octahedra   $\\mathrm{[BX_{6}}^{4-}\\mathrm{]}$   in the center of the framework  formed by cations ions.  Usually, materials with   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   composition can adapt different crystal structures depending on the  size and interaction of the A cation and the corner-sharing BX6  octahedra. In general, Goldsmith's tolerance factor about 0.9–1  is a reliable empirical index to give a good prediction for the  metal halide perovskite with cubic structure.  Compared  with the rigid and thermally stable nature of perovskite oxides,  the halide metal perovskite is rather different. On the basis of  the first principles within density functional theory (DFT), the  formation energy of halide metal perovskite is definitely much  lower than those identified for a series of perovskite oxides.  The metal halide per ovsk ites show relative low melting points  caused by a large inter atomic distance in crystal structure. The  crystal of metal halide perovskite always displays a predominantly ionic lattice with high-concentration   $(>\\!0.4\\%)$   vacancies  or defects, mainly composed of grain boundaries, dislocations,  \n\nMetal halide per ovsk ites have rapidly emerged as an unprecedented class of semiconductors with excellent op to electronic  \n\nstacking faults, and twin planes at room temperature.   Nevertheless, these vacancies reside in the valence or conduct  band acting as shallow defects benign for the original energy  states. The rare situation wherein intrinsic defects do not  act as electronic trap states results in the so-called defect  tolerance.  Therefore, the optical and electronic properties  of metal halide perovskite are highly tolerant to the structural  defects in crystal. Most inorganic and organic inorganic  hybrid halide perovskite compounds show direct and tunable  bandgaps, strong light-absorption coefficients, and excellent  luminescence properties, representing a rising star of optoelectronic materials.  \n\nInherited from the metal halide perovskite, the metal halide  perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) possess both high synthetic  fe a sibi li ties and good optical luminescence with spectacular  defect-tolerant  op to electronic  properties.   Conspicuously optical advantages include impressive ultrahigh   $100\\%$    photo luminescence efficiencies, extremely narrow-band emission, broad emission spectra tunability, and short radiative  lifetimes.  Moreover, the dangling bonds on the surface of PQDs do not affect severely the mid-gap trap states,  which is greatly beneficial for the efficient radiative emissions. Meanwhile, the easy access to a tunable emission via a  one-pot method is also an obvious advantage of PQDs, which  is favorable for application.  By an easy ligand-mediated  method at room temperature (RT), the synthesized PQDs  display uniformly cubic morphology and excellent optical  properties with tunable emission, large optical absorption  cross section, long carrier diffusion length, and high carrier  mobility.  Therefore, these unique op to electronic characters  and easy synthesis approaches of PQDs open up revolutionary  advances in modern op to electronic and photovoltaic devices.  \n\nHowever, the PQDs generally suffer from chemical, photo,  or thermal instability problems because of their ionic structure and large surface energy; the remaining bottleneck of  PQDs for implementation on industrial scale is the longterm stability.  Therefore, improving the stability of PQDs  has become a hot topic of current studies.  Owing to the  high defect tolerance of perovskite crystals, the surface states  cannot interfere the intragap states for varied photo physical  properties.  Thus, various surface pass iv ation strategies have  been proposed to improve the stability of PQDs while ensuring  the cleanliness of energy bandgap and the bright PL during the  past years, including the codoping or hybridizing the other cations, surface pass iv ation using static coordination compounds,  and encapsulation by extra materials.  The codoping or  hybridizing the other cations based on the crystal modification  view and Goldsmith's tolerance factor theory were certified to  enhance the intrinsic stability of PQDs to some extent; however, these PQDs with modified structure still showed lower  melting points easily to sinter for no change of original crystal  structure.  Surface modification methods usually use more  static coordination compounds to strengthen the ligand binding  or some special ways to inter digit ate the octadecene molecules.  X-ray irradiation and tri methyl aluminum were also employed to  inhibit the dynamic activities on the surface of PQDs to enhance  their stability.  Usually, the surface pass iv ation strategies prevent PQDs closely contacting with others in colloidal  states; however, the intrinsic d is solubility equilibrium as the  \n\nWenzhen Lv  received her  Ph.D. degree in inorganic  chemistry from the  Changchun Institute of  Applied Chemistry.
