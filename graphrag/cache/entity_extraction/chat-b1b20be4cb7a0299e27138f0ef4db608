CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The thermal decomposition of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi starts at   ${\\approx}370\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (the extrapolated onset temperature is   $T_{\\mathrm{{o}}}\\,=\\,340~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{{C}})$  ),  which is much higher than those for   $(\\mathrm{C_{4}N_{2}H_{14}X})_{4}\\mathrm{SnX_{6}}$   (  $\\mathrm{(X=Br,}$   $\\mathrm{I)}^{[8]}$   as well as the typical   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$   halide per ovsk ites, indicating  the better thermal stability for the all-inorganic  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  .  \n\nTo gain more information on the photo physical properties  of Bi-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}.$  , UV–vis absorption and PL spectroscopy  were taken under ambient atmosphere and are presented in  Figure   2 . The pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   shows a sharp optical absorption edge at   $315\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   (  $3.93\\,\\mathrm{\\eV},$  , black line in Figure 2a), con- sistent with the previous report with an excitonic absorption  at   $3.9\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   (  $(317\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  .  Upon bismuth incorporation, besides  the absorption band edge by host   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  , there is an additional absorption peak at around   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$     $(3.10\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}})$   (inset to  Figure 2a), which would be assigned to the transitions from the  defect band (i.e., the new valence band maximum consisting  of   $\\mathrm{Cl}\\;3\\mathrm{p}$   and Bi 6s orbitals, VBM ′ ) to the host conduction band  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/65b898128da29d8ea036e6db47888fc5a72ea50b3a8a89a414536f60724e6191-1723824433.jpg)  \nFigure 2.  $\\mathsf{o f C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{\\cdot}x\\mathsf{B i}$  .

It should be noted the increased Bi doping concentrations led to stronger absorption of this additional absorption  peak between 360 and   $400\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nSimilar to the absorption, the PL excitation (PLE) spectra  also showed peaks between 320 and   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . For photoluminescence upon excitation at   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 2b), the emission  spectra of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi showed a peak around   $454~\\mathrm{nm}$   with  a wide FWHM of   $66~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   and a large Stokes shift of   $90\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  .  In sharp contrast, the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   showed no photoluminescence even at stronger excitation intensity. PLE spectra  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi at   $454\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   are plotted by dashed red curve in  Figure 2b. Notably, there is a sharp dip below   $310~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  , where  light is fully absorbed by the host and does not excite the luminescent centers. In this region, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   exhibits a sharp  peak in the absorption spectrum. This means that there is no  energy transfer between the host and the luminescent centers.  We surmise that the intrinsic non radiative transitions caused by  the strong relaxation and vibration led to the strong energy dissipation to the host   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}.$  , so the energy is not transferred  to Bi. Such result is similar to the case of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{Cs}_{4}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{6}$    matrix.  As for the wide emission and large Stokes shift,  we hypothesize the reason as self-trapped exciton, in analogy  to typically observed broadband photo luminescence in 0D  and corrugated-2D metal halide per ovsk ites.  For a halide  perovskite with polar iz able lattice, photo generated excitons  often cause the transient deformation of crystal lattice and are  thus localized, forming the so-called self-trapped excitons. This  elastic lattice distortion changes the nuclear coordinate and dissipates some energy from exciton, leading to broadband emission with large Stokes shift.  \n\nWe further studied PLQY values for the as-synthesized   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi powder. The PLQY was directly measured by FLS980  spec tro flu ori meter with an integrating sphere and excitation  light at  $365\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  . The PLQY was calculated by following formula  \n\n$$\n\\eta=\\left(\\int L_{\\mathrm{direct}}-\\int L_{\\mathrm{bulk}}\\right)/\\left(\\int E_{\\mathrm{without}}-\\int E_{\\mathrm{direct}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\eta$  is the photo luminescent quantum yield,   $L_{\\mathrm{direct}}$   is the  complete emission spectrum of the sample collected by using  the integrating sphere,   $L_{\\mathrm{black}}$   is the emission spectrum of the  blank sample,   $E_{\\mathrm{direct}}$  is the emission spectra of the excitation  light, recorded with the sample in place, and   $E_{\\mathrm{without}}$   is the  emission spectrum of excitation light, recorded with the equipment blank in place. The part   $(\\bar{L_{\\mathrm{direct}}}\\,-\\,\\int\\!L_{\\mathrm{black}})$   expresses the  photons emitted by our sample, and   $(\\int\\!E_{\\mathrm{without}}-\\int\\!E_{\\mathrm{direct}})$   means  the photons emitted by excitation light source. As shown in  Table   1  and  Figure   3 a,   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6};x\\mathrm{Bi}$   with   $x=0.11\\%$  ,   $1.16\\%$  ,  and  $2.75\\%$   showed the PLQY of   $67.6\\%$  ,   $68.3\\%$  , and  $78.9\\%$  . That  is, PLQY grows with the increasing   $x$   in the low   $x$   region. It  should be noted PLQY peaked at a specific   $x=2.75\\%$  , leading  to the highest value of   $78.9\\%$  . When   $_x$   increased further to   $3.39\\%$  ,   $4.18\\%$  , and   $6.63\\%$  , the resulting PLQYs decreased  to   $57.4\\%$  , to   $56.5\\%$  , and to   $38.1\\%$  , respectively. We want to  emphasize that the observed   $78.9\\%$   PLQY here is the highest  one among all lead-free halide per ovsk ites with blue emissions   $(\\mathrm{Cs}_{3}\\mathrm{Pb}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   QDs:   $46\\%$  ,   $\\mathrm{{\\OD\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
