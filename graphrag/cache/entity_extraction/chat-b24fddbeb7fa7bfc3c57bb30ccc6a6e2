CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The large  covering area of color coordinates also indicates great potential  application in vivid wide color gamut displays. Considering the  photo stability and thermo stability are important for practical PL  applications, we put   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composites under continuous  UV-light (emission:   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  ; power: 16 W; window area:   $4\\;\\mathrm{{cm}\\times}$   $19\\ \\mathrm{cm}$  ; irradiation distance:   $15\\ \\mathrm{cm}$  ) irradiation for   $15\\mathrm{~d~}$   to test  their photo stability. Since the network density of polymer  chains may affect the photo stability, the cross linking degree of   $6\\%/12\\%/18\\%$   PS beads was tested in this experiment, respectively. From Figure S8 (Supporting Information) described above,  all composites exhibit better photo stability to some extent compared with bare PQDs. The thermal behavior of the composites  was further studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)  and thermo grav i metric (TG) techniques. As shown in Figure S9  (Supporting Information), the sharp endothermic peak on  $135~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    was observed in the DSC curve (dashed line in blue) that attributed to the glass transition of pure cross linking PS spheres. In  comparison, the glass transition of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composites got  a relative broad temperature range from 100 to   $190~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (solid line  in blue), which suggests that the interaction between PQDs and  PS microspheres greatly influences the thermal movements of  chain segments. Compared with the un cross linked PS latex got a  glass trans is tion temperature at about   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and melting point  of   $270\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ,  the composites present high thermal resistant  property owing to the fact that cross linked PS are infusible.  \n\nDespite numerous efforts in improving stability of perovskite,  the highly luminescent nanohybrid PQDs still quenched most  of their emission when being immersed into water.  In comparison with porous materials, polymer chains encompass the  nano crystals compactly, which endows the composite excellent  water resistant property. We stirred the composite in water for   $3\\ \\mathrm{d}.$  . Then the composite was separated from water by a Büchner  funnel and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature. The  absolute PL QYs of composites were   $64.7\\%$  , while the luminescence of bare nano crystals was completely quenched owing to  irreversible degradation. It is very surprising that the   $\\mathrm{PODs}_{\\mathcal{Q}\\mathrm{PS}}$    composites still emitted strong green luminescence even after  nine-month storage in water. The photo luminescence spectra  were measured to monitor the intensity of fluorescence. It is  worth noting that in order to eliminate the instrumental error  from spectrophotometer, a certain concentration of rhodamine B  aqueous solution was used as reference (stored in dark) for each  measurement. The sample of aqueous solution was sonicated  for   $10\\ \\mathrm{min}$   before testing to ensure the homogeneity. As shown  in  Figure   5 a, the composite remains   $20–30\\%$   intensity of florescence even after   $30\\textup{d}$  of stirring in water according to the different degree of cross linking. The sample with   $12\\%$   cross linking  degree exhibited the best performance for water resistance. It is  surprising that the water resistance of   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composites  demonstrated a size-dependent effect. 400 and 800 nm   $\\operatorname{PODs}(\\emptyset)$  PS beads show rapid luminescence quenching in aqueous solution. This may be attributed to the distribution of PQDs in PS  particles. It is reasonable to speculate a large proportion of  nano crystals located in periphery of small-size PS beads, which  leads to poor waterproof property. In addition, increasing the  dosage of PS making little difference with the loading amount of  PQDs for PS spheres, their PL spectra (Figure S10, Supporting  Information) also show similar water resistant property. Therefore, a large-scale production (about   $6.2~\\mathrm{g}.$  ,  Figure   6 ) with superior water resistant property can be obtained in one batch.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/8201d6fa89aea0f49df6c39df539fc70ff4e8017ab857980ac6bf926a729060a-1727077239.jpg)  \nFigure 6.   a) Preparation of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}\\mathrm{@P S}$   composites in large scale.
