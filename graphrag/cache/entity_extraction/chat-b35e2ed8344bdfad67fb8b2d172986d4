CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is interesting to note that three domain walls intersect each other. SAED patterns taken from  the domains (labeled   $\\textcircled{1}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\circled{3}\\!\\!\\!)$   in the highresolution electron microscopy (HREM)  image [Figure 4b] are given in Figure 4e–g,  respectively. The red arrows in Figure 4 e,f,i  indicate the (003) reflection. Generally, the  (00 l ) reflections with   $l=2n+1$   give the evidence of the existence of lower symmetry  space group   $P b2_{1}m$  .  The   $\\mathrm{Pb}2_{1}\\mathrm{m}$   polar  phase in the nonpolar matrix accounts for  the FIE behavior with nonzero   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   at room  temperature. Bright-field TEM image of   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$   ceramic, on the contrary,  shows a complex domain pattern, exhibiting  a lamellar-shaped morphology, as shown  in Figure   $4\\mathrm{c}$  . There are two types of mesoscopic domains characterized by interface  boundaries lying in   $(1\\bar{1}0)_{\\mathrm{C}}$   and   $(001)_{\\mathrm{C}}$   planes.  SAED patterns viewed along the   $[001]_{\\mathrm{C}}$   and   $[\\overline{{11}}0]_{\\mathrm{C}}$   zone axes are also given in Figure 4h,i,  which are taken from the domains (labeled  $\\circledast$  and   $\\circledast$  ) in HREM image [Figure 4d], respectively. The (00 l ) reflections with   $l=2n+1$   in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{0.85}T a_{0.15})O_{3}}$   ceramic are much weaker  than those observed in pure   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$  , indicating the decrease of   $\\mathrm{Pb}2_{1}\\mathrm{m}$   polar phase  with Ta addition. This further confirms the  enhanced anti ferro electricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb_{1-x}T a_{x})}$   $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   ceramics.  \n\nBased on the above analyses, it can be confirmed that an enhanced anti ferro electricity  has been achieved in Ta-modified   $\\mathrm{AgNbO}_{3}$    ceramics, which leads to the reduced   $P_{\\mathrm{r}}$   and  increased   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}/E_{\\mathrm{A}}$  , benefiting the recoverable  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/c7b6537c19f9ca763ecf53b4ae260b2b9f73fe2cb85a458217fc68b014039776-1727114957.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   TEM images of pure   $\\mathsf{A g N b O}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{0.85}\\mathsf{T a}_{0.15})\\,\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   ceramics: a) Overview  bright-field image showing three domains in pure  $\\mathsf{A g N b O}_{3}$   ceramics; b) HREM image of  the area labeled (A) in (a); c) Overview bright-field image showing domain walls lying in  the   $(\\bar{\\ }\\bar{\\ }0)_{\\mathsf{C}}$   and   $(001)_{\\mathsf{C}}$   planes in   $\\mathsf{A g}(\\mathsf{N b}_{0.85}\\mathsf{T a}_{0.15})\\,\\mathsf{O}_{3}$   ceramics; d) HREM image of the area  labeled (B) in (c); e–g) SAED patterns taken from the domains labeled   $\\scriptstyle(\\odot-\\odot)$   in (b),  respectively; h,i) SAED patterns taken from the domains labeled   $\\circledast$   and   $\\circledcirc$   in (d), respectively. The interface of domain can be seen from HREM images (b) and (d). The red arrows  in (e), (f), and (i) represent the (003) reflection, indicating that SAED patterns are indexed  to  $P b2_{\\parallel}m$   space group.  \n\nenergy density   $W_{\\mathrm{rec}}$  . Thus, for   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics, in  addition to the increased   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$  , the anti ferroelectric feature is  another reason for the improved energy storage property. This  leads to the question: what is the underlying mechanism for  the enhanced anti ferro electricity in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics?  \n\nGenerally, the phase stability of perovskite structure   $({\\mathrm{ABO}}_{3})$  can be evaluated based on the tolerance factor   $(t)$  , which is  defined as   $t=(R_{\\mathrm{A}}+\\,R_{\\mathrm{O}})/[\\sqrt{2}(R_{\\mathrm{B}}+\\,R_{\\mathrm{O}})],$  , where   $R_{\\mathrm{{A}}},\\;R_{\\mathrm{{B}}}$  , and   $R_{\\mathrm{O}}$  are the ionic radii of A-site cation, B-site cation, and oxygen  anion, respectively. FE phase is stabilized at   $t>1$   and AFE  phase is favored at   $t<1$  .  However, the substitution of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$  for   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$   will not lead to reduced tolerance factor due to the  same radii   $(\\mathrm{Nb}^{5+}$  :   $0.64\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  ,   $\\mathrm{CN}\\,=\\,6$  ;   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$  :   $0.64\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{CN}\\,=\\,6)}$  . In addition to the tolerance factor, the different polar iz ability  between  $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$   may account for the enhanced antiferro electricity in  $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb,Ta)O}_{3}$   ceramics. The polar iz ability of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   $(2.82\\ \\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}^{3})$   is lower than that of   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}~(3.10~\\bar{A}^{3})}$  ),  which makes  B-site cations less sensitive to the applied electric field. The  polar iz ability of   $(\\mathrm{Nb,Ta})\\mathrm{O}_{6}$   in   $\\mathrm{Ag(Nb}_{1-x}\\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\\mathrm{)O}_{3}$   ceramics was  investigated by Raman spectra and shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). The   $\\nu_{1}$   represents a double-degenerate  symmetric O–Nb/Ta–O stretching vibration and   $\\nu_{5}$   represents  a triply degenerate symmetric O–Nb/Ta–O bending vibration.  The  $\\nu_{5}$  , which relates to the   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}/T a^{5+}}$   cation displacement and   $(\\mathrm{Nb,Ta})\\mathrm{O}_{6}$   octahedra tilting,  is found to become weakened in  intensity and broad in shape with increasing Ta addition. The  decrease in intensity is attributed to the lower polar iz ability  of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}~(2.82~\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}^{3})$   compared to that of   $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$     $(3.10\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^{3})$  ,  while  the broadening may relate to the reduction in the correlation  length of displacements. This can be explained by the lower  electronegativity of   $\\mathrm{Ta}^{5+}$   (1\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
