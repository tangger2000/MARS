CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Inorganic Polymers  \n\nInorganic polymers, such as diamond, silica, glass, ceramic and  boron oxide, are polymers composed of nonoxide and oxide  compounds with a skeletal structure, which does not include  carbon atoms in backbone. Usually, inorganic polymers are  stable and tight medium, which can enhance the resistance of  core materials against high temperature scaling and oxidation  effectively. Their much slower structural relaxation time can provide a barrier layer to slow down the diffusion of oxygen or polar  solvents. Here, we put two kinds of compounds as examples to  give some introduction for inorganic polymers for encapsulation.  \n\nCeramics such as silicon oxycarbide (SiCO), silicon carbide  (SiC), silicon nitride   $\\mathrm{(Si_{3}N_{4})}$  , or silicon carbon it ride (SiCN),  obtained by a polymer-derived step method, always show creep  resistance, thermal stability, high temperature strength, corrosion and oxidation stability as well as hardness.  By selecting  appropriate organo elemental compounds precursors such  as poly carbo si lanes (PCS), poly sila zane s (PSA), or poly silo x an es  (PSZ) and controlling the degree of cross linking, pyrolysis  temperature or pyrolysis atmosphere, the micro structure, and  composition and mechanical or chemical properties of ceramics  can be adjusted in a wide range.  These organo elemental compounds exactly show two opportune conditions for encapsulation. On the one hand, they can act as a capping ligand to  passivate the surface of PQDs. On the other hand, they have  remaining silazane moieties forming ceramic protective layers  with different   $\\mathrm{SiN}_{x},$  ,   $\\mathrm{SiN}_{x}\\mathrm{O}_{\\gamma},$   and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{\\gamma}$   ratios, which depends on  the degree of moisture-induced hydrolysis reaction by incomplete cross linking reaction between   $-\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{Si}{-}\\mathrm{N}{-}\\mathrm{H}{-}$   groups  and   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  . Yoon et  al. reported   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PSZ}$   composites  maintain a high PLQYs   $({\\approx}81.7\\%)$   compared with bare   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  QDs   $({\\approx}90.4\\%)$  , and the maximum PL peak   $(522\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) show a  small redshift ( Figure    9 a,b). The   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PSZ}$   composites  can maintain excellent environmental stability while stored at  about 60 day at open air with an improved thermal stability  while heated from 60 to   $140~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (the inset of Figure 9c), they  even exhibited stable PL intensity after more than   $70\\:\\mathrm{{h}}$   in polar  solvents.  Also, it was confirmed that efficiency of   $\\mathrm{PODS@}$  ceramics (poly sila zane, PSZ) were maintained at approximately   $90.2\\%$     $(60\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  ,   $52.1\\%$     $(100\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  , and   $33.7\\%$     $(140~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   compared to  initial efficiency in high-temperature stability test.  \n\nGenerally, glass refer these optical transparent noncrystalline amorphous solid compounds with a disordered atomic  structure, which show a better thermal conductivity character,  mechanical st abilities and more corrosion resistant to chemical  attack than other materials.  Amorphous   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   is the most  common fundamental constituent of glass. And some other  ingredients such as lead, barium, or lanthanum oxide can be  added to change the properties of glass. The more general  types of silicate glasses are fused quartz, soda-lime-silica glass,  sodium borosilicate glass, lead-oxide glass, a lumi no silicate  glass, boro-germanate glasses, and so on. Usually, there is a  need a kinetic ally frozen by rapid quenching process to form  glass. With a further cutting and polishing, the characteristics  of glass, such as transmission, reflection, and refraction parameters, are enhanced a lot.  Liu et  al. observed that   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/b12b8c9d9563f45b8dd30370e508a7ee83c1258aea8707fe82f5cd87e58cd798-1723834117.jpg)  \nFigure 9.   a,b) Normalized PL (solid line) and absorbance (dashed line) spectra of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}@\\mathsf{P S Z}$  composites at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}.$   c) Stability  test outcomes of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}@\\mathsf{P S Z}$   composites under\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
