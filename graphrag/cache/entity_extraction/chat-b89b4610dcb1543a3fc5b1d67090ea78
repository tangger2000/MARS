CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

Our previous study proved that by substituting the hydrogen (H) of the  benzene ring with fluorine (F), the free energy of the perovskite  surface was significantly reduced, endowing the perovskite with  superior stability against moisture in ambient air.  The perovskite layer   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.05}\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.10}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{0.97}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.03})_{3}$   with   $5\\%$   excess of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   was fabricated using anti solvent method  and annealed  at   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $20~\\mathrm{min}$   before applying the modulators. The passivation agent, PEAI and tBBAI were applied by spin coating on  the perovskite surface with   $15\\times10^{-3}$    m  solution in iso prop an ol  without further annealing ( Figure   1 B). The surface morphology  of the PEAI and tBBAI-passivated perovskite films is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the results are  shown in Figure 1C–E. For the untreated neat perovskite film, it is  observed that the domain size of the perovskite crystals is around   $500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  . After pas siva ting with PEAI and tBBAI, their appearance  remains unchanged, implying that the surface pass iv ation does  not alter the morphology of the perovskite active layer.  \n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to characterize the surface elemental properties of the passivated  perovskite, and the results are summarized in  Figure    2 A–C.  The C 1s spectra of all perovskite film surfaces are compared  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/042c858fc8d4a1d891958dc77f80dacecd6674288d2d4daf94f413a7df7b79cc-1723835226.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   A) Chemical structures of PEAI and tBBAI.

D) XRD patterns of neat perovskite, perovskite/PEAI, and perovskite/tBBAI  films.  \n\nin Figure  2B. In the neat perovskite film, a   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   peak at   ${\\approx}288\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   is observed, which is related to the oxygen and water  exposure of the surface of the perovskite film.  This peak is  significantly suppressed in the XPS spectra of the passivated  perovskite film, proving that surface pass iv ation with PEAI and  tBBAI can effectively protect the perovskite from oxygen and  moisture in ambient air.  A further XPS depth profiling for  tBBAI-passivated perovskite was carried out to reveal the out-ofplane direction elemental distribution as shown in Figure 2C.  Compared to the spectra of the neat perovskite film (Figure S1,  Supporting Information), the I 3d signal gradient of perovskite/ tBBAI starts at deeper part in the film, suggesting the tBBAI  layer thickness of  ${<}5~\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nThe structure of the un pas siva ted and passivated perovskite  film is characterized by XRD. As shown in Figure S2 in the  Supporting Information. The detailed XRD for   $2\\theta\\:<\\:20^{\\circ}$   is  shown in Figure 2D. Similar to a previous report,  nonpassivated perovskite film shows excessive amount of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   at  ${\\approx}12.8^{\\circ}$  For the PEAI-passivated perovskite film, diffraction peaks corresponding to PEAI at   $2\\theta=4.3^{\\circ}$  ,   $8.6^{\\circ}$  , and   $12.9^{\\circ}$   are observed,  implying crystalline PEAI on the surface of the perovskite film.  The XRD spectrum of the tBBAI-passivated perovskite film  exhibits no extra diffraction peaks, which suggests an amorphous morphology of the pass iv ation layer. We attribute this  result to an increased steric hindrance due to the  tert -butyl substitution of tBBAI as compared to PEAI.  \n\nWe investigated the op to electronic quality of the perovskite film by TRPL and steady-state absolute intensity  photo luminescence (AIPL). TRPL measurements on samples  with the structure glass/FTO/mp $\\cdot\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3,}$  /perovskite/interface  layer/ without and with HTL (spiro-OMeTAD) are shown  in  Figure    3 . For the samples without HTL (Figure  3A), at   $t>200$    ns after the excitation pulse the TRPL curves can be  well fitted with a (mono-) exponential function with the decay  times shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. We  observe a significant difference between the surface treatment  with the two modulators: The decay time for the PEAI-treated  perovskite film is a factor of three and for tBBAI a factor of five  higher than for the non pas siva ted film. We apply numerical  simulations to model the TRPL measurements at times beyond  200  ns. The details of these simulations are described in the  Supporting Information (Note S1). Since the only difference  between the samples is the surface layers, we fitted the numerical model to the data with only one free parameter, the surface recombination velocity  S . For the sample with the longest  decay time (tBBAI, black dots in Figure 3A), the decay could be  caused not only by  S  but also by non radiative bulk recombinations (with mono molecular recombination rate constant  $k_{1}$  , see  Note in the Supporting Information) or radiative bimolecular  recombination s (with bimolecular recombination rate constant   $k_{2})$  . Therefore, three extreme cases are considered, where the  PL decay at later times for tBBAI is caused exclusively by nonradiative (bulk) recombination s   $(k_{1}=k_{1}^{\\mathrm{max}}\\mathrm{~,~}k_{2}=0,S=0)$  ), by bimolecular radiative (bulk) recombination s   $(k_{2}=k_{2}^{\\mathrm{max}}\\,,k_{1}=0,S=0)$  ),  and by surface recombination s   $(k_{1}\\,=\\,k_{2}\\,=\\,0)$  ). The  S -fits for  all these cases are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/37f5beb4853bea6771d9e39b9e4d3d9a5037e05aa5dfcba0b18f140629482a59-1723835229.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   A) TRPL for the layer structure glass/FTO/mp  $\\mathsf{A l}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}/$  /perovskite/without surface layer (control, blue), with PEAI (red), and tBBAI (black).
