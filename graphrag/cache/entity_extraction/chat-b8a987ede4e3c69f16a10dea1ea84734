Contrary to  the first two methods, another way to improve the stability of  PQDs is the encapsulation, which mainly refers the coating or  separating strategies by the introduction of mechanically robust  and airtight inorganic matrix or flexible stable organic com- pounds as protective layers on PQDs. Now, encapsulation is the  most efficient way to improve the stability of PQDs absolutely.  Effective encapsulations can confine the PQDs from each other  by the isolation effects produced by extra matrix, increasing  their tolerance to humidity and/or oxygen. Specially, the encapsulation strategy can ensure the stabilization of PQDs against  aggregation in solution efficaciously and avoid the anion  exchange when the PQDs were mixed in different halides composition. It can also decrease the degradation caused by the  ionic characters of perovskite crystal structure even exposed  into polar solvent, atmosphere, high-energy electron beams,  and high temperature. Consequently, the encapsulation is an  effective and straightforward strategy to improve stability of  PQDs meanwhile maintaining the outstanding luminescence.  \n\nRecently, many effective encapsulation strategies have been  proposed including various methods or different materials,  etc., and it is urgent to give a broad assessment and critical discussions for the current investigation status in this area. Herein, we set forth to make a detailed review of current developments about these strategies on the following topics: i) the  effects of encapsulation; ii) the common methods for encaps­ ulation; iii) applicable surface encapsulation materials; and  iv) op to electronic applications in white LEDs, laser, and biology.  Finally, we discuss the confronting problems and potential  challenges of encapsulation strategies to highlight basic principles and possible directions in developing highly stable PQDs.  \n\n# 2. Encapsulation Principles  \n\nThe instability of PQDs directly displays as the degradation  of luminescence, which are mainly caused by the effect of  the oxygen or moisture, light, and heat, corresponding to  the chemical, photo, and thermal condition, respectively. In  fact, most deterioration of PQDs is a synergistic result from  chemical, photo, and thermal factors in practical circumstance.  For example, the decomposition and crystal regrowth were  accelerated under oxygen or moisture atmosphere at a higher  temperature or strong illumination; the oxygen-induced  decomposition can only happen upon illumination. Hence, the  applausive encapsulation should improve the chemical, photo,  and thermal st abilities simultaneously.  \n\n# 2.1. Improve the Chemical Stability  \n\nThe chemical stability, i.e., the tolerance to anion exchange,  moisture, and polar solvent, is an important property of PQDs  for further applications.  By generating dense layers on the  surface of PQDs, the encapsulation can efficiently improve  the performance of PQDs including the chemical stability and  the desired emission bands together with maintaining the  high photo luminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) ( Figure   1 a).  Therefore, the optical property, colloidal stability, and even  structural integrity of the PQDs can keep good when even  exposed to polar solvent or atmosphere. The improvements of  performance can be understood as the following reasons.  \n\ni)\t \u0007 Usually, the PQDs with different halides composition cannot  be mixed to give their separated emission in solution or solid  for the inevitable anion exchange. The inside reason is that the  large intrinsic vacancies and surface defects assist the halides  diffusion or exchange easily for changing the original composition. Encapsulation via forming dense layers of surface isolates  PQD in limited space and inhibits the process effectively.   As a result, PQDs composed by different halide by encapsulation can keep their separated narrow emissions and original  compositions even when put together.  \n\nii)\t \u0007 These surface ligands such as oleic acid (OA) or oleylamine  (OLA) are usually not tightly bound to surface of PQDs in  colloidal state. Accordingly, the large surface energy of PQDs  caused by the small size effect or the influence from protondonating solvents always remove the ligands easily and render  the PQDs to aggregate seriously. The proper moisture exposure can induce the solvation of excess  $\\mathrm{Pb}$   on the surface and  the recrystallization of PQDs to produce large crystal grains,  rendering an incense ment of PLQYs.  However, exposure  directly into a lot of water may lead to the decomposition of  perovskite crystals.  Only mildly polar solvents, isopropyl  alcohol, 1-butanol, acetone, and acetonitrile enabled complete precipitation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   PQDs with highly stable and  bright luminescence from raw solution. Fortunately, the encap sul ation layers decrease the existed strong van der Waals  attraction forces and increase the energy barrier for adjacent  PQDs, avoiding a spontaneous growth in solution or solid.  Specially, the function aliz ation of water-resisting layers on  the surface of PQDs can improve their humidity tolerance  and passivate surface defects. Also, efficient encapsulation  materials can avoid the dynamic d is solubility equilibrium  between the halides, lead species, or capped ligands in PQDs  and the solution, maintaining a stable colloidal state.  \n\niii)\t\u0007 The intrinsic ionic crystal features can make PQDs decompose into monohydrate and dihydrate compounds seriously  in water (under   $\\Nu_{2}$   atmosphere) after about   $4\\,\\mathrm{{h}}$   of storage.   Specially, the moisture can induce re solvation, re crystal lization, or decomposition of perovskite crystal, resulting in the  degradation of luminescence and a severe efficiency decline  in devices. The function aliz ation of gas and moisture impermeable layers can avoid the direct contact between PQDs  and moisture or oxygen and decrease the influence from the  intrinsic ionic crystal features of halide perovskite crystal. A  full retention of optical properties was kept for several weeks  even directly immersing in water or exposing at atmosphere.  Thereafter, the encapsulation reduces the etching effect  when exposed to polar solvents or decreases damages from  penetrated oxygen effectively.  \n\n# 2.2.
