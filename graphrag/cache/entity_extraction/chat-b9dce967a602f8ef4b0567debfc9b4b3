CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The formation of   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$  , similar to the   $[\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}]^{2-}$  , combined with the  \n\ndefect tolerance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  , also explaining the crystal structure stability upon a few percentages of Bi alloying.  \n\nHere, we like to discuss more details in the electronic  structure of pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   and Bi-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   with   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   defect complex in Figure 5c,d. For pure   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  ,  the VBM is derived from   $\\mathrm{Cl}\\ 3\\mathrm{p}$   states, while the CBM consists of the antibonding states of   $\\mathrm{sn\\5s}$   and Cl 3p orbitals. For  Bi-doped  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   with the   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   model, a fully occupied  defect band consisting of Cl 3p and Bi 6s orbitals is formed at   $0.99~\\mathrm{eV}$   above the VBM, which is responsible for the experimentally observed additional absorption peaks   $(\\approx\\!400\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   for  the Bi-doped  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   samples as discussed above. Figure 5e  depicts a schematic energy diagram for Bi-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  .  It is known that Bi 6s orbitals are much deeper than   $\\mathrm{Sn\\5s}$    orbitals.  Therefore, while  $\\mathrm{Sn}$   can easily lose its 5 s  electrons  and exhibit the nominal  $+4$   oxidation state, Bi can hardly lose  its 6s electrons to be oxidized to the oxidation state of   $+5$   (in  fact, no  $\\mathrm{Bi^{5+}}$  -based chlorides such as  $\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}$   have been reported  in literatures). The pseudo closed   $\\operatorname{Bi}^{3+}\\,6s^{2}$   orbitals hybridize  with   $\\mathrm{Cl}\\ 3\\mathrm{p}$   orbitals, forming antibonding states (denoted as   $\\mathrm{VBM^{\\prime}}$   as used above) above the nonbonding Cl   $3\\mathrm{p}$   orbitalsderived VBM and thus a reduced bandgap (denoted as   ${E_{\\mathrm{g}}}^{\\prime}$  ).  On the other hand, as the unoccupied Bi 6p orbitals are  higher than the   $\\mathrm{Sn\\5s}$   orbitals, the   $\\mathrm{sn\\5s}$  -derived CBM is  almost not affected by the Bi doping. In short, the incorporated Bi in the   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   state leads to an up-shifted VBM but  an unchanged CBM. Since our material showed a blue emission with PLQY of   $78.9\\%$  , we hypothesize such high PLQY is  caused by the excitons trapped by the   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$   pyramid which  are strongly confined in the 0D  $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   per ovsk ites, similar  to high PLQY observed in the low-dimensional halide perov­ skites reported by Ma and co-workers.  In our case, the  luminescent   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$   pyramids are well surrounded by the  wide bandgapped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   matrix, which serves to localize  the excitons and enhance radiative recombination, in analogy  to type I core–shell structure for traditional III–V and II–VI  semiconductor nano crystals. At higher Bi concentrations,  however, the well isolation of   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$   pyramids are no  longer preserved and formation of neighboring   $[\\mathrm{BiCl}_{5}]^{2-}$   clusters would appear, which not only result in reduced exciton  localization, but also cause severe self-absorption, leading to  PLQY degradation. Thereby, the trade-off between the isolation effect and the amount of the luminescent centers leads  to the PLQY maximum of  $78.9\\%$   at   $x=2.75\\%$  .  \n\nOur   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6};x\\mathrm{Bi}$   samples possess high PLQYs and excellent stability, promising potential application for lighting and  back light display. Here, we constructed white LED by mixing   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}{:}2.75\\%\\mathrm{Bi}$   with yellow phosphors   $(\\mathrm{Ba}_{2}\\mathrm{Sr}_{2}\\mathrm{SiO}_{4};\\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$  and   $\\mathrm{GaAlSiN}_{3}{:E u}^{2+}$  )  to  demonstrate  their  application.   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{snCl}_{6}{:2.75\\%}$   Bi with blue emission and yellow phosphor  are mixed with curable resin, coated on a commercially available   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   LED chip, and cured. The corresponding electro luminescent spectrum is shown in  Figure   6 a. The CIE  xy coordinates of the white-LED output are (0.36, 0.37) related to  a warm white with a correlated color temperature of 4486 K  (Figure 6b). As shown in the inset image, the working device  based on the mixed phosphors emitted bright white light,  which demonstrates that the   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  :Bi per ovsk ites are promising for lighting applications.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/346c302044f95bfa3ee7175d68dc92c35d6b4feb9bb44cafbe138a4d59625745-1723824436.jpg)  \nFigure 6.  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n C l}_{6}{:}2.75\\%$  Bi-based lightemit diodes (LEDs) with warm white emission. b) CIE color coordinates  corresponding to white-LED device and (inset) photo of operating LED.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn conclusion, we have reported bismuth doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   perov­ skite variant with a blue emission at  $455\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and an outstanding  PLQY up to  $78.9\\%$  , the highest value reported for lead-free perovskites emitting blue light. Careful material characterization  and first-principle calculations revealed that  $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   is incorporated  into   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$   matrix at the Sn site, and would preferably form   $\\mathrm{Bi_{Si_{Si}+V_{C l}}}$   defect complex which is responsible for the strong  blue emission. Thanks to the large decomposition enthalpy  of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{SnCl}_{6}$  , our blue emitting phosphors demonstrated  excellent thermal and water stability. Finally, by integrating this  phosphor with commercial yellow phosphors and 365 nm LED  chip, we demonstrated a warm white LED. We believe our findings will open up new avenues for exploration of novel lead-free  perovskite emitters.  \n\n# 4.
