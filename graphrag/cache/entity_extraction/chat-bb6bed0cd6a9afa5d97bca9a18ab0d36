CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of  the champion devices with and without DFPDA additive are  depicted in Figure 6d. The integrated  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   values of the devices  with and without DFPDA additive are 24.99 and  $24.47\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  respectively, which match well the values obtained from the   $J{-}V$   curves in Figure  6c   $\\scriptscriptstyle(<\\!1\\%$   discrepancy). Figure  6e shows  the steady-state current density and PCE measured at the  maximum power point of the hybrid PSCs.

The improved   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   can not only suppress the backwards movement of holes from the Spiro-OMeTAD to the perovskite layer  but also assist in the charge separation, charge transport, and  collection of the photo-generated carriers. Therefore, the introduction of DFPDA additive directly contributes to the enhanced  \n\nTable   1.   Summary of the photovoltaic parameters of the hybrid PSCs  with different concentrations of DFPDA additive. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/18d4fd9804fb3bcf9f3cf71a371fbb01f9a7bfb81af2c784075bdd7d6b9217dc-1723830423.jpg)  \n\noutput voltage and current of the hybrid PSCs. The dependency  of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   on light intensity is usually used to assess the recombination mechanism in hybrid PSCs. According to the literature,  when the diode ideality factor is close to 1, the effect  of Shockley-Read-Hall recombination is not apparent. From the  slope of the curves in Figure 6g, the ideality factor decreased  from 1.98 to 1.29 with treatment with DFPDA, which suggests  that the trap-assisted charge recombination was effectively suppressed, and this is consistent with the results of the TRPL and  SCLC measurements.  \n\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the charge transfer and  recombination process in the hybrid PSCs. Nyquist plots of  devices with and without DFPDA additive are shown Figure 6h,  and Figure S13, Supporting Information, displays the relevant  equivalent circuit model for EIS fitting. The equivalent circuit  consists of the series resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{s}})$  , the transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{tr}})$  , and the recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$  .  Table S7, Supporting Information, lists the fitting results. The hybrid PSC  with   $0.4\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\%$   DFPDA additive exhibits a higher   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   than  the control device, which reflects a lower recombination rate  in the PSCs with DFPDA additive.

As shown  in Figure 6i and Table S8, Supporting Information, compared  to the control device, the device with DFPDA additive demonstrates a prominently slower   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   decay. The   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   decay time of  the device with DFPDA additive   $(241.98~\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$   is   ${\\approx}4$   times that  of the control device   $(61.94~\\upmu\\mathrm{s})$  , which is consistent with the  reduced charge recombination in the DFPDA-treated perovskite  film, as concluded from the TRPL and EIS measurements.  \n\nBesides the high efficiency, long-term stability is another  critical characteristic for the application of the hybrid PSCs. To study the stability of the hybrid PSCs with and without  DFPDA additive, the as-prepared PSCs without encapsulation were stored in air under relative humidity of   ${\\approx}25\\%$   and  temperature of   $25\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . After 60 days of storage, the hybrid  PSCs with DFPDA additive maintained   ${\\tt>}92\\%$   of their initial  efficiencies, while the control devices only retained  $66\\%$   of their  initial efficiencies during the same period ( Figure   7 a). The control device was slightly discolored after aging for 60 days, which  results from a fractional decomposition to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and phase  change of perovskite from   $\\alpha$   phase to   $\\delta$   phase, as confirmed  from XRD measurements (Figure  7b). The improved crystallinity, passivated defects, and increased hydrophobic it y of the  DFPDA-treated perovskite are likely to be responsible for the  improved air stability.  \n\nFurthermore, the thermal and light st abilities of the hybrid  PSCs with and without DFPDA additive were also evaluated.\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
