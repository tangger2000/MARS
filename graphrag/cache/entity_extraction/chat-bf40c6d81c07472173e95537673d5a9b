CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

After heat treatment (Figure 3a), the peak at   $19.97^{\\circ}$   moves to a  larger angle of about   $20.24^{\\circ}$  ,  indicating the semi-crystalline   $\\beta$  -phase of PVDF domains after thermal annealing treatment.  \n\nThe full X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of  the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers is shown in  Figure 3c. XPS analysis of the high-resolution spectra involving  Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and  $\\operatorname{Br}\\,3\\mathrm{d}$   is then conducted to further clarify the  existences of NCs and their electronic states. Figure 3d shows  the typical Cs 3d spectrum, in which the strong peaks at 723.85  and  .86  eV are corresponding to Cs   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and Cs   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$  ,  respectively, suggesting that there is no CsBr primal reactant  but added to the perovskite structure as a monovalent ion in the  as-prepared   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers.  The two Br  3d signals, corresponding to   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   and   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   peaks, are clearly  seen in the   $\\operatorname{Br}\\,3\\mathrm{d}$   spectrum (Figure 3e). As for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$  fiber, the Br   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   and   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   peaks in   $\\operatorname{Br}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}$   spectrum have  shifted to higher binding energy, indicating the modified chemical environment of   $\\mathrm{[PbBr]^{-}}$   anion and the stronger   $\\operatorname{Pb-Br}$   interactions after addition of PVDF. As shown in Figure 3f, the Pb  4f spectrum for the primitive NCs has been recorded with two  contributions   $4\\mathrm{f}_{5/2}$   and   $4\\mathrm{f}_{7/2}$   locating at 142.96 and   $138.10\\ \\mathrm{eV},$    respectively, which correspond to   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   cations.

Under the condition of frequency of   $1~\\mathrm{Hz}$   and effective size  of   $0.80~\\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$  , the piezoelectric output of composite fibers  based PENG with the periodic horizontal compression and  release processes are measured by force simulator. As shown  in  Figure   4 , in order to confirm that the power output originates from   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers rather than  other factors including the test system, the devices without  fibers (blank) and with pure PVDF fibers are tested under the  same conditions for comparison. It can be clearly seen that  the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device without fiber originate from noise and can be negligible compared to that of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers based PENG (Figure 4a,b).  Furthermore, the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device with  pure PVDF fibers (6  V,   $10\\,\\,\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{A\\,\\,cm}^{-2})$  ) are relatively smaller  than that of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers based PENG  (103  V,   $170~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ), implied the key role of piezoelectric  effect of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  . Switching-polarity tests are also carried  out to verify the generated output signals originated from  the piezoelectric phenomenon. A negative output signal is  observed when the PENG is connected in forward connection (Figure 4c). While under a reverse connection, an oppo- site output signal is measured as shown in Figure  4d. It is  obvious that the electric signals are reversible, indicating that  the detected outputs are produced from the PENG strained  by compressing motion.  And a difference of voltage peak  values between compressing and releasing conditions is also  observed, which can be explained by the difference of the  strain rate in the process of applying and removing the stress  on the piezoelectric nano generator.  \n\nIn order to fabricate high performance   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$  composite fibers based PENG, the effects of some key para­ meters, such as mass ratio of PVDF to  ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  , electro spinning  time, polarization voltages, as well as fabrication method, are  also investigated. As shown in  Figure   5 a, the electro spinning  time and polarization voltage are set to 1 min and   $5\\;\\mathrm{kV}.$  . When  the mass ratio of PVDF to   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   are kept at 8, 6, 3, 2, 1.50,  1, and 0.80, the density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the device is 25, 36, 87, 170, 21,  20, and   $15~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
