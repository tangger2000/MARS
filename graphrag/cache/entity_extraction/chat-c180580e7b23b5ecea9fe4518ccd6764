CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is worth noting  that the PLQY of NIR emission of this   $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   reaches the unprecedented  $50\\%$  , which is by far the  highest value among  $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   doped lead-free per ovsk ites ( Table   1 ).  \n\n# 2.3. Stability  \n\nStability is always an essential element for practical application  of a material. Thermo grav i metric analysis (TGA) of undoped  and doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   shows no significant weight loss until   $510~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (Figure S13, Supporting Information), indicating high  thermal stability. Provably, the PL intensity can nearly maintain  after heating at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for  $\\approx1000{\\mathrm{~h~}}$  . (Figure S15a, Supporting  Information). Meantime, the   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   doped and   $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   codoped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   exhibit excellent ambient stability. The XRD  measurements (Figure S14a,c, Supporting Information) show  that the   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$   doped and   $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   structure can remain stable for more than 4 months and 90 days  with the visible and NIR emission intensity still holding the  nearly same intensity as the original value respectively under  ambient conditions (Figure S14b,d, Supporting Information).  Subsequently, to evaluate the photo stability, a portable UV lamp  (8 W, a distance of one centimeter) was used to continuously  irradiate  $\\mathrm{{Sub}^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   and   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   samples. As can be seen in Figure S15b (Supporting Information), the PL intensity of   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$  co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   is almost quenched within   $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$  , while  $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   codoped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   maintains   $45\\%$   of the original PL intensity  after being irradiated for   $100\\mathrm{~h~}$  , demonstrating much superior  photo stability of   $\\mathrm{{Sub}^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   than   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$  co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g l n C l_{6}}$  .  By observing the color of the samples,  we find that with the extension of irradiation time, more and  more black spots appear in the   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  ,  and eventually cover the entire sample. Comparatively, the  color of   $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$   maintains unchanged \n\n (Figure S16, Supporting Information).

This  confirms that the black spots in   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}{-}Y b^{3+}}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}}$  after UV light radiating may come from the UV light-induced  \n\nTable   1.   Summary of PL Characteristics of Different   ${\\sf Y b}^{3+}$   Doped Lead-Free Per ovsk ites. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/90b6916137585b22a6e97c5a5ec113d322eea5a0a9c1eb1bf6d38be94807f65e-1727105110.jpg)  \na) Nano crystals, thin film, and single crystals are mentioned as NCs, film, and SCs respectively.
