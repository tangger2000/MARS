Finally,   $80~\\mathsf{n m}$   of Au top electrode was thermally  evaporated under vacuum with a shadow mask. The area of the cells was   $0.12\\ {\\sf c m}^{2}$  ; when measuring, a   $0.0887~\\mathsf{c m}^{2}$   mask was used to define the  accurate aperture area for the cells.  \n\nDevice Characterizations : SEM (FEI NanoSEM650) was used to  characterize the morphology of the   $|\\mathsf{n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  , and perovskite films  and also the cross-sectional image of the fully device. The XRD patterns  of the perovskite films were performed by Mini Flex 600 (Rigaku  D/MAX-2500, Japan). The EQE spectra were conducted in air without  encapsulate by the Enli Tec (Taiwan) measurement system. The current– voltage characteristics of the devices were measured by a Keithley 2400  Source meter under AM 1.5G illumination with a xenon-lamp-based solar  simulator (Enli. Tec., Taiwan). The intensity of the light was calibrated  with a KG-5 filter Si photodiode. And the cells were measured with a  metal mask   $(0.0887\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{2})$   to reduce the influence of the scattered light.  The measuring condition was forward scan   $(0{-}1.2\\,\\lor,$   scan rate  $20\\:\\mathsf{m V\\:S^{-1}}$  ,  delay time   $20\\ \\mathsf{m s}.$  ) and reverse scan   $\\scriptstyle{(1.2-0\\ \\vee,}$   scan rate   $20\\,\\mathrm{\\mV\\,\\sf{s}^{-1}}$  ,  delay time   $20\\;\\mathrm{\\mums},$  ). The best PSCs were sent to an PV calibration  laboratory (Quality supervision and Testing Center of Chemical and  Physical Power Sources of Information Industry, China) for certification.  The AFM images were characterized by atomic force microscopy  (NanoNavi-SPA400, Japan). The PL and TRPL spectra were carried  out via a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS980, Edinburgh  Instruments, UK).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the supports from National  Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No.  2018 Y FB 1500103), the National Natural Science Foundation of China  (Grant No. 61674084), the Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for  Discipline Innovation of Higher Education of China (Grant No. B16027),  Tianjin Science and Technology Project (Grant No. 18 ZX J MT G 00220),  and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,  Nankai University (Grant Nos. 63191736 and ZB19500204).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ncarrier transfer, electron-transport layer, energy alignment engineering,  perovskite solar cells  \n\nReceived: September 4, 2019 Revised: December 4, 2019 Published online:  \n\n[3]\t a) Q.  Jiang, Y.  Zhao, X.  Zhang, X.  Yang, Y.  Chen, Z.  Chu, Q.  Ye,  X.  Li, Z.  Yin, J.  You,  Nat.
