CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

MXenes with the general chemical formula of   $\\mathrm{M_{n+1}X_{n}T_{x}}$     $(n\\,=\\,1{-}4)$   can be prepared by selectively etching the A-site  atomic layers of the precursor MAX phase   $(\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{n+1}}\\mathrm{AX}_{\\mathrm{n}})$  , where  M represents the early transition metal, A usually represents  IIIA and IVA element, X represents carbon and/or nitrogen,  and   $\\mathrm{T_{x}}$   represents surface functional groups. Recently,   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}},$  ,  as the most widely used MXene, possesses facile preparation,  high electrical conductivity, flexibility, and solution processability, and also shows wide application potential in different  functional layers for high-performance PVSCs.  Pristine   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   with high electrical conductivity was generally applied  to enhance the electron mobility and charge transfer ability of  ETL. Notably, surface function aliz ation of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   with abundant surface groups (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{=O}$  ,   $-\\mathrm{OH}$  ,   $-\\mathrm{F},$  ) can further regulate the work function (WF) and especially achieve synergistic  effects of functional molecules (groups). Wang et  al. first  introduced   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   MXene with UV-ozone treatment as ETL  in PVSCs.  Simple UV-ozone treatment effectively increased  the surface   $\\mathrm{Ti}{-}\\mathrm{O}$   bonds and regulated the WF of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}},$   and  sequent champion PVSCs achieved much higher PCE of   $17.17\\%$  than that   $(5\\%)$   of the control device with pristine  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   ETL.  Zhao et al. employed functional i zed MXenes modified by dodecy lt rime th oxys i lane   $(\\mathrm{H})$   and flu oro alkyl si lane (F) molecules to  optimize the energy level and improve charge transfer of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$    ETL.  As a result, the targeted PVSCs achieved a significantly  improved PCE from   $22.36\\%$   to   $24.12\\%$  . Therefore, the functionalized   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   shows great potential in further enhancing  device performance, while applications and in-depth investigations of functional i zed   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   as CBL of inverted PVSCs are  still lacking.  \n\nIn this work, we introduce tetra but yl ammonium bromide (TBAB) functional i zed   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   (TBAB $\\mathrm{\\cdotTi_{3}C_{2}T_{x}}$   as CBL  to improve the PCBM/Ag cathode inter facial quality for the  first time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further suggests that the partial charge of TBAB is transferred  from N atom to Br atom and then to the surface of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    and meanwhile the charge transfer brings about molecular  dipole moment in the  $_\\mathrm{z}$  -axis direction, which together leads to  the significant WF decrease of TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  . Consequently,  the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL exhibits high electrical conductivity  and significantly reduced WF of   $3.9\\,\\mathrm{\\eV},$   which is conducive  to optimizing energy level alignment and enhancing charge  extraction. Moreover, the TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL can effectively  inhibit the iodine ions migration from perovskite layer to   $\\mathrm{Ag}$    cathode, which synergistic ally facilitates more efficient charge  transport and less charge recombination, thus enabling significantly higher PCE of   $21.65\\%$   for the TBAB $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based  device. Moreover, the optimal PCE of the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based  device also obviously outperforms that of the BCP based device   $(19.94\\%)$   in this work and other previously reported devices  based on   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbI}_{3}/\\mathrm{PCBM}$   with different CBLs. In addition, the  TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based devices also achieve improved air stability  and thermal stability, which should be attributed to the effective  inhibition of the iodine ions migration from perovskite layer to  Ag cathode by the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL.  \n\n# 2. Results and Discussion  \n\nTetra but yl ammonium bromide (TBAB) ( Figure    1 a), a typical  and low-cost quaternary ammonium salt, can be used for   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   MXene inter cal ation by the electrostatic interaction  between negative-charged surface of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  and   $\\mathrm{TBA^{+}}$   and  possible replacement of the protons of hydroxyl groups located  on  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   surface with   $\\mathrm{TBA^{+}}$  .  As shown in Figure 1b, TBAB  functional i zed   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$     $(\\mathrm{TBAB-Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}})$   is prepared by first  etching   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{AlC}_{2}$   with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and then intercalating multilayer   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   with TBAB. In addition, pristine   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$     $(\\mathrm{p\\!\\!-\\!\\!Ti_{3}C_{2}T_{x}})$   is also prepared by minimally intensive  layer de lamination method, which is widely used to prepare 2D  MXenes.  Figure 1c displays X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns  of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{AlC}_{2}$  ,  $\\mathrm{p{\\cdot}T i_{3}C_{2}T_{x,}}$   and TBAB-  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  . The (104) characteristic  peak   $(2\\theta=39^{\\circ})$  ) of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{AlC}_{2}$   is disappeared and the (002) peak is  obviously shifted to smaller angle, suggesting successful transformation of   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{AlC}_{2}$   to   $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  .
