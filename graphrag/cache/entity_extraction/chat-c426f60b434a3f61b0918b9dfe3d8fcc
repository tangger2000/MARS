CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The  dark   $J{-}V$   curves for the control and PBGH-modified devices  are shown in Figure  4e, demonstrating decreased leakage  current after PBGH incorporation. The smaller leakage current is originated from the lower trap density and less carrier  recombination at the buried interface, resulting in increased   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and FF.  Furthermore, according to Mott–Schottky equation   $C^{-2}\\,=\\,2(V_{\\mathrm{bi}}{-}V)/(A^{2}\\mathrm{e}\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathrm{N_{A}})$  , the capacitance-voltage   $\\left(C\\mathrm{-}V\\right)$  curves under dark conditions were measured to investigate the  influence of PBGH for the built-in potential   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{bi}}\\right)$  . As plotted in  Figure 4f, the extracted   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   values for the control and PBGHmodified devices are 1.01 and   $1.13~\\mathrm{V},$  , respectively. The enlarged   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   contributes to the higher   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}},$   following the same trend of   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   values shown in the  $J{-}V$   curves.  \n\nThen the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   dependence on light intensity was measured  to reveal the charge recombination mechanism. The ideality  factors ( n ) calculated from the slopes in Figure  $4\\mathrm{g}$   are 1.92 and  1.47   $\\mathrm{K_{B}T\\ \\mathrm{q}^{-1}}$   for the control and PBGH-modified PSCs, respectively. The ideality factor for the PBGH-modified PSC is much  closer to 1 than that of the control device, illustrating the reduction of trap-assisted recombination in the optimized device. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements  were further carried out, and the devices were tested at a potential bias of   $1.00\\ \\mathrm{V}.$   The Nyquist plots are fitted by the equivalent circuit model (Figure 4h), and relevant calculation parameters are summarized in Table S8 (Supporting Information).  The recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$   value is increased from   $506.30~\\Omega$   for the control PSC to   $809.60~\\Omega$   for the PBGH-modified device, confirming a lower carrier recombination rate in  the optimized PSC.  Moreover, the charge-transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{tr}})$   of the control and optimized devices is 42.11 and   $30.92~\\Omega$  ,  respectively, indicating a better carrier transport.  Consequently, PBGH modification accounts to restrained carrier  recombination and profited charge transport, thus providing  enhanced FF of the PSCs.  \n\nIn order to analyze the trap densities in the PSCs quantitatively, SCLC measurements were performed on the electrononly devices with a structure of   $\\mathrm{FTO/SDO_{2}(P B G H)}$  /perovskite/ PCBM/Ag. As depicted in Figure  4i, based on the trap-filled  limit region, the electron trap density   $(n_{\\mathrm{trap}})$   can be calculated  via the equation   $n_{\\mathrm{trap}}=(2\\varepsilon_{r}\\varepsilon_{0}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}})/(\\mathrm{e}L^{2})$  ,  and the related calculation parameters are listed in Table S9 (Supporting Information). Obviously, the trap-filled limit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$   for the  control device is   $0.32~\\mathrm{V}$   and is decreased to   $0.12~\\mathrm{V}$   after PBGH  modification. The   $n_{\\mathrm{trap}}$   values for the control and PBGH-modified devices are   $6.47\\stackrel{*}{\\times}10^{15}$   and   $2.43\\times10^{15}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  , respectively,  demonstrating fewer defects as well as undoubtedly suppressed  trap-assisted recombination in the PBGH-modified PSCs.  \n\nIn addition to device efficiencies, long-term st abilities for  the perovskite films and PSCs were tested under different  aging conditions.  Figure    5 a displays the XRD patterns of the  control and PBGH/perovskite films before and after aging at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   with   $85\\%$   relative humidity (RH). After aging for   $500\\textrm{h}$  ,  the control sample exhibits strong extra diffraction peaks of \n\n  $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$   phase, whereas none of these peaks appear for the \n\n  $\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{B}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{H}/$  perovskite film.  This means that PBGH modification  strategy can suppress the phase transition caused by exposure  to humid environment, which originates from the passivated  shallow level defects in the optimized perovskite film.  And  this phenomenon is further confirmed by the corresponding  photographs of the perovskite films shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). It is noted that the color of the control  perovskite film tends to change gradually from black to yellow,  while the PBGH/perovskite film shows no obvious change in  color. The improved moisture stability of the PBGH/perovskite film is mainly attributed to the enlarged grains and  the  enhanced hydrophobic it y of the perovskite film (Figure  1d,f).  The reduced and merged grain boundaries (GBs) help with  preventing the moisture erosion when the perovskite film is  exposed to ambient air.  Besides, the thermal st abilities of  the perovskite films were also tested at   $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   with   $25\\%$   RH  for   $500\\textrm{h}$  , and the XRD patterns are shown in Figure 5b. For  the control film, a high diffraction peak of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   appears after  heating treatment, resulting from the separation of A-site cation  from perovskite lattice. It has been verified that this decomposition process tends to start from the defect position with the  help of water and oxygen.  On the contrary, the PBGH/perovskite film only exhibits insignificant  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   diffraction peak, demonstrating the better thermal stability of the PBGH/perovskite  film, which is attributed to the robust perovskite structure and  the reduced surface trap states, consistent with the conclusion  obtained from the PL measurements.  \n\nThe control and PBGH/perovskite films were stored at   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    with   $60\\%$   RH for different time, and the steady–state photoluminescence measurements were carried out. As shown in  Figure  5c, both the fresh films exhibit narrow and strong PL  peaks at   $790\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . After aging for   $250\\,\\textrm{h}$  , the PL peak for the  control sample appears red shift and its FWHM is increased,  indicating the reduced perovskite quality and the increased  defects.  After   $500\\ \\mathrm{{h}'}$   aging test, the PL peak of the control film exhibits remarkable change in shape, suggesting the  formation of other phases,  which is ascribed to the decomposition and phase-transition of the  ɑ -phase perovskite film.  By contrast, the PL spectrum of the PBGH/perovskite film  appears negligible change after aging for   $500\\textrm{h}$  , demonstrating  the enhanced thermal and moisture stability of the PBGH/ perovskite film.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/95793daced1e77eec0acb9b6b390631cb04257625cc8e3049c5abca30f942e5a-1727105902.jpg)  \nFigure   5.   XRD patterns for control and PBGH/perovskite films aged at a) RH:  ${\\approx}85\\%$  ,  $\\mathsf{T}\\!\\!:\\approx\\!\\!25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C};$   and b) RH:  ${\\approx}25\\%$  , T:  $\\approx\\!85~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .
