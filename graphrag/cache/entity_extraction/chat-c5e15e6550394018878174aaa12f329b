CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The  WF values are close to those obtained from the UPS measurements, which suggests that the   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$  treatment can effectively  decrease the WF of the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene nanosheets by replacing  the surface terminated  $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups with   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   groups.  \n\nThe WF of the semiconductor is defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level   $(E_{\\mathrm{vac}})$   and its Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$  .   The WF difference of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene caused by different surface terminated groups are analyzed according to the movement  of the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$   and   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$  . As illustrated in  Figure   3 a, the surface terminated   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   groups with strong electron-donating ability will  increase the electron density of the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene by donating  electrons to the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{C}$  , which causes the   $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}$   to move upward. At  the same time, a surface dipole moment directed from Nb layer  (negative end) to the   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   groups (positive end) is generated,  and an electric field directed from the  $-\\mathrm{OH}$   groups to Nb layer  is formed, which will shift down the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$  . Consequently, the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene with   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   terminated surface groups exhibit  lower WF compared with the bare   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{C}_{1}$  , which is consistent  with the first-principles calculations.  For the surface terminated   $-\\mathrm{F}$  groups, the Nb layer transfer electrons to both the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups and the underneath C layer, resulting in a downshift of the  $E_{\\mathrm{{F}}}$  . However, the underneath C layer gets more electrons than the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups, which results in a negative dipole  moment though the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups are negatively charged.  The  surface dipole moment directed from Nb layer (negative end)  to the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups (positive end) causes the downshift of the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$  . At this point, the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups have little effect on the WF of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene. Similar to the   $-\\mathrm{OH}$   groups, the surface terminated   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   groups with electron-donating ability upshift the   $E_{\\mathrm{F}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene and the surface dipole moment directed  from Nb layer (negative end) to the   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   groups (positive end)  causes the downshift of the   $E_{\\mathrm{vac}},$  , resulting in a decreased WF  compared with the bare   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{C}$  . The XPS and FITR measurements reveal that the   $-\\mathrm{F}$   groups are gradually replaced with  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/df0d1f44367049ecdec38b69ecbb94cb2e5fc0da56200ef445011a23121cbdff-1727104696.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   a) The schematic diagram of the Fermi level   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$   and vacuum level   $(E_{\\mathrm{vac}})$   movement induced by different surface functional groups   $(-O H$  ,   $-\\mathsf{F},-\\mathsf{N H}_{2})$  ). b) The energy level diagram of the  $\\mathsf{P}\\!\\!-\\!\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{C T}_{x}$   MXene and   $\\mathsf{N b}_{2}\\mathsf{C T}_{x}$   MXene treated with   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}\\mathsf{H}_{4}$   at different times.

The increment of   $\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}$   groups will reduce the WF of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene,  as illustrated in Figure  3b. The WF values of   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene  treated with   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   for 3, 7, 12   $\\scriptstyle\\left({\\mathrm{T}}{\\mathrm{:}}{\\mathrm{Nb}}_{2}{\\mathrm{CT}}_{x}\\right)$  ), and   $^{18\\mathrm{~h~}}$  decrease  to 4.53, 4.41, 4.34, and   $4.34~\\mathrm{eV}$   from   $4.65\\,\\mathrm{\\:eV}$   of the   $\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{-}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene. The   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   treated   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene with decreased WF  is beneficial to transport photo-generated electrons from the  perovskite layer to the ITO electrode, thus improving the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  of the PVSCs. High transmittance is of great importance for  the ETL in n-i-p configuration PVSCs because it determines  the amount of light absorbed by the perovskite active layer. The  pristine and the  $\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$   treated   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene films shown high  transmittance in the wavelength from 300 to  $800\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure S5,  Supporting Information). The electrical conductivity of these   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene films is measured and the results are shown  in Table S1, Supporting Information. The electrical conductivity   $(\\delta)$   values of the   $\\mathrm{P}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene and T ${\\mathrm{Nb}}_{2}{\\mathrm{CT}}_{x}$   MXene films  are   $3.43\\times10^{3}$   and   $4.78\\times10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{S\\m}^{-1}$  . The higher conductivity of   $\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{:}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{b}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$  MXene film may be attributed to the enhanced electron density aroused from the   $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$   groups, which is beneficial to improve the electron transport efficiency.  \n\nThe matched energy level alignment at the ETL/perovskite  interface is of vital importance for photo-generated electrons  transport from the perovskite layer to the ETL and finally collected by the electrode. The mechanism of charge transport process and band-bending at the   $\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{CT}_{x}$   MXene/  $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Cs}_{0.15}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  interface are further analyzed according to the Schottky–Mott  limit on the basis of the relative alignment of energy levels. The energy level of perovskite is measured by UPS measurement and Kubelka-Munk plot, as shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information.
