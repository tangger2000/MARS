CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

The electrons are reconfigured to form  self-trapped excitons which usually emit broadband spectrum.  In the electron diffraction pattern (Figure 1d), the crystal structure of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC is confirmed to be an ortho rhombi c system,  which is consistent with the results of SCXRD. The diffraction  spots are confirmed as   $(-200)$   and (001) along   $b$   direction, and  the inter planar spacing is measured as   $0.314\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure S2,  Supporting Information). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; Figure 1e) shows that the defect-free  crystal has a complete crystal lattice. In XRD pattern (Figure 1f),  highly oriented diffraction peaks indicate that the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC  has high crystalline quality.  \n\nWe further studied the photo physical properties of 1D   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SCs. The reflection spectra and excitation spectra at  room temperature are shown in  Figure    2 a. In the reflection  spectrum, a strong absorption is located at about   $328~\\mathrm{nm}$  , and  the optical bandgap is calculated to be about   $3.78~\\mathrm{eV}.$  . At about   $425\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , the crystal also has a significant absorption, which  can be explained by exciton absorption. And in the excitation  spectrum, the crystal has the highest excitation efficiency at  about   $347\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , which is consistent with the reflection spectrum. Figure  2b is the photo luminescence (PL) spectrum at   $80~\\mathrm{K}$  . The PL spectrum has a wide full-width at half-maximum  (FWHM,   ${\\approx}75\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  ) and the luminescence peak is located at   $568\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . This broad emission is similar to the white light  from black body radiation, which is usually used for illumination. It is well known that self-trapped excitons are caused  by lattice distortion in excited states, which usually exist in  semiconductors with localized carriers and soft lattices.  In  the past reports, emission from self-trapped excitons is generally considered as the reason for broadband emission of metal  halide.  Similarly, we attribute the broadband luminescence of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   to self-trapped excitons recombination, in  whose mechanism the distortion of lattice is the main cause  of Stokes shift.  In other words, large Stokes shift means  strong lattice distortion. In our work, the emission of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  has a highly Stokes shift of   $1.51~\\mathrm{eV},$   which demonstrates the  self-trapped exciton recombination. In addition, the large  ℏ ω  also confirms a strong electron–phonon coupling which  is necessary to form self-trapped exciton. In Commission  Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromatic it y coordinates  (Figure 2c), the full emission spectrum of CsCuI SC is determined at (0.345, 0.364). The center wavelength is   $567.4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  and the correlated color temperature is   $5035\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{K}}$   which belongs  to a warm white-light emission.  \n\nFigure 2d shows the PL decays of 1D  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC measured at   $568~\\mathrm{nm}$   and at room temperature. The average photo generated  carrier’s lifetime is about 63.6 ns, which is obtained by fitting  the PL decay curve with second-order decay function, similar to  that of Pb-based perovskite SCs. The absolute PLQY is shown  in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. The white-light  PLQY of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC is between   $12\\%$   and   $16\\%$  , which is comparable to the current highest organic Pb halides.  To observe  the high PLQY,  Table   1  shows the calculated radiative recombination rate   $(k_{\\mathrm{r}})$   and non radiative recombination rate   $(k_{\\mathrm{nr}})$   of  the white-light emission of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC. The results show that  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC has fast   $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$   Therefore, the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  SCs has  high-efficiency white-light emission. The fast radiation recombination benefits from the high crystalline quality of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/e12b073a3e4a8a24fdc6fb70ccc92fba788c2d4ed21e5f692a2e0aa6b3e1ea6a-1723834866.jpg)  \nFigure 2.  $\\mathsf{C s C u}_{2}\\vert_{3}$   SC. a) Ultraviolet excitation spectrum collected at   $568\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   and reflection spectrum. b) PL spectrum of 1D   $\\mathsf{C s C u}_{2}\\vert_{3}$   SCs at  $325\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   excitation at 80 K. c) CIE chromatic it y coordinate of the 1D  $\\mathsf{C s C u}_{2}\\vert_{3}$   SCs. d) The PL decays of the 1D perovskite crystal at room  temperature.  \n\nSCs (non radiative recombination due to defects) and effective  exciton recombination mechanisms.  \n\nFigure    3 a shows the temperature-dependent PL spectrum.  At room temperature, the PL spectrum shows two emitting  peaks, corresponding to radiative recombination of two different excitonic states   $(\\mathrm{X}_{1}$   and   $X_{2}$  ). For the   $X_{2}$   exciton, as the  temperature decreases, the PL intensity increases significantly  and the FWHM gradually decreases. We notice that the emission from the   $X_{1}$   exciton disappears at low temperatures. Such  temperature-enhanced exciton emission may require a phonon’s assisting. In other words, excitons need to be thermally  activated.  In the   $X_{2}$   exciton, the emission peaks show a  slight blueshift with increasing temperature. Different from  the conventional direct interband radiation recombination, this  exciton emission is featured by:   $E_{\\mathrm{e}}=\\,E_{\\mathrm{g}}\\,-\\,E_{\\mathrm{b}}$  , where   $E_{\\mathrm{e}}$   is the  emission energy, and   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   is the exciton binding energy whose  intensity usually depends on the localized extent of exciton.  Emission energy increases (blueshift) with increasing temperature, which may be due to the thermal expansion and electron– phonon interaction.

The blue peak disappears in low-temperature PL spectrum, which may be due to a suppression of the  corresponding exciton   $(\\mathrm{X_{1}})$   recombination.
