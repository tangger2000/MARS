CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Figure 5h displays the fitting curves of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and   $P_{\\mathrm{light}}$   according to the Equation of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\,\\propto\\,n k T/q\\,\\ln P_{\\mathrm{light}},$   where   $n$   is the ideal factor,   $k$   is the  Boltzmann constant,   $T$  is the Kelvin temperature, and   $q$   is  the elementary charge.  When the   $n$   value is close to 2, the  trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall recombination is dominant  in the devices.  Compared with the   $n$   value (1.87) of the control device without CBL, all of PVSCs employed CBL show a  lower fitted slope. In particular, the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device  exhibits the significantly lowest  n  value of 1.68, indicating that  TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL could more effectively reduce the trapassisted recombination.  \n\nThe effects of CBLs on the trap density and electron transport are quantitatively investigated by space-charge limited  current (SCLC) method with electron-only device structure of   $\\mathrm{ITO/SpO_{2}/M A P b I_{3}/P C B M/C B L/A g}$  . As shown in Figure 5i, the  double logarithmic plot of  $J{-}V$   curve contains three regions: an  ohmic response region   $(J\\propto\\,V)$  , a trap-filled limited (TFL) current region   $(J\\propto V^{n}$  ,   $n>3$  ), and a SCLC region   $(J\\propto V^{2})$  .  The  electron mobility   $(\\upmu_{e})$   of the device is caculated with the Equation of   $J\\,{=}\\,\\frac{9\\varepsilon_{r}\\varepsilon_{0}\\mu_{e}V^{2}}{8L^{3}}$  , where   $L$   is the thickness of perovskite  film,   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   is the relative dielectric constant and   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum  dielectric constant.   $V$   is the applied voltage. The TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    based device exhibits the highest   $\\upmu_{e}$   of   $3.3\\,\\times\\,10^{-5}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$    in three kinds of cells, contributing to more efficient charge  transport and extraction. The relationship between the initial  TFL voltage (  $(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}})$   and trap density   $(n_{\\mathrm{t}})$   can be described by the  Equation of   $V_{_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}=\\frac{q n_{t}L^{2}}{2\\varepsilon_{r}\\varepsilon_{0}}$  . The   $n_{\\mathrm{t}}$   values of the devices without  CBL, with  $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL and with TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL are calculated to be   $3.85\\times10^{16}$  ,   $2.27\\times10^{16}$  , and   $9.07\\times10^{15}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  , respectively. This result demonstrates that the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL  can remarkably improve interface contact quality and passivate  electronic defects.  We verified that   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL can  improve electrical conductivity and passivate PCBM/Ag interfacial defects, thereby increasing charge transport and reducing  charge recombination. Moreover, the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL with  higher electrical conductivity enables optimization of energy  level structure and effective inhibition of iodine ions migration  from perovskite layer to  $\\mathrm{Ag}$   cathode, thus realizing efficient carrier transport for higher photovoltaic performance.  \n\nFinally, the operational robustness of the PVSCs is also  investigated by humidity and thermal stability test as shown  in  Figure   7 . Figure  $7\\mathrm{a}$   displays the PCE changes of the devices  stored in air, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  S6 (Supporting Information). Compared to  the control device, the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  based device is more stable  and maintains   $70\\%$   of its initial PCE, while the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    based device exhibits further increased air stability with   $88\\%$    of the initial PCE. The performance evolutions of the devices  at   $85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in nitrogen atmosphere are summarized in Figure 7b  and Table  S7 (Supporting Information). After thermal aging  for   $100\\textrm{h}$  , the PCE of the control device without CBL rapidly  drops to   $18\\%$   of the initial PCE, and the  $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   based device  possesses slightly better thermal stability with   $50\\%$   of the initial PCE. However, the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  based device still retains   $85\\%$   of the initial PCE, showing significantly better thermal  stability. Compared with the control device and the   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$    based device, the TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$  based device exhibits obviously improved operational stability, which may be attributed  to the obviously enhanced charge extraction and the effective  inhibition of iodine ions migration from perovskite layer to   $\\mathrm{Ag}$    cathode by the TBAB $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL.

However, the aged device with TBAB  $\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL  exhibits the weakest accumulation of iodine ions at the PCBM/ Ag interface compared to the aged devices without CBL and  with   $\\mathsf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{Ti}_{3}\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{x}}$   CBL, which contributes to the improved operational stability.  \n\n# 3.
