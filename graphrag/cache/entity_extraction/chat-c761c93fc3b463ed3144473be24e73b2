As a proof-of-concept experiment, LED devices are constructed by coupling green-emitting   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  glass powders,  red-emitting   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{I}_{1.5}@$  glass powders, and the mixture of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  glass and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{I}_{1.5}@$  glass powders with   $460~\\mathrm{nm}$  blue LED chip. The as-prepared LED devices yield extremely  bright green, red, and white luminescence at an operating bias  of   $3\\;\\mathrm{V}$   (insets of  Figure   5 a–c). This voltage is applied on the blue  chip, which can be completely absorbed by   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  glass  LCM (Figure 5a) and  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{I}_{1.5}@$  glass one (Figure 5b) to pro- duce pure green and red light. When coupling with appropriate  amount of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  glass and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{1.5}\\mathrm{I}_{1.5}@,$  glass LCMs,  the device can produce a combined white light consisting of   $460~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   blue (LED chip),   $517\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   green   $(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{glass})$   and   $640\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   red (  $(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}\\mathrm{I}_{1.5}@\\mathrm{glass})$   tri-color narrowband emissions (Figure  5c). By optimizing the ratio of red to green  PeQDs  $@$  glass powders, red/green/blue tri-color intensities can  be finely tuned, and the as-prepared wLED can produce cool,  pure, and warm white light (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The device performance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}X_{3}@$  glass-based LEDs  is summarized in Figure 5d–f. The green, red and white LED  devices show high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of   $15.1\\%$  ,   $8.0\\%$  , and   $13.8\\%$   at low operating currents, respectively, which  will gradually decrease with increase of current. The power efficiency for the constructed wLED is   $25.8\\ \\mathrm{lm}\\ \\mathbb{W}^{-1}$  . Fortunately,  the LEDs can achieve ultra-high luminance of 600 000 (green),  100 000 (red), and   $500\\,000\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   (white), respectively. Different  to the case of EQE, the luminance remains quite high value  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/03463cdc9e135baabdfc79c8166bc26a43c4ae21dde16942f5dbb7f467e9a9d6-1727105245.jpg)  \nFigure   5.   a–c) PL spectra for the constructed  $\\mathsf{C s P b X}_{3}\\emptyset$  glass converted green LED, red LED and white LED.
