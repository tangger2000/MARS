CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

The O 1s XPS results indicate that during OER process,  NiCo alloy has been hydroxyl a ted because the rich   ${C0}^{3+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}}$   might be beneficial to form the surface-hydrated oxides  and (oxy)hydroxides phases (e.g.,   $\\mathrm{Co(OH)}_{2},$  , CoOOH,   $\\mathrm{Ni(OH)}_{2}.$  ,  and NiOOH).  And those surface-hydrated oxides and (oxy) hydroxides species could provide the main reactive sites, which  might attribute to the enhancement during the OER process of  the sample with the loading of NiCo alloy nanoparticles.  As  shown in Figure 7d, C 1s can be de convoluted into   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$  ,  $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$  ,  and   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   whether before or after OER. In addition, after OER  process, the intensities of   $\\scriptstyle{C=C}$  ,   $_{\\mathrm{C-N}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   have not been  changed a lot, indicating that the carbon nanofibers are relatively stable during OER process.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, here we reported a simple and successful  approach for the synthesis of NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on N-doped carbon nanofibers as a highly active and  durable oxygen electro catalyst with low-cost. The hybrid catalyst with the right amount of NiCo alloy nanoparticles loading   $\\langle\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2\\rangle$  ) gives the most prominent ORR and OER electro catalytic performances, characterized with the most positive  specific potential (0.81 V vs RHE) at   $-3\\,\\,\\mathrm{mA\\,\\,cm}^{-2}$  , maximum  current densities of ORR   $(-6.54\\mathrm{~mA}\\mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$   at 0.06 V) and OER  (  $16.80\\,\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$   at   $1.96~\\mathrm{~V~}$  , which are even superior to the  commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   catalysts, respectively. Besides,  the   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   owns the smallest Tafel plot slopes for both  the ORR   $(-65~\\mathrm{mV}~\\mathrm{dec}^{-1})$  ) and OER   $(98\\:\\mathrm{mV}\\:\\mathrm{dec}^{-1})$  ) processes. The  synergetic effects between NiCo alloy nanoparticles and the  N-doped carbon fiber have been ascribed to the excellent catalytic activities of the hybrid catalyst, including of decreasing the  intrinsic and charge transfer resistances, increasing   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=C}}$  , graphitic-N/pyridinic-N contents in the hybrid catalyst, and the formation of highly active hydroxyl ation of   $\\mathrm{Ni/Co}$  . In addition, the  testing results of zinc–air batteries indicate that   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}\\hat{\\lambda}$  can be a feasible, highly efficient, and stable air catalyst with  low-cost. This work might open a simple and novel way to fabricate high-efficient, low-cost oxygen catalysts with high production, and shows great potential applications in various  renewable energy systems including fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and water splitting.  \n\n# 4. Experimental Section  \n\nThe Synthesis of NiCo@ N-C NFs : Typically, polyvinyl pyr ro li done \n\n  $((\\mathsf C_{6}\\mathsf H_{9}\\mathsf{N O})_{n},$   Alfa Aesar, M.W. 1 300 000, 0.5 g) and poly acrylonitrile \n\n  $\\big(\\big(\\mathsf{C}_{3}\\mathsf{H}_{3}\\mathsf{N}\\big)_{n},$   $0.5\\ \\mathrm{\\bf~g})$   were dissolved in  , - dimethyl form amide   $(\\mathsf C_{3}\\mathsf H_{7}\\mathsf{N O}$  , Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,  Ltd,   $\\mathsf{l o\\mum}$  ), then the mixed solution was stirred vigorously at room  temperature until to get a clear solution. Nickel(II) nitrate hex a hydrate   $(\\mathsf{N i}\\,(\\mathsf{N O}_{3})_{2}{\\cdot}6\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$  , Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) and Cobalt(II)  nitrate hex a hydrate   $(\\mathsf{C o}(\\mathsf{N O}_{3})_{2}{\\cdot}6\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$  , Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,  Ltd) were then added into the above mixed solution with four different  amounts of nickel and cobalt salts, which are: 0 mmol   $\\mathsf{N i}^{2+}+0$   mmol   ${\\mathsf{C}}{\\mathsf{o}}^{2+}$  , 0.25 mmol   $\\mathsf{N i}^{2+}+0.5$   mmol  ${\\mathsf{C}}{\\mathsf{o}}^{2+}$  , 0.5 mmol   $\\mathsf{N i}^{2+}+\\mathsf{\\Gamma}^{}$   mmol   ${\\mathsf{C}}{\\mathsf{o}}^{2+}$  , 1  mmol   $\\mathsf{N i}^{2+}+2$   mmol   ${\\mathsf{C}}{\\mathsf{o}}^{2+}$  , with constant molar ratio of 1:2 for  $\\mathsf{N i}^{2+}{:}\\mathsf{C o}^{2+}$  ,  and stirred overnight (denoted as   $\\mathsf{N}\\!\\!-\\!\\mathsf{C}$  ,   $\\mathsf{N i C o@N\\cdot C}$  1,   $\\mathsf{N i C o@N\\cdot C}$  2, and   $\\mathsf{N i C o@N\\cdot C\\3}$  , respectively). Finally, the precursor solutions of  electro spinning were obtained.  \n\nThe obtained mixed viscous solutions were inhaled into a plastic  syringe   $(5\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu})$   with a single stainless steel nozzle (  $0.4\\ m m$   of inner  diameter). In a typically electro spinning process, a high voltage of   $18{-}20~\\mathrm{kV}$   was applied, which was kept between the tip of a needle and  the collector coated with aluminum foil, and the distance between the  tip and the receiver was set to   $\\mathsf{10\\c m}$  . The injection speed of syringe was   $\\dot{0.1}\\!-\\!0.15\\ \\mathsf{m m\\m i n^{-1}}$  . After the spinning was finished, the obtained fabric  was taken off from the aluminum foil and transferred to a vacuum oven  kept at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for at least   $\\mathsf{T}2\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathsf{h}$  , in order to remove the moisture in the  obtained fabric. The dried fabric was further heated in  $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   atmosphere at   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $5\\;\\mathsf{h}$   in a tube furnace. The heating and cooling rates were both   $2~^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}~{\\mathsf{m i n}}^{-1}$  . After calcination, the target products NiCo  $@$   N-C NFs were  obtained successfully.  \n\nPhysical Characterization : The morphology and structures of the  as-made materials were characterized by SEM(Hitachi SU8010) and  HRTEM (FEI, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin). XRD (UK, Bede Scientific Ltd.;  $\\mathsf{C u K}$  α  radiation; operated at  $40\\:|\\mathsf{k V},45\\:\\mathsf{m A}$  ;  $\\lambda\\,{=}\\,0.15418\\;\\mathsf{n m})$  ) was used to measure  the crystal structures of the prepared samples. The scanning range was  from   $40^{\\circ\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
