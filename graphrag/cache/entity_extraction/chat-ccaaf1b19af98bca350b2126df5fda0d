CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

The STM/STS for untreated   $\\mathrm{(w/o\\V_{O}..)}$  ) and  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  annealed PBSCF films (with   $\\mathrm{V_{O}}{\\ddot{}}$  ) was carried out at room temperature at a base pressure of   $10^{-10}$   mbar.  \n\nThe surface morphology of PBSCF remained unchanged  after introducing oxygen vacancies by   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   annealing in the STM  chamber, with a surface roughness less than   $1\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   ( Figure   4 a).  Height profile of the STM image is shown in Figure S12b in  the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 4b, the band  gap of the film increased from the   $0.75\\pm0.08$   to   $0.94\\pm0.10\\ \\mathrm{eV}$  after treatment. Our observation is different from Xiao et al.’s  work, who reported that the creating of oxygen vacancies leads  to a decrease of band gap for  ${\\mathrm{Co}}_{3}{\\mathrm{O}}_{4}$  .  This result indicates that  the effects of oxygen vacancies strongly depend on the material systems and requires systematic investigation. Since larger  band gap is corresponding to lower electronic conductivity and  harder charge transfer process, our STM/S suggests that oxygen  vacancy-induced changes in surface electronic structure can be  detrimental for the OER performance of PBSCF.  It is noted  that the   $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$   in the Nyquist plots increased slightly after thermal  annealing (Figure 2c). Due to the test configuration, the electrons need to transport from the surface through the PBSCF  thin film to reach the embedded Au collector (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). As a result, the   $R_{s}$   is influenced by the  conductivity of the PBSCF thin film. The STM/S measurement showed that the increase in oxygen vacancy concentration  resulted in an increase in band gap (Figure  4b), leading to a  decrease in conductivity of PBSCF thin film after more oxygen  vacancies were introduced. Therefore, we observed an increase  in   $R_{s}$   with oxygen deficiency. In contrast to the slight increase  in   $R_{s}$   for the sample after thermal annealing, the   $R_{s}$   remained  unchanged for the PBSCF sample subjected to electrochemical  reduction (Figure S4c, Supporting Information). Since the  oxygen vacancies are mainly located in the surface region of the  electro chemically reduced film, they may have limited impact  on the electronic conductivity of the film and the   $R_{s}$   value.  \n\nThe position of O 2p band center relative to Fermi energy is  another electronic descriptor that has been widely used to correlate to the OER performance.  The lower O  $2p$   band center  position indicates a more stable lattice, higher oxygen vacancy  formation energy, and less oxygen-metal covalency, which are  detrimental for the OER performance. To further understand  the role of oxygen vacancies in determining the OER activity  of PBSCF, we carried out DFT calculation to investigate the  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/c4e6f287a7c3dfd6a73cd2bd80b6d65abab8c76d63ceeb9f2363940bb5d5503e-1727079906.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $(V_{\\mathrm{tip}}=2.5~\\lor,$   $I_{\\sf t u n e l}=80~\\mathsf{p A})$  ) and b) tunneling current spectra of the untreated film   $(\\mathsf{w}/\\circ\\mathsf{V}_{0}{\\cdots})$   and the one subjected to   $400~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$    thermal annealing for  $2\\,\\mathsf{h}$   in  $\\rceil\\dot{0}^{-6}$   mbar  $\\mathsf{H}_{2}$   environment (with  $\\mathsf{V}_{0}\\cdots$  ); c) DOS of the   $\\supset2p$  , Fe  $3d$  , and Co  $3d$   states for PBSCF with and without oxygen defect.  \n\ndefect-induced changes in   $\\mathrm{~O~}\\,2p$   band position. The electron  density of state (DOS) for PBSCF surface with and without the  surface oxygen vacancy with spin-polarized O 2 p , Co  $3d$  , and Fe   $3d$   orbitals is plotted in Figure 4c. Upon introducing a surface  vacancy, the O   $2p$   center shifts down relative to Fermi level, suggesting a detrimental effect of the defect-induced changes on  electronic structure in the OER performance.  \n\nThe combination of experimental and theoretical results  consistently indicates that excessive oxygen vacancies can have  competing impact on the OER activity of PBSCF. On the one  hand, oxygen vacancies in PBSCF resulted in better   $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$   affiliation and the lower theoretical energy to form   $\\mathrm{O^{*}}$  , which is  considered to the rate limiting step of OER on PBSCF. These  oxygen vacancies, on the other hand, led to larger band gap and  lower O  $2p$   band center, which are detrimental for the OER performance. The beneficial effect of the oxygen vacancies plays the  dominate role for PBSCF, which eventually leads to the overall  enhanced OER performance. Similar complex role of oxygen  vacancy can also exist in other transition metal oxide systems,  which can explain why there are both positive  and negative effects  of oxygen vacancies reported in literature.  \n\n# 2.4. Enhancing the Performance of PBSCF Powder (P) and NT  via Oxygen Defect Engineering  \n\nIn the previous part, we have demonstrated that the presence  of oxygen vacancies can improve the intrinsic OER activity of  PBSCF thin films. To guide the development of techniques that  can tune the oxygen defects control la bly for practical application, we further compared the different effects of thermal  annealing and electrochemical reduction on OER activity of  PBSCF powders (P) and NTs. The PBSCF powders were synthesized by Pechini process with particle size of   $5{-}10~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$  . The  PBSCF NTs were prepared by electro spinning with diameters  of  ${\\approx}80$   and  ${\\approx}200\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nElectrochemical test showed that the OER activity of PBSCF  powder was improved continuously as the annealing time  increased. The polarization curves for the pristine PBSCF  powder and the ones subjected to thermal annealing for different time length (P-Hx h) are shown in  Figure   5 a. The overpotential at   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   for the P-H-6h sample was decreased by   $50\\;\\mathrm{mV}$   compared to pristine ones. The Tafel plots (Figure S13a,  Supporting Information) and EIS spectra (Figure  5b) results  were consistent with the polarization curves. The Tafel slopes  continuously decreased from   $92\\,\\mathrm{\\mV\\,\\dec^{-1}}$   for the pristine  PBSCF powder to 80, 78, and   $72\\ \\mathrm{mV}\\ \\mathrm{dec}^{-1}$   for the ones subjected to 2, 4, and   $6\\mathrm{~h~}$   annealing, respectively. The EIS spectra  of PBSCF powder loaded on carbon paper showed characteristic semicircles, which consist of an ohmic resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$   and  a charge transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$  . The   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$   clearly decreased after  thermal annealing, indicating a more facilitated OER kinetic  after introducing oxygen vacancies.  All these results indicate  that by thermal annealing the PBSCF powder to  $6\\,\\mathrm{h}$  , the oxygen  deficiency in PBSCF has not reached the optimal value. In addition, it was found from the XRD analysis of the PBSCF after  the thermal annealing that CoO was not precipitated as shown  in Figure S14 in the Supporting Information. Further increase  of the oxygen deficiency by prolonging thermal annealing time  length (8 h) or increasing thermal annealing temperatures   $(600\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  , however, led to the decomposition of the PBSCF  material (Figure S15, Supporting Information).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
