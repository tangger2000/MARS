CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

In the   $J{-}V$  curves, the linear response at lower bias  and the sharp current increase at higher bias are assigned to  the Ohmic-type and trap-filling regions, respectively.  The  junction of these two regions is defined as the trap-filling limit  voltage   $\\mathrm{(V_{TFL})}$   and the trap state density   $\\mathrm{\\left(N_{t}\\right)}$   can be estimated by  the following equation  \n\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{t}}\\,{=}\\,2V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\mathbfcal{E}_{r}\\mathbfcal{E}_{0}/e L^{2}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\mathrm{L}$   refers to the thickness of the film,   $e$  is the electron  charge,   $\\varepsilon_{r}$   and   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   are the dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity. Thereinto,   $\\varepsilon_{r}$   can be expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{r}=C L/\\varepsilon_{0}S\n$$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/0498fbe877eeb7c78c570f453887c83cec4029d0f34cd54542b4e636c2179fdc-1727105998.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   EL performance of sky-blue PeLEDs. a) Current density-voltage-luminance   $(J{-}V{-}L)$   characteristics. b) EQE curves as a function of luminance. c) EL spectra of BAP-modified device under various driving voltages. The inset is the photograph of a large-area BAP-modified sky-blue PeLED.  d) Statistical chart of the peak EQEs of pristine and BAP-modified devices.  \n\nwhere C is the geometrical capacitance and S represents the  area of the film. By the capacitance-frequency ( C–F ) curves  (Figure  2e), the BAP-modification can hardly change the C  value of perovskite film, especially within the low frequency  region, indicating that   $\\varepsilon_{r}$   can be a constant. Hence, the lower   $\\mathrm{V_{TFL}}$   obtained by employing BAP implies the less concentration of trap states in perovskite film (Figure 2d). The TRPL and  SCLC results prove the effective defect pass iv ation for pervoskite film by applying BAP-modification and its mechanism can  be elucidated by alleviating the negative effects of halide ion  behavior as illustrated in Figure 1c.  \n\nApart from the investigation on perovskite films, the  electrical and luminescent regulations for sky-blue PeLEDs  through BAP-modification have been uncovered as well. Both  pristine and BAP-modified PeLEDs were constructed with a  device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly(9-vinyl car baz ole)   $(\\mathrm{PVK})/\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Cl}/\\mathrm{Br})_{3}$   perovskite/CN-T2T/LiF/Al. Here, ITO,  PEDOT:PSS/PVK,   $\\mathsf{C s P b}(\\mathrm{Cl}/\\mathrm{Br})_{3}$   perovskite, CN-T2T, and LiF/ Al were employed as the anode, HTL, sky-blue emitting layer,  electron transport layer (ETL), and bilayer cathode, respectively. The cross-sectional SEM image and schematic energy  levels of the devices are displayed in Figure S5 (Supporting  Information). As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), the valence and conduction bands of perovskite films  are determined by the ultraviolet photo emission spectroscopy (UPS), together with the Tauc plot analysis of absorption  spectra. From the cross-sectional SEM image, the thicknesses  of the HTL, perovskite layer, and ETL are estimated to be 33,  20, and   $35~\\mathrm{nm}$   on average, respectively. The time-resolved EL  (TREL) measurement was carried out to examine the fluorescence decay in devices (Figure S7, Supporting Information).  Consistent with the result of TRPL, the TREL curve of BAPmodified PeLED displays distinctly prolonged decay lifetime  after an electrical pulse, offering the strong evidence for the  lower trap density. Considering the apparent morphological  evolution of perovskite film by using BAP, impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurement was then implemented for normally working PeLEDs to study their charge transport and  recombination characteristics (Figure  2f). When both the  devices are driven under the same bias, the arc radius in  Nyquist plot of the BAP-modified device is much smaller  than that of the pristine one. This variation reveals the significantly reduced charge-transfer resistance, which can be  expected to be favorable for enhancing the EL performance  of PeLEDs. We speculate that the improved electrical property  probably arises from the optimized contact interface between  hole transport layer (HTL) and BAP-modified perovskite film  assembled by compact and uniform crystal grains. To verify  the effectiveness of BAP-modification, the overall performance of PeLEDs has been evaluated by collecting their EL  characteristics. To ensure the preciseness and reliability of  data comparison, all the devices were fabricated in the same  batch. The current density-voltage   $(J-V)$   curves of PeLEDs  illustrates that the BAP-modification can largely reduce the  current leakage at lower bias and slightly elevate the injected  current at higher bias ( Figure   3 a). Such a variation is ascribed  to the result of suppressed perovskite defects in cooperation  with optimized charge transfer. The BAP-modified device  \n\nexhibits a maximum luminance of 1147  cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  , which is  over twice that of pristine device. As plotted in Figure 3b, the  BAP-modified device achieves remarkably improved EQE as  compared with that of the pristine one, reaching a peak value  of   $16.58\\%$  . By applying hemisphere lens for suppressing the  light total reflection at the glass/air interface, the peak EQE of  BAP-modified device is further boosted to   $28.82\\%$  . In addition  to this batch, we have obtained a champion device with a peak  EQE as high as  $18.65\\%$   based on BAP-modification (Figure S8,  Supporting Information). To the best of our knowledge, the  EQE values achieved in this work are the highest ones among  all the reported data for sky-blue PeLEDs   $\\lambda\\leq486~\\mathrm{nm})$   based  on thin-film method (Table S2, Supporting Information).  Besides, the BAP-modified PeLEDs present excellent spectrally stable EL with increasing driven bias and the spectral  peaks maintain at   $483\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   (Figure  3c), which demonstrates  the minimized halide ion migration under electrical stimulation. The inset shows a large-scale BAP-modified PeLED   $(2\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\times2\\ \\mathrm{cm})$  ) featuring uniform and bright sky-blue emission. Both pristine and BAP-modified PeLEDs show a narrowband emission with the full width at half maximum (FWHM)   $<25\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , enabling outstanding color purity with the Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinate around  (0.09, 0.19) (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the BAP-modified PeLEDs show decent reproducibility  with an average peak EQE of   $14.73\\%$   obtained from 40 individual devices (Figure 3d).
