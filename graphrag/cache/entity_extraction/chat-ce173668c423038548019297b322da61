CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

As a contrast, the SEM  image of pristine   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   material exhibits the bulk morphology that may be ascribed to the higher reactant concentration of S by using the sulfur powder as reactant (Figure 1b; and  Figure S4b, Supporting Information). Moreover, the detailed  structural and phase information has been evaluated by the  X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). As shown in  Figure   2 a, all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to hexagonal   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   (JCPDS  44-1418) and Ni foam substrate (JCPDS 04-0850) and without  any additional diffraction peaks of other impurities, indicating  the high quality of as-obtained   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   3D electrode. Meanwhile, the HRTEM image of   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   (Figure 2b) exhibits two  distinct lattice fringes of 0.238 and   $0.287\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , which are consistent with the (003) and (110) lattice plane of the  $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   sample,  respectively.  Furthermore, the corresponding elemental mapping results confirmed that the uniform spatial distribution of  Ni (blue), S (orange), N (yellow) elements in the as-prepared   $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   sample, suggesting the successfully introduction of   $_\\mathrm{N}$  elements (Figure 2c).  \n\nThe further chemical states information of the   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$  sample was investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectro­ scopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 2d, the high-resolution XPS  spectrum of   $\\mathrm{Ni}~2\\mathrm{p}$   shows two main peaks located at 856 and   $874~\\mathrm{eV},$   which can be ascribed to   $\\mathrm{Ni}~2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$   and Ni   $\\mathrm{2\\mathfrak{p}_{1/2}}$  , respectively.  Meanwhile, the satellite peaks at 861.3 and   $880.1~\\mathrm{eV}$  can be assigned to shakeup type peaks of Ni, and a small peak  located at the binding energy of   $852.9\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{~\\mathrm{eV}}}$   can be attributed  to the   $\\mathrm{Ni}~2\\mathrm{p}$   signal originating from the Ni foam substrate.  Figure 2e shows that the core-level scan spectrum of   $\\textsl{S2p}$   can  be divided into two main characteristic peaks at 162.4 and   $163.6\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   which can be ascribed to the   $\\textsl{S2p}_{3/2}$   and   $\\mathrm{~S~}2\\mathsf{p}_{1/2}$  , respectively. Moreover, the high-resolution spectrum of N 1s in  Figure 2f shows a distinct peak located at the binding energy  of   $398.2~\\mathrm{eV}$   that can be assigned to the Ni-N feature bonds, further confirming that the N elements have been successfully  doped into the   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}S_{2}$   product. Based on the above discussions,  the N-decorated   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$   material has been successfully grown  on the Ni foam substrate to form the 3D   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   electrode  material.  \n\nThe OER electro catalytic activities of the as-obtained  $\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/$  NF 3D electrode were evaluated using a three-electrode configuration in a   $1\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{MHz}}$   solution. As shown in  Figure   3 a, the  oxidation peaks located around   $1.38~\\mathrm{V}$   (vs RHE) are assigned to   $\\mathrm{Ni^{II}}$   to   $\\mathrm{Ni^{III}}$  , which have been discovered in most of Ni-based  electro catalysts.  Obviously, the   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   shows a relative  lower onset potential than that of   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   and NF, and the  current density of   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   is much higher than that of pristine  $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   and blank NF at a same potential. For example, at  the over potential of   $0.35~\\mathrm{V},$  , the current density of   $\\mathrm{N{\\cdot}N i_{3}S_{2}/N F}$   is   $170\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , which is about 9 times and 40 times higher than  that of   $\\mathrm{Ni}_{3}\\mathrm{S}_{2}/\\mathrm{NF}$   and NF electrodes, respectively.
