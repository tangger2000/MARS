CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals coated with zirconium oxide, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>Synthesis method<|>Modified method used to obtain CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsBr<|>Reagent<|>Cesium bromide, a source of cesium ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbBr2<|>Reagent<|>Lead bromide, a source of lead ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve CsBr and PbBr2, abbreviated as DMF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OAm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Intermediate product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals formed before ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>Precursor<|>Zirconium butoxide, precursor for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZrO2<|>Coating material<|>Zirconium oxide, used to coat CsPbBr3 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Room temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the synthesis was carried out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.4 mmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of PbBr2 and CsBr used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of DMF used to dissolve PbBr2 and CsBr)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.2 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OAm used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.6 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OA used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1500 rpm<|>Reaction condition<|>Speed of vigorous stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10s<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>60 µmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 used for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8500 rpm<|>Purification condition<|>Speed of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 min<|>Purification condition<|>Duration of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The modified super saturated recrystallization method is used to synthesize CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsBr<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>CsBr is a source of cesium ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbBr2<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>PbBr2 is a source of lead ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CsBr<|>DMF is used to dissolve CsBr<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbBr2<|>DMF is used to dissolve PbBr2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OA acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OAm acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Toluene acts as an antisolvent to induce the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>ZrO2<|>Zr(OC4H9)4 is the precursor for ZrO2 coating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZrO2<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>ZrO2 forms a coating on CsPbBr3 NCs to create CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Room temperature<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs is carried out at room temperature<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm is used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Centrifugation at 8500 rpm is used to purify CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: mathrm{~}\\mathrm{eV})$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$     $(-4.16~\\mathrm{eV})$   significantly limited the photo voltage output for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs with large   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$  . The higher-lying CBM of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$     $(-4.21~\\mathrm{eV})$   offers a desirable energy level alignment with the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film. It also  provides a favorable matching of cascade energy band between  the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL and the perovskite layer, which  facilitates effective extraction of photo generated electrons from  the perovskite layer to ITO electrode. In addition, the cascadetype VBM formed at the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/Z n O/\\Omega}$  perovskite interface also  provides better hole-blocking property with improved electron  selectivity at the cathode.  Figure   3 a depicts the  $J{-}V$  character istics of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs with different ETLs and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in  Table   1 . The   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL-based solar cells outperformed those  based on sole   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , with a simultaneous increase in   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   FF,  and  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $1.23~\\mathrm{V},$  ,  $78.8\\%$  , and   $15.0\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively, leading  to a much higher PCE of   $14.6\\%$  . To the best of our knowledge,  it is one of the highest PCE for all-inorganic halide PVSCs  reported to date (Table S1, Supporting Information). The optimized thicknesses for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   stack are   $30/10~\\mathrm{nm}$  . Further increasing thickness of  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   reduced device efficiency due  to the increase in electrical resistance of the thicker  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , which  could be supported by the increase in device series resistance  (Table S3, Figure S4, Supporting Information). The significant  PCE enhancement in the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL modified  devices can be mainly attributed to the enhancement in both   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and FF. The increase of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   by   $0.17\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   in the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/Z n O}.$  - based device compared with the control device was consistent  with the higher-lying CBM of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  , which aligns energetically  with the perovskite CBM and thus maximizes the built-in  potential of the PVSC with small   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$  . The improvement in  FF can be attributed to a reduction in the leakage and recombination path, supported by the enhancement in device shunt  resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{p}})$   from 2547.9 to   $3789.4~\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   in the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}.$  - and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -modified devices, respectively. To further evaluate  the effect of energy level matching on the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement, we  also fabricated PVSCs based on single   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETL and their photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table S3 and Figure S4  (Supporting Information). Although the magnitude of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$    improvement in the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  -based reference cells is not as large  as those in the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -based devices, an obvious increase  in   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   was still observed when compared to the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -based  reference devices, whereas the corresponding   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF were  decreased in comparison to those of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based devices,  which can be attributed to the relatively poor conductivity and  large series resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$   of the devices. It is worth noting  that all the measured   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   in our study were well matched with  the photo current density calculated by integrating the external  quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum with an error below   $5\\%$    (Figure 3b).  \n\nAs shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), negligible  hysteresis with high reproducibility was achieved in the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/}$   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  -modified   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  PVSCs. The time dependence of the  power output of the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayer- and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -modified  PVSCs was further evaluated by tracking their efficiencies  under maximum power-point conditions (Figure 3c). Both  the   $\\mathrm{{snO}_{2}/Z n O}.$   and sole   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -modified PVSCs exhibited a  highly stable power output, which may rule out the issue of  efficiency variation caused by light soaking effects.  We also  monitored the long-term thermal stability of un encapsulated \n\n  $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$  -based   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs and organic–inorganic \n\n  $(\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3})_{1-x}(\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3})_{x}$   PVSCs based on a widely used perovskite composition by continually heating the cells at   $85\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    in glove box (Figure 3d). As expected, the organic–inorganic  hybrid PVSCs were subjected to significant PCE loss, whereas  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs had retained   $80\\%$   of their original PCE  after   $300\\:\\mathrm{{h}}$   of heating at  $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.$  . The PCE loss of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSC  is mainly originated from the drop of photo current (Figure S6d,  Supporting Information), which could be attributed to the photoinduced phase segregation observed in some mixed halide  perovskite.
