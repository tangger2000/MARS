CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals coated with zirconium oxide, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>Synthesis method<|>Modified method used to obtain CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsBr<|>Reagent<|>Cesium bromide, a source of cesium ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbBr2<|>Reagent<|>Lead bromide, a source of lead ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve CsBr and PbBr2, abbreviated as DMF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OAm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Intermediate product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals formed before ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>Precursor<|>Zirconium butoxide, precursor for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZrO2<|>Coating material<|>Zirconium oxide, used to coat CsPbBr3 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Room temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the synthesis was carried out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.4 mmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of PbBr2 and CsBr used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of DMF used to dissolve PbBr2 and CsBr)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.2 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OAm used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.6 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OA used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1500 rpm<|>Reaction condition<|>Speed of vigorous stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10s<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>60 µmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 used for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8500 rpm<|>Purification condition<|>Speed of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 min<|>Purification condition<|>Duration of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The modified super saturated recrystallization method is used to synthesize CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsBr<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>CsBr is a source of cesium ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbBr2<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>PbBr2 is a source of lead ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CsBr<|>DMF is used to dissolve CsBr<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbBr2<|>DMF is used to dissolve PbBr2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OA acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OAm acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Toluene acts as an antisolvent to induce the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>ZrO2<|>Zr(OC4H9)4 is the precursor for ZrO2 coating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZrO2<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>ZrO2 forms a coating on CsPbBr3 NCs to create CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Room temperature<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs is carried out at room temperature<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm is used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Centrifugation at 8500 rpm is used to purify CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: C u}_{0.2}\\mathsf{Z n}_{0.2})\\mathsf{O}/(\\mathsf{F e}_{0.2}\\mathsf{C o}_{0.2}\\mathsf{N i}_{0.2}\\mathsf{C u}_{0.2}\\mathsf{Z n}_{0.2})\\mathsf{F e}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{4}$  oxides were obtained at a sintering temperatures of 1000, 1100, 1200, and   $1300~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  , denoted by HE-Fe-1000, HE-Fe-1100, HE-Fe-1200, and HE-Fe-1300,  respectively.  \n\nCharacterization :  Phase  identification  for  HE  ceramics  was  characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advanced, Bruker,  Germany) using Cu   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$   radiation   $(\\lambda=0.15406~\\mathsf{n m}$  ). X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi) was applied to detect  the elemental chemical state of the HE oxide ceramics. The morph o logie s  were observed on a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM,  JEOL JSM-7001F), and the corresponding electron back scatter diffraction  (EBSD) maps were collected. The defects and vacancies were detected  using an electron spin resonance spectrometer (ESR, JEOL JES FA200).  The micro structure and high-resolution micro structure were characterized  via transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F) using  an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford) and spherical  aberration-corrected TEM (FEI Titan Cubed G2 300) associated with a  Super-X energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector, respectively. The  magnetic properties of HE oxide ceramics were analyzed using a vibrating  sample magneto meter (VSM, LakeShore-7404). The sample used for the  TEM characterization was prepared using the focused ion beam slicing  technique (FIB, Helios   ${\\mathsf{G}}4~{\\mathsf{C}}{\\mathsf{X}})$  ). An ion beam was generated by a metal  ion source, then, it was accelerated by an ion gun, focused, and irradiated  on the sample surface to peel the surface atoms with a strong current ion  beam for complete the micro- and nano-surface morphology processing.  To prevent Ga-ion beam damage, a   $1.2~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   thick Pt layer comprising a   $200\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   thick electron beam-assisted formed Pt layer and a   $1~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$   thick  Ga-ion beam-assisted deposited Pt layer was utilized.  Additional  characterizations are presented in Supporting Information.  \n\nThe EM parameters, i.e., the relative complex permittivity   $(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}\\ =$     $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}-j\\varepsilon^{\\prime\\prime})$   and permeability   $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{r}}=\\mu^{\\prime}-j\\mu^{\\prime\\prime})$   were determined by a vector  network analyzer (Keysight, N5234A) using the wave-guide method  in the frequency range of   $8.2{-}12.4~\\mathsf{G H z}$  , where the HE oxides were  cut into samples with dimensions of   $22.8\\ \\mathsf{m m}\\times10.1\\ \\mathsf{m m}\\times2.5\\ \\mathsf{m m}$    for measurements.  According to the metal back-panel theory, the  reflection loss (RL), which represents the microwave absorption  performance, was simulated based on the tested EM parameters as  follows:  \n\n$$\nR L=20\\mathsf{l o g}_{10}\\big|\\big(Z_{\\mathsf{i n}}-Z_{0}\\big)/\\big(Z_{\\mathsf{i n}}+Z_{0}\\big)\\big|\n$$  \n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathsf{i n}}\\!=\\!Z_{0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{r}}{\\varepsilon_{r}}}}\\mathsf{t a n h}\\!\\left(j{\\frac{2\\pi t f{\\sqrt{\\mu_{r}\\varepsilon_{r}}}}{c}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere  $Z_{\\mathsf{i n}}$   and   $Z_{0}=377~\\Omega$   denote the material impedance and vacuum  impedance, respectively;   $t,~c$  , and  $f$  represent the absorber thickness,  velocity of light, and measured frequency, respectively. When the RL  is below   $^{-10}$    dB,   $90\\%$   microwave attenuation was expected. Here, the  frequency range with RL below  − 10 dB was considered as the effective  absorbing bandwidth   $(f_{\\mathsf{E}},$  \n\nDensity Functional Theory Calculations : The density functional theory  (DFT) computations were performed using the Cambridge Sequential  Total Energy Package. In this study, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)  function's generalized gradient approximation was employed. With a  kinetic energy cutoff of   $500~\\mathrm{eV},$   the planewave basis was used to expand  the electron wave function. The mesh of   $K$   points was set at   $\\rceil\\times\\rceil\\times\\rceil$  .  To prevent picture interactions, vacuum layers of   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$   were used to  separate the periodic images. The model of spinel/perovskite HE oxides  was sliced from the (110) and (111) planes for the perovskite and spinel  phases, respectively, with different thickness. The model of rock salt/ spinel HE oxides was sliced from the (220) plane for the rock salt and  spinel phases with varied thickness, respectively. Moreover, oxygen  vacancies were generated on the interface for better description of the  samples. During geometry optimization, all atoms were allowed to relax.  The energy convergence criterion was   $10{-}5~{\\mathrm{eV}}$   and the final forces were   ${<\\!0.01\\!\\mathrm{~}\\!\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\bar{\\mathsf{A}}^{\\cdot1}}$   at each atom.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors appreciate the financial supports from the National Natural  Science Foundation of China (52231007, 51725101, 11727807, 61790581,  22088101, 52271167), the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (973  Project Nos. 2018 Y FA 0209100 and 2021 Y FA 1200600), the Shanghai Excellent  Academic/Technological Leaders Program (19 XD 1400400), the Foundation  for University Youth Key Teachers of Henan Province (2020 GG JS 170), the  Science Foundation for The Excellent Youth Scholars of Henan Province  (212300410089), the Support Program for Scientific and Technological  Innovation Talents of Higher Education in Henan Province (21 HAST IT 004),  and and Key Research Project of Zhejiang Lab (No. 2021 PE 0 AC 02).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Data Availability Statement  \n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the  corresponding author upon reasonable request.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ndefects, dual-phases, high-entropy oxides, inter facial polarizations,  microwave absorption s  \n\nReceived: August 27, 2022 Revised: September 28, 2022 Published online: October 27, 2022  \n\nH. Bi, C. Liang, K. Yuan, W. She, Y. Yang, R. Che,  Adv.
