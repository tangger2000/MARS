CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals coated with zirconium oxide, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>Synthesis method<|>Modified method used to obtain CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsBr<|>Reagent<|>Cesium bromide, a source of cesium ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbBr2<|>Reagent<|>Lead bromide, a source of lead ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve CsBr and PbBr2, abbreviated as DMF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OAm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Intermediate product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals formed before ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>Precursor<|>Zirconium butoxide, precursor for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZrO2<|>Coating material<|>Zirconium oxide, used to coat CsPbBr3 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Room temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the synthesis was carried out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.4 mmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of PbBr2 and CsBr used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of DMF used to dissolve PbBr2 and CsBr)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.2 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OAm used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.6 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OA used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1500 rpm<|>Reaction condition<|>Speed of vigorous stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10s<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>60 µmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 used for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8500 rpm<|>Purification condition<|>Speed of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 min<|>Purification condition<|>Duration of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The modified super saturated recrystallization method is used to synthesize CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsBr<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>CsBr is a source of cesium ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbBr2<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>PbBr2 is a source of lead ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CsBr<|>DMF is used to dissolve CsBr<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbBr2<|>DMF is used to dissolve PbBr2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OA acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OAm acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Toluene acts as an antisolvent to induce the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>ZrO2<|>Zr(OC4H9)4 is the precursor for ZrO2 coating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZrO2<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>ZrO2 forms a coating on CsPbBr3 NCs to create CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Room temperature<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs is carried out at room temperature<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm is used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Centrifugation at 8500 rpm is used to purify CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: \\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}$   sized QR code with individual components clearly printed as small as   $1\\times1$   mm with red, green,  and blue UCNPs (Figure 5c).  \n\nScreen printing is a well-established method to transfer UCNP  ink onto a substrate via a stencilled mesh. The careful consideration in choosing dispersive medium allows the anticounterfeiting marks to be printed on substrates such as paper and  polyethylene terephthalate (Figure 5d).  Photolithography  techniques use light to transfer a pattern onto a substrate to  micro fabricate UCNPs into anti counterfeiting applications  (Figure 5e). By employing the photolithography method, the  UCNPs have been printed as anti counterfeiting marks with line  widths as narrow as   $50~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   as demonstrated by Kim et al. Electrical nano imprint lithography (e-NIL) also known as nano xerography allows through electrostatic trapping the micro/ nano patterning of UCNPs. Sangeetha et  al. used an AFM tip  to charge a pattern across a PMMA thin film which when subsequently exposed to a colloidal solution containing UCNPs  caused the direct assembly of the nano crystals to occur on the  charged pattern. This type of nano xerography allowed the formation of a  $40\\times40\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   up conversion QR code with monolayers  of thickness controlled from 25 to   $350~\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 5f).  The  other e-NIL process applied for UCNPs by Diaz et al. involved a  process of heating and cooling a mold applied to a PMMA thin  film in the presence of an electrical field. This method allowed  for the large-scale fabrication of   $50~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$   QR codes composed of  28 nm UCNPs with more than 300,000 QR codes produced on  a single 4 in. silicon wafer. These QR codes could then be easily  transferred to a transparent flexible host film for direct anticounterfeiting application.  \n\n# 6. Future: The Road toward Technology  Implementation  \n\nThe present overt anti counterfeiting technology allows for rapid  and non-cost verification. The emission colors and intensities  can be directly visualized on office paper,  polyethylene  terephthalate film,  and banknotes.  Due to the limitation of  human beings to identify complex and sophisticated color and  intensity patterns with their naked eyes, specialized training is  needed for overt technology, making it challenging for ordinary  people to recognize counterfeit items. Covert technology goes  beyond the capability of human vision by relying on external  equipment to assist information decoding. This enables highsecurity-level anti counterfeiting marks to be developed. Highsecurity-level anti counterfeiting technologies will meet the  growing markets in confirming the authenticity of valuable  products, from pharmaceutical drugs to medical courier supplies and banknotes. By using luminescent nanoparticles with  covert information that can be encoded in multiple orthogonal  dimensions or is responsive to external stimuli, genuine goods  or personal IDs would become resistant to abuse and fraud,  helping to prevent identity theft.  \n\nUp conversion nanoparticles are promising for future covert  anti counterfeiting taggants because of their unique and abundant optical properties that can be tailored with various design  strategies. However, to reach the mass market, general safety  consideration and regulations on usage must be well considered,  particularly, in the specific applications of up conversion nanoparticle-based taggants for authenticating food and medicine. A  recent study showed that about   $355~\\mathrm{{ng}}$   of up conversion nanoparticles are sufficient for a composite 3D anti counterfeiting QR  code on a drug capsule.  Based on an estimation of the routine  uptake of 3 capsules per day, a total of   $0.39~\\mathrm{mg}$   of the UCNPs  is dosed to the human body per annum, which is still within  the safe dose range of   $10{-}15~\\mathrm{mg}~\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$   (on mice).  Despite this,  the toxicity of the lanthanide dopant library and the potential  interaction of UCNPs with the encrypted products must be fully  understood before a safety regulation can be established.  \n\nTo date, a variety of complex covert technologies are available. They include security inks, hidden printed messages,  digital watermarks, barcodes, and optically stored marks.  Only machines are able to retrieve the encrypted information  quantitatively. While machine-readable technologies bear the  benefits of integrating authentication and trace ability into one  single label, not a single current device is capable of decoding  the multiple optical dimensions of new materials, making their  implementation questionable. A future trend will be to equip  smartphones with miniaturized op to electronics devices. This  technical direction takes into account the widespread use of  smartphones, their portability and internet accessibility for realtime trace, track and verification of genuine goods.  In this  regard, a growing number of proof-of-concept demonstrations  have already involved the use of a smartphone devices to read  out printed QR codes.  \n\nThe availability of miniaturized laser diodes, electronic shutters, optical filters, and micro electronic heaters at low cost  may provide the required excitation conditions  and external  stimuli, such as temperature,  as well as lifetime image  detectors ( Figure    6 a) for most of the security inks currently  being developed in the labs. However, the seamless integration of the existing different bulky components into a compact  smartphone device is challenging. Ongoing developments of  miniaturized optics such as lens-free imaging, micro-optics  technologies, and meta surface photonic devices provide promising solutions along this direction.  \n\nMany existing decoding setups are based on conventional  microscopic imaging of encoded patterns. However, conventional lens-based microscopy is bulky and expensive. In this  respect, lens-free imaging has evolved as a modality competitive with traditional lens-based microscopy (Figure 6b). By computing the diffraction patterns taken by a digital image sensor  array, the image of an object can be reliably reconstructed with  a resolution that is comparable to that taken by a high magnification microscope objective. This technology is highly compatible with smartphone integration, but it is worth noting that  more effort needs to be devoted to boosting the computational  power of mobile phone devices.  \n\nMicro-optics are optical systems with dimensions between  a few micrometers to a millimeter. As a branch application of  micro-optics, op to fluid ics has witnessed a surge of microsized  optics being integrated with fluidic cartridges for smartphones  (Figure  6c). Though the field has been primarily focused on  biological assays, many technical integration attempts made  here could be shared with smartphone-based anti counterfeiting  technologies. As an example, compact temperature controllers  have been developed for on-chip polymerase chain reactions. It  is anticipated that they may find use in the decryption of security inks requiring on-chip temperature controls. Using microfluidic synthesis methods, microbeads of well-controlled size  can be fabricated and assembled into super-lens arrays. The  arrays have been used to efficiently converge light for exciting  up conversion nanoparticles (Figure 6d). Such microlens arrays  potentially can be integrated with a smartphone allowing new  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/77e35aba2101666d6ad161b5354051a434d916fcde5e6ae4116aa9ca63f5bd0f-1727124565.jpg)  \nFigure 6.   Enabling technologies and devices suitable for smartphone-based anti counterfeiting decryption. a) Exemplar miniaturized components that  can be integrated to enable a smartphone with the new decoding capacity. b) Lens-less imaging based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor  (CMOS) or charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors.
