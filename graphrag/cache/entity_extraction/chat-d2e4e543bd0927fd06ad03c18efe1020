The precursor was prepared by mixing CsBr (0.4 mmol), PbBr2 (0.4 mmol), oleylamine (OLA, 0.5 mL), and oleic acid (OA, 1 mL) in DMF (10 mL) (Figure S1a).

When investigating the influence of water added to the \"bad solvent\", 1 mL of the dry precursor was injected into a mixture of toluene and water (10 mL + x μL, 0≤x≤60) (Figure S1c).

CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals coated with zirconium oxide, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>Synthesis method<|>Modified method used to obtain CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsBr<|>Reagent<|>Cesium bromide, a source of cesium ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbBr2<|>Reagent<|>Lead bromide, a source of lead ions for the nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve CsBr and PbBr2, abbreviated as DMF)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand, abbreviated as OAm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of nanocrystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Intermediate product<|>Cesium lead bromide nanocrystals formed before ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>Precursor<|>Zirconium butoxide, precursor for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZrO2<|>Coating material<|>Zirconium oxide, used to coat CsPbBr3 NCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Room temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the synthesis was carried out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.4 mmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of PbBr2 and CsBr used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of DMF used to dissolve PbBr2 and CsBr)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.2 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OAm used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.6 mL<|>Dosage<|>Volume of OA used in the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1500 rpm<|>Reaction condition<|>Speed of vigorous stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10s<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of stirring during synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>60 µmol<|>Dosage<|>Amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 used for ZrO2 coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8500 rpm<|>Purification condition<|>Speed of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5 min<|>Purification condition<|>Duration of centrifugation to obtain precipitates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Super saturated recrystallization method<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The modified super saturated recrystallization method is used to synthesize CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsBr<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>CsBr is a source of cesium ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbBr2<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>PbBr2 is a source of lead ions for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CsBr<|>DMF is used to dissolve CsBr<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbBr2<|>DMF is used to dissolve PbBr2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OA acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>OAm acts as a surface ligand for CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Toluene acts as an antisolvent to induce the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zr(OC4H9)4<|>ZrO2<|>Zr(OC4H9)4 is the precursor for ZrO2 coating<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZrO2<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>ZrO2 forms a coating on CsPbBr3 NCs to create CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Room temperature<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>The synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs is carried out at room temperature<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3 NCs<|>Vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm is used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8500 rpm<|>CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>Centrifugation at 8500 rpm is used to purify CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: 1]\t J.  Song, C.  Wei, Z.-F.  Huang, C.  Liu, L.  Zeng, X.  Wang, Z.
