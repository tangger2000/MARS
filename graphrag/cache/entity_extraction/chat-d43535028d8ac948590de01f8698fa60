CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is widely known that the  surface quenching leads to the shorter lifetimes.  Herein, the  increased PL lifetimes could be the result of fewer surface traps.  On the one hand, the crystal size increased. As mentioned  above, the redshift between   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composites and corresponding NCs is associated with spontaneous growth in the  ambient air. A larger crystal size means less surface defect for  each single nano crystal. On the other hand, in comparison with  the embedding PQDs into rigid silica matrices,  silanol  groups are not effectively passivated on the surfaces of NCs and  thus cannot prevent non radiative recombination through localized states, while the compact and flexible PS polymer chains  can passivate the surfaces effectively.  \n\nAs mentioned above, anion exchange reacted when different  kinds of lead halide per ovsk ites mixed. This phenomenon takes  place in liquid and even solid phase, which impedes their applications in LED devices and liquid crystal display (LCD) backlights. As shown in Figure S7a (Supporting Information), blue  and green luminescence shift to cyan within several seconds in  toluene solution. While mixing the red and green PQD powders  (Figure S7b, Supporting Information), their PL spectra become  broader first, and then turned to be yellow sharp emission in  the end after rapid anion-exchange process. As demonstrated  in  Figure   3 a, packing PQDs into cross linked PS spheres is an  effective way to prevent the ion-exchange reaction. There is no  spectral variation or shifts even after   $24\\textrm{h}$   mixing of blue and  green emitting   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{PS}$   powders. Furthermore, the fluorescence microscopy can be used to visualize the isolated blue and  green composites (inset of Figure 3a). The mixed composite  microspheres still emit strong blue and green luminescence,  respectively, after one-week storage. As previously described,  ion-exchange reaction taken place in solid state reactions is  much slower than in solution. Therefore,   $\\mathrm{PODs}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composites were soaked in halide salts hexane solution for further test.   $20~\\mathrm{mg}$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PS}$   composite powders were dispersed in   $2~\\mathrm{mL}$   of hexane, and different quantities of hexylamine chloride precursor solution (dispersed in   $5\\ \\mathrm{mL}$   hexane, preparation details are described in the Supporting Information) were  swiftly injected. To ensure the completion of ion-exchange  reaction, each mixture was under vigorously stirred for   $10\\;\\mathrm{{min}}$  .  \n\nThen, the PL spectra were obtained as shown in Figure 3b.  Obviously, both PL peak position and FWHM present little difference (within   $2\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  ) in comparison with pristine composites.  All the results indicate that this approach is relatively efficient to  protect PQDs against anion exchange and offers the possibility  for the applications of white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and  LCD backlights by simple mixing.  \n\nA perovskite WLED device was fabricated by mixing the green   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PS}$   and red   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Br}_{0.4}\\mathrm{I}_{0.6})_{3}$   on a blue emitting InGaN  chip. The spectrum of the resulting device is shown in  Figure   4 ,  in which three individual emission peaks were observed, indicating that the ion-exchange reaction of per ovsk ites was successfully averted. Both of the positions of the electroluminescence  (EL) maximum and FWHM for the green   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PS}$   and  red   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Br}_{0.4}\\mathrm{I}_{0.6})_{3}$   are in good correlation with the solid state  PL spectra of the respective powders. The PL peak positions are  442, 524, and   $614\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   for the primary colors, and 21, 22, and   $44\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   for FWHM, respectively.
