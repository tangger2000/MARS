CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Bi et  al. reported that  poly(methyl meth a cry late) (PMMA) could  template perovskite nucleation and crystal  growth.  Yang et  al. showed that the  introduction of additional iodide ions into  the organic cation solution decreased the  concentration of deep-level defects, which  in return resulted in a certified record  PCE of   $22.1\\%$   for OIHP devices.  To  slow down the perovskite crystallization,  and improve grain size and crystal lin it y,  the solvent additives such as dimethyl sul­ foxide (DMSO),  N -methyl-2-pyr ro li done  (NMP), and 1,8-d iio do octane (DIO) were  added into the precursor solution to form  \n\nUniform and high-electronic-quality perovskite thin films are essential  for high-performance perovskite devices. Here, it is shown that the  3-(dec yl dimethyl ammon io)-propane-sulfonate inner salt (DPSI), which is a  sulfonic zwitterion, plays dual roles in tuning the crystallization behavior and  pas siva ting the defects of per ovsk ites. The synergistic effect of crystallization  control and defect pass iv ation remarkably suppresses pinhole formation,  reduces the charge trap density, and lengthens the carrier recombination  lifetime, and thereafter boosts the small-area   $(0.08\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{2})$   planar perovskite  device efficiency to  $21.1\\%$   and enables a high efficiency of   $\\mathbf{18.3\\%}$   for bladecoating large-area   $(1\\ {\\mathsf{c m}}^{2})$   devices. The device also shows good light stability,  which remains at  $\\mathbf{88\\%}$   of the initial efficiency under continuous unfiltered  AM 1.5G light illumination for  $\\mathbf{480\\,h}$  . These findings provide an avenue for  simultaneous crystallization control and defect pass iv ation to further improve  the performance of perovskite devices.  \n\nOrganic–inorganic  halide  per ovsk ites  (OIHPs)  exhibit  impressive op to electronic properties, including large absorption  coefficient, long carrier recombination lifetime, long carrier dif­ fusion length, and are emerging as promising candidates for the  low-cost and high-performance photovoltaics (PVs) and other  op to electronic applications.  Benefiting from these favorable  attributes, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of pero­ vskite PV has been rapidly improved from   $3.8\\%$   to a certified  value of   $23.3\\%^{[10]}$   over the past several years.  Meanwhile,  an entire range of techniques used to produce efficient perovs­ kite solar cells has been developed. The techniques that enable  rapid PCE advances are based not only on the optimization of  \n\nthe complexes with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , and these complexes can be slowly  converted into perovskite by an intramolecular exchanging  process.  However, these solvent additives could be evapo­ rated during the high-temperature annealing process and thus  play no defect pass iv ation functions after the OIHP films dry.  It has been shown that the surfaces and grain boundaries of  solution-processed OIHP films can be a reservoir of trap states  or deep defect states which dominate the non radiative charge  recombination and pull down the open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$   of  perovskite devices, and also initiate the perovskite film degra­ dation.  Therefore, reducing the number of defects at film  surfaces and grain boundaries is necessary to enhance both  efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.  It is still  challenging to realize the synergistic effect of the morphology  controlling and trap states pass iv ation for further enhancement  of the PCE and stability of OIHP devices.  \n\nIn this study, we introduce the sulfonic zwitterion to simul­ taneously control the perovskite crystallization and passi­ vate defect states of OIHP thin films, which enhances the  small-area   $(0.08\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   and large-area   $(1\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   planar perovskite  device efficiency to   $21.1\\%$   and   $18.3\\%$  , respectively. The results  highlight the synergetic effect of controlling crystallization and  trap pass iv ation for improving perovskite devices.  \n\nIt is clear that the ligands containing sulfonic group, such  as DMSO, can form complex with lead ions in the perovskite  precursor, which significantly slows down the perovskite  crystallization and benefits for the high-quality film fabrica­ tion.   The  3-(dec yl dimethyl ammon io)-propane-sulfonate  inner salt (DPSI) is a sulfonic zwitterion which contains a  positively charged quaternary ammonium group, a negatively  charged sulfonic group, and a long alkyl chain. It has been  reported that a mph i phil ic sur fact ants could increase the adhe­ sion of the perovskite ink to the substrate, and enable blading  of high-efficiency perovskite modules.  Moreover, our  previous study showed that the z witter ionic molecules could  efficiently passivate the defects of per ovsk ites, but this surface  treatment strategy is lack of the function of the morphology  tailoring.  Thus, the DPSI molecule, a sulfonic zwitterion, is  potentially capable of assembling the function of crystallization  tuning because of the surfactant nature and the lead coordina­ tion by the sulfonic group, together with the function of the  defect pass iv ation due to its z witter ionic structure.  \n\nTo study the influence on the perovskite crystallization, we  introduced a small amount of DPSI molecules   $(0.05\\ \\mathrm{wt\\%})$   into  the methyl ammonium (MA) lead iodide   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   precursor  solution and fabricated the perovskite thin film by a one-step  spin-coating method. The formation of coordination bond  between DPSI and lead ions of the perovskite can be proved  by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy study.  As shown in Figure  S1 (Supporting Information), the peak  appeared at   $1029\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   is attribute to the   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{S=O}}$   stretch from the  sulfonic group of DPSI. This peak shifted to   $1010\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , which  attributed to the coordination with the perovskite where the   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{S=O}}$   may donate their lone unpaired electron to the empty  orbitals of   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  , which is in consistent with the strong interac­ tion between the sulfonic group of the DMSO molecule and the  lead ion in the perovskite precursor. It is widely proposed that  applying an anti solvent during spin coating of precursor films  causes rapid supersaturation of solution and thus quick nuclea­ tion.  During the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   film processing, the drying of  the precursor solution first yields a yellow inter medium phase  containing residual solvent (such as dime thy form amide (DMF)  or DMSO). The subsequent uncontrolled fast-drying and rapidcrystallization process under the thermal annealing could cause  morphological defects, such as pinholes, and a broad grain size  distribution.  \n\nAs illustrated in  Figure   1 a, we propose that the DPSI mole­ cules could attach on the surfaces of perovskite nucleus because  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/7d53c87119b73b2518c0f452b1becdf0e804bda57641f3b517bf9c0ca36a5fb5-1723833512.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Schematic illustration of DPSI mediated perovskite growth and defect pass iv ation. a\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
