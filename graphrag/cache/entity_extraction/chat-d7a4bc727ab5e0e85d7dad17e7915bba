CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

In the case of  G3 device, although the FF can be further increased to 0.67,  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  is decreased to   $19.3\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , leading to a slightly lower PCE.  The decreased   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   can be ascribed to the fact that more layers  of graphene imply a lower transmittance.  Therefore, the  optimum PCE of the as-fabricated flexible PSCs is a compromise  between the conductivity and the transmittance of the graphene  electrode. Integrating the incident photon to current efficiency \n\n (IPCE) spectra, Figure 2b, yielded photo current densities of 19.9, \n\n 19.2, and  $18.4\\mathrm{\\:mA\\:cm}^{-2}$   for the flexible PSCs fabricated with G1,  G2, and G3 electrodes, respectively, which were consistent (less  than  $6\\%$   deviation) with the measured  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   from the scanned  $J{-}V$  curves. Impedance spectroscopy was used to clarify the charge  recombination behaviors. Only one semicircle arc was observed  in the Nyquist plots in dark (Figure S5, Supporting Information),  which could be attributed to the overall recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}}).^{[40,41]}$   It is found that the  $R_{s}$   (series resistance) among these  three devices is in the order of   $R_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\mathrm{G}3)\\mathrm{\\textless\\!R_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\mathrm{G}2)\\textless\\!R_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\mathrm{G}1)}$  , and the   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   values for the G2- and G3-based solar cells were significantly  higher than that of G1-based device, indicating a lower recombination rate in the G2- and G3-based devices.  \n\nFigure   3 a presents the   $J{-}V$   curves of G2-based solar cells  fabricated with or without additional spiro-OMeTAD hole  transport conductor. The extracted photovoltaic parameters  are summarized in Table S3 (Supporting Information). The  G2-based flexible PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD show negligible   $J{-}V$   hysteresis, with the PCEs of   $11.9\\%$   and   $11.1\\%$   measured  under reverse and forward scans, respectively. Encouragingly,  the hole-conductor-free flexible PSC also achieved promising  PCEs of   $8.4\\%$   and   $6.4\\%$   measured under reverse and forward  scans, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is also  the first demonstration on the hole-conductor-free carbon back  electrode-based flexible PSCs. The photo current densities of  the flexible PSCs near their maximum power points were stabilized to 17.4 and   $13.5\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (Figure 3b), yielding stabilized  PCEs of   $11.4\\%$   and   $7.7\\%$   for the flexible devices with or without  spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Moreover, the incorporation of  the spiro-OMeTAD hole conductor also increased the average  efficiency of the flexible PSCs (  $'10.2\\,\\pm\\,1.2\\%$   vs   $7.1\\;\\pm\\;1.3\\%,$  ,  Figure S6, Supporting Information). To elucidate the effect of  spiro-OMeTAD on the device performance, the charge-carrier  dynamics in pristine and CSCNT-containing perovskite films  were investigated using a steady-state PL measurement. For  comparison, the sample of pristine perovskite interfaced with  spiro-OMeTAD was also examined. The steady-state PL result  is shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). The pristine  perovskite film shows an intense PL emission peak at around   $770\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . In the presence of a charge-extraction layer (CSCNTs,  spiro-OMeTAD, or CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD), the PL of the  pristine perovskite film was strongly quenched, indicating a  rapid extraction of charges across the interfaces after photon  excitation. TRPL spectroscopy was further used to evaluate the  charge-carrier dynamics quantitatively, as shown in Figure 3c.  The pristine perovskite film exhibited a long charge-carrier lifetime of   $\\tau_{10}=185$   ns (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information,   $\\tau_{10}$   is the time at which the initial PL intensity decreases by a  factor of   $10^{[42,43]}$  ). In comparison, the charge-carrier lifetime  \n\nof perovskite films decreased obviously when interfaced with  CSCNT (  $\\tau_{10}=46$   ns), and spiro-OMeTAD (  $\\tau_{10}=17$   ns). Moreover, the charge transfer from the perovskite to the CSCNT– spiro-OMeTAD (  $\\tau_{10}\\,=\\,6$   ns) was more rapid than that from  perovskite to that of CSCNT or spiro-OMeTAD, indicating that  the CSCNT and spiro-OMeTAD can synergistic ally facilitate the  charge extraction and transportation. The sufficient hole extraction and transportation could considerably hinder the negative  ionic charge accumulation at the   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}/$  charge contact interfaces, which ultimately resulted in higher PCEs and  negligible   $J{-}V$  hysteresis in the CSCNT–spiro-OMeTAD-based  flexible PSCs.  In addition, it is worth noting that in this  study all-carbon-electrode-based flexible PSCs (with or without  spiro-OMeTAD) also demonstrated higher PCEs compared with  other kinds of all-carbon-electrode-based solar cells (Figure 3d),  including all-carbon-solar cells   $(\\approx\\!5.7\\:\\times\\:10^{-3}\\%)$  ,  all-carbonfiber-electrode-based dye-sensitized solar cells   $(<\\!2\\%)$  ,  and  all graphene-electrode-based organic solar cells   $(3.4\\%)$  .  \n\nThe mechanical flexibility of all-carbon-electrode-based  flexible PSCs was evaluated by bending at different bending  curvature and bending cycles. First, the bending test was  performed with different curvature radii, from 8 to   $2.2~\\mathrm{mm}$    under 200 bending cycles ( Figure   4 a). For comparison, reference ITO-based flexible PSCs with the standard structure  of   $\\mathrm{PEN/ITO/TiO_{2}/P C B M/C H_{3}N H_{3}P b I_{3}/}$  /spiro-OMeTAD/Au  (ITO/Au) were also fabricated. The PCE of carbon-based  flexible PSCs had almost no decrease even after bending  with   $4~\\mathrm{mm}$   curvature and then slightly decreased to   $85\\%$   of  the original\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
