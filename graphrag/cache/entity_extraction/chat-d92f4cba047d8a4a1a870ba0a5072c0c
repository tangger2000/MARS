CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

We also used timeof-flight (ToF) technique to confirm the high electron mobility  of   $241\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  , as shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). Additionally, from the linear ohmic region at low voltages,  we also obtained the conductivity of the FAMACs SC to be   $\\sigma=2.2\\times10^{-8}~(\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm})^{-}$  . Finally, by combining the long carrier  lifetime with the higher measured mobility, we obtained the  best-case carrier diffusion length   $L_{\\mathrm{D}}=(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\mu\\tau/\\mathrm{e})^{1/2}=68.9~\\upmu\\mathrm{m},$  ,  where  $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$   is Boltzmann’s constant and   $T$   the temperature.  \n\nIn addition to the semiconductor properties, hardness of  the SCs is also a key figure of merit in practical applications.  We then performed the nano indentation measurement on  the FAMACs SCs. To compare the hardness of different SCs,   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$  , and FAMACs SCs  were grown and their photographs are shown in Figure   $^{2\\mathrm{d-h}}$  ,  all of them were used for nano indentation measurements. In  Figure 2i, a typical triangular pyramid indentation was formed  after the nano indentation measurement, indicating that irreversible plastic deformation happened under the Berkovich tip.  In this work, we measured the load-force-dependent indentation  depth curves on the (100) facet of each SC, as the plots shown  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/39898877852c7b04c4e511207b73a1f3527fafdf801bd137a743c868af3edf3b-1723836110.jpg)  \nFigure   3.   Configuration and electrical properties of FAMACs SC detectors. a,b) Schematic diagrams of two FAMACs SC X-ray detector structures:  a) symmetric electrode and b) asymmetric electrode. c) Absorbance of FAMACs SC to   $40~\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{keV}}$   X-ray photons versus thickness. d,e) Energy level and  corresponding band diagram of asymmetric and symmetric structure. f,g) Band energy diagram and charge injection under bias in the asymmetric  and symmetric structure device. h,i) Dark current density as a function of applied voltage of the asymmetric and symmetric structured X-ray detector.  \n\nin Figure  2j. All curves obtained from the SCs are smooth,  the absence of “pop-in” events in the curves indicates that the  deformations are homogeneous during the indentation.  It  shows that under the same load force, the indentation depth is  different on various SCs. Among the  $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$     $(\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Cl})$  , Br, and I)  SCs, the indentation depth on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   SC is the shallowest,  demonstrating the maximum hardness. The indentation hardness of the SCs is presented in Figure 2k, we can find that the  hardness is in the order of  $\\mathrm{MAPbCl}_{3}<\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3}<\\mathrm{MAPbCl}_{3}$   SC,  in agreement with the trend reported in the literature.  Different hardness of these three crystals reflects the differences  in the   $\\mathrm{Pb-X}$   bond strengths, and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   SC shows a higher  hardness may because of the lower symmetry in the crystal  structure.  Rather interestingly, the hardness of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   SC  is much smaller than the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   SC. However, when the triple  cations and mixed halides are all incorporated into the   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$  SC, the hardness of the FAMACs SC significantly exceeds that  of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   SC. This result demonstrated that the mechanical  property of the   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$   SC enhanced after reducing the lattice  stress by incorporating smaller ions.  \n\nBased on the discussion above, we find that the FAMACs  SCs show superior charge mobility, longer carrier lifetime and  diffusion length, ultralow trap density and higher hardness.  It is expected that the FAMACs SCs is an ideal material for  solid-state op to electronic devices. To validate this hypothesis,  we designed and fabricated vertical structure X-ray detectors  on the FAMACs SC. As shown in  Figure   3 a,b two different  structures were constructed, a symmetric electrode structure of  Au/FAMACs SC/Au and an asymmetric electrode structure of   $\\mathrm{{Nu}/\\mathrm{{BCP}}/\\mathrm{{C}}_{60}}/$  FAMACs SC/SpiroTTB/Au. To determinate a suitable thickness of the FAMACs SC for efficient X-ray absorption  and carrier extraction, the absorbance efficiency of FAMACs  SC with different thickness to   $40\\ \\mathrm{keV}$   X-ray photons was calculated in Figure  3c. It is shown that the X-ray absorbance  efficiency is about   $97.1\\%$  .1% for a   $0.5~\\mathrm{mm}$   thick FAMACs SC and  about   $99.9\\%$   for a   $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$   thick FAMACs SC. However, a thicker  (1 mm) FAMACs SC is better to obtain lower dark current even  under high bias and can further minimize the disturbance  from ambient light. Therefore, we controlled the thickness of  FAMACs SC to  $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$   for detector fabrication. The energy level  of symmetric and asymmetric electrode structure is shown  in Figure 3d,e. In the symmetric structured detector, Au electrodes   $(50\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) were deposited directly on the opposite sides  of a single crystal   $(1~\\mathrm{mm})$  ) by vacuum evaporation. According  to the CBM at   $-5.57~\\mathrm{eV}$   and VBM at   $-4.04~\\mathrm{eV}$   from absorbance and PYSA measurement, the   ${\\bf C}_{60}$   with a work function of   $-4.50\\,\\mathrm{~eV}$   was selected as the electron transport layer and the  SpiroTTB   $(-5.30\\,\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   was selected as the hole transport layer.  Therefore, for the asymmetric structure, before evaporating  the Au electrodes, a BCP   $(5\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) and a  ${\\sf C}_{60}$   (  $.20~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) layer were  evaporated on one side, and a SpiroTTB layer was evaporated  on another side. The corresponding band diagram of these two  structures is depicted in Figure   $\\mathrm{{3f,g}}$  .  \n\nIt should be noted that due to the energy barrier in the  asymmetric electrode configuration, the hole injection from  the anode or electron from the cathode is inhibited. Therefore, asymmetric-type FAMACs SC X-ray detector shows an  extremely low dark current density of   $-1.44~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   even  under   $-75~\\mathrm{V}$   high reverse bias (Figure 3h). Under forward bias   $(75\\,\\mathrm{\\:V})$  , the dark current density is increased about 2 orders  of magnitude higher to   $133.33\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{A\\cm}^{-2}$  . Even under a higher  negative bias of   $-150\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , the dark current density of the asymmetric device is still limited at   $-2.03\\ \\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . In contrast, the  dark current density measured from the symmetrical detector  is   $-36.06~\\upmu\\mathrm{A~cm}^{-2}$   under a   $-150\\mathrm{~V~}$   bias (Figure 3i). The statistical result in Table S3 (Supporting Information) shows that  the dark current density measured in symmetric detectors is  about 15 times higher than that of asymmetric detectors under  the same bias of  $-150\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
