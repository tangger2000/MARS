OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

For comparison, all five single-metal perovskite oxides,  including   $\\mathrm{LaCrO}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathrm{LaMlnO}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathrm{LaFeO}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathrm{LaCOO}_{3}$  , and  $\\mathrm{LaNSiO}_{3}$  , were  also used as electro catalysts. The electrochemical test results of  single-metal perovskite oxides are shown in Figure S10, Supporting Information. It can be seen that   $\\mathrm{LaCOO}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{LaNSiO}_{3}$    have a higher catalytic activity with the lowest over potential of  380 at current density of   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (  $.\\eta_{10}=380~\\mathrm{mV})$  ), followed  by  $\\mathrm{LaCrdO}_{3}$   (  $.\\eta_{10}=420\\;\\mathrm{mV})$  ),   $\\mathrm{LaFeO}_{3}$   (  $(\\eta_{10}=437~\\mathrm{mV})$  ), and   $\\mathrm{LaMlnO}_{3}$    with the worst performance of   $\\eta_{10}=460\\ \\mathrm{mV}\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
