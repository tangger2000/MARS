CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The electron mobility of ETL/PVK increases from   $4.09\\times10^{-4}$   to   $4.60\\,\\times\\,10^{-4}\\,\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  after 3AAH treatment,  which should be ascribed to the refined   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$   crystal lization with enlarged grain size and improved phase purity. The  increment in electron mobility ensures a more efficient charge  extraction from PVK to ETL, which is beneficial to improve the  photovoltaic performance of the device. In addition, it is further demonstrated that the pre-buried 3AAH additive reduces  the trap state density of PVK from   $1.43\\times10^{16}$   to  $1.10\\times10^{16}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$    according to the equation   $N_{t}=\\frac{2\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}{e L^{2}}$  . It could be assigned to  the passivated trap states by 2D phases in the PVK film, which  is consistent with our previous analysis.  \n\nTo evaluate the charge recombination kinetics at the  ETL/PVK interface, the Nyquist plots of the devices are studied  in Figure   $5\\mathrm{k},$  , the results are fitted according to the equivalent  circuit diagram. It is observed that the   $3\\mathrm{AAH}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -based  device exhibits higher   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$     $(853.07\\ \\Omega)$   than the control device   $(444.75\\ \\ \\Omega)$  , indicating that the charge recombination at the  ETL/ PVK interface is suppressed. Figure  5l shows the  Mott–Schottky characteristics for PSCs. According to Equation:   $C^{-2}=2(V_{b i}-V)/(A^{2}q\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}N_{d})$  , where  $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   is built-in potential,  $N_{\\mathrm{d}}$   is  charge density.  The charge density   $(N_{\\mathrm{d}})$   can be extracted to be   $1.19\\!\\times\\!10^{16}$   and  $4.82\\!\\times\\!10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   for pristine  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   and 3AAH $\\mathrm{{Sno}_{2}}$    based PSCs, respectively. The decrease of   $\\mathrm{N_{d}}$   at the ETL/PVK  interface indicates reduced charge accumulation, which implies  an improved charge extraction efficiency at the interface. A  higher   $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$   indicates a stronger electric field between the ETL  and PVK layers, implying the suppressed charge carrier recombination and facilitated carrier transfer. This is consistent with  the SCLC analysis.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn conclusion, to improve the quality of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and its inter facial  characteristics of the ETL/PVK interface, the 3AAH additive  is pre-buried into the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL. The bottom-up modification  strategy assists the growth of PVK grains and effectively reduces  the ETL/PVK inter facial defects and bulk defects. In addition,  the 3AAH treatment transforms the residual tensile stress into  micro-compressive stress, which is beneficial to improve the stability of PVK film. As a result, the 3AAH-based f-PSCs achieve  an excellent PCE of   $23.36\\%$  , which is one of the highest PCEs  of f-PSCs reported to date. The 2D phases also affords improved  bend ability to the PVK film, therefore, the devices maintain   $84\\%$    of the initial PCE after 4000 bending cycles (  $\\mathtt{R}=5$   mm). In addition, the f-PSCs shows outstanding stability by maintaining   $92\\%$    of the initial PCE after 30 days aging in ambient environment.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was financially supported by the National Science Fund for  Distinguished Young Scholars (21925506), National Natural Science  Foundation of China (U21A20331, 81903743, 22005322 and 22279151).  \n\n# Conflict of Interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Data Availability Statement  \n\nResearch data are not shared.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\nflexible perovskite solar cells, pre-buried addictive, residual stress,   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  \n\nReceived: December 19, 2022 Revised: March 14, 2023 Published online: April 4, 2023  \n\n[1]\t H.  Min, D.
