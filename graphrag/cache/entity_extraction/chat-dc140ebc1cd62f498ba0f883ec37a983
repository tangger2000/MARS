CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

We tentatively attributed this phenomenon to the generated BiOBr that passivated the surface defects. Eventually,   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs exhibited an only   $10\\%$   relative reduction in PL  intensity after  $8\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$   storage.  \n\nTo verify our water-induced BiOBr pass iv ation hypothesis, a   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystal was soaked into DI water for a whole  day. A white husk was generated on the surface of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$  single crystal. The water-soaked   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystal was  dried at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in the glove box. The thin layer at the surface  was peeled off from the   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystal due to the  different coefficient of thermal expansion. Images of pristine  and water-soaked   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystals, as well as the husk  removed from the surface, are shown in Figure S11 (Supporting  Information). The husk of this soaked   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single  crystal was identified as BiOBr (Figure 6c; Figure S12, Supporting Information) while the inner part was   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$  . X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy was used to further investigate the  surface composition of the soaked   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystal with  special attention paid to the O 1s spectra (Figure 6d). A posttreatment of  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$   ion sputtering for  $30~\\mathrm{s}$   was applied to rule out  the possibility that this O 1s peak was originated from physically absorbed oxygen or moisture on the surface. After the  sputtering, only for the soaked sample (surface), a strong peak  located at   $530.6~\\mathrm{eV}$   was observed (Figure 6d, middle trace). By  referring its binding energy to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) database, we ascribed this peak to O element in  BiOBr, a reaction product between   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   and water during  one day soaking. This XPS analysis also echoed our XRD results  and supported our previous hypothesis that our   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs  could be self-passivated by the wide band gap BiOBr on the surface. The XPS spectra of Cs, Bi, and   $\\mathrm{Br}$   are shown in Figure S13  (Supporting Information).  \n\nDue to its excellent stability and robustness, silica is the top  choice for perovskite QD encapsulation. However, lead halide  perovskite QDs are notorious for their extreme moisture sensitivity and the direct encapsulation by silica often resulted  in complete destroy of lead halide perovskite QDs due to the  involvement of water during the hydrolysis of silica precursor.  Porous silica matrix is thus produced in advance, and then  lead halide perovskite precursors  or   $\\mathrm{QDS}^{[55]}$   are filtered into  them to produce the QD/silica matrix. One-pot silica formation and QD incorporation not only simplify the fabrication  process, but more importantly could guarantee a hermetic seal  and better stability. This one-pot encapsulation is only possible  with our   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs thanks to its outstanding water and  acid stability. As shown in  Figure    $\\mathrm{7a}$  , tetraethyl ortho silicate  (TEOS) and   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs were simply mixed together with  the addition of a proper amount of water and HBr to promote  \n\npeak at   $361\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   can be seen from  Figure S14b (Supporting Information). The photo stability and  thermal stability of QD/silica  composites were also measured  (Figure S14c,d, Supporting Information).

Finally,   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QD/silica composites of  good optical clarity were successfully fabricated after gelling in  air naturally (composite film (Figure 7b) and composite powder  (Figure 7c)), and these composites showed bright blue emission when illuminated with a UV lamp (Figure 7d).  \n\nblue-emissive   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs and yellow-emissive   $\\mathrm{Y}_{3}\\mathrm{Al}_{5}\\mathrm{O}_{12}$    (YAG) with violet-emissive GaN chips.
