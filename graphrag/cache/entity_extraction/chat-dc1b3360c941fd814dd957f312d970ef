CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

As a thermal-stable layer, the 2D perovskite capping layer can effectively block the iodide ion diffusion from the  3D perovskite film to the HTM and electrode.  With thicker  2D perovskite capping layers   $(8\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$   PEAI), the 2D-3D PSCs  demonstrated even better thermal stability, maintaining nearly   $90\\%$   of the original PCE after   $100\\textrm{h}$   at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . When aging at  an elevated temperature of   $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , the 2D-3D PSCs based on  the thin and thick 2D perovskite capping layers still can retain  around 60 and  $70\\%$   of the original PCEs, respectively. This relatively deteriorated thermal stability at higher temperature can  be ascribed to the low glass transition temperature   $(\\leq85\\ \\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  of Spiro-OMeTAD with additives.  We anticipated that the  incorporation of robust inorganic HTMs such as  $\\mathrm{CuSCN}$   would  further improve the thermal stability of 2D-3D PSCs.  \n\n# 3. Conclusions  \n\nIn summary, we report a facile strategy to simultaneously  improve the stability and efficiency of 2D-3D PSCs by introducing a rationally designed 2D   $\\mathrm{PEA}_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4}$   capping layer on top  of the 3D perovskite film. Such capping layer induces larger  Fermi-level splitting and reduces non radiative recombination loss in 2D-3D PSCs, leading to a higher   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and thus an  enhanced PCE. The downward shift of quasi-Fermi level calculated in KPFM results is consistent with the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   enhancement  observed in the  $J{\\cdot}V$   measurement. The optimized energy band  alignment and suppressed non radiative recombination with the  incorporation of 2D perovskite capping layer are further verified by the TRPL decay measurements. Moreover, these 2D-3D  stacking layered PSCs showed significantly improved long-term  stability and the majority (nearly   $90\\%$  ) of their original high  efficiency can be retained after exposure in a humid environment for   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$  . Our findings provide an effective strategy to  reduce the voltage losses and address the main hindrance to  the practical application of perovskite devices, which is also  applicable to other perovskite-based op to electronic devices  beyond photovoltaics.  \n\n# 4. Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials and Precursor Preparation : Lead iodide   $(99.9985\\%)$  ,  lead bromide   $(99.999\\%)$  , cesium iodide   $(99.998\\%)$  , and hydroiodic  acid (57   $\\mathsf{w t\\%}$  in water) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar, while  methyl ammonium  bromide  (MABr)  and  Spiro-OMeTAD  were  bought from Dyesol and Borun Chemicals, respectively. Titanium  di iso prop oxide bis(acetyl ace to nate)   $(75\\ \\mathsf{w t\\%}$   in iso prop an ol), dimethyl  sulfoxide (DMSO),  N , N -dimethyl form amide (DMF), chl oro benzene \n\n (CB), acetonitrile (ACN), bis(tri flu oro methane)s ulf on amide lithium \n\n (LiTFSI), and 4- tert -but yl pyr i dine (TBP) were purchased from SigmaAldrich.   $\\mathsf{H C}(\\mathsf{N H}_{2})_{2}\\mathsf{I}$   (form amid in i um iodide, FAI) and   $\\mathsf{C}_{6}\\mathsf{H}_{5}\\mathsf{C}_{2}\\mathsf{H}_{4}\\mathsf{N}\\mathsf{H}_{3}\\mathsf{I}$    (ph en ethyl ammonium iodide, PEAI) were synthesized according to  previously reported methods.  All the purchased chemicals were used  as received unless stated otherwise. To prepare   $\\mathsf{C s}_{0.05}(\\mathsf{F A}_{0.83}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.17})_{0.95}\\mathsf{P}$   ${\\mathsf{b}}({\\mathsf{I}}_{0.83}{\\mathsf{B r}}_{0.17})_{3}$   precursor solution with excess lead iodide, FAI   $(\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{I}}\\-\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{M}})$  , \n\n  ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   (1.1  m ), MABr   $(0.2~\\mathrm{~M~})$  , and   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$   $(0.2~\\mathrm{~M~})$   were dissolved in a  mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO   $(1{:}4\\ \\lor/\\lor)$  , followed by adding CsI  stock solution (  $71.5~\\mathrm{~M~}$  in DMSO) to achieve the desired triple-cation  composition. To obtain the HTM solution,   $72.3\\ \\mathsf{m g}$   of Spiro-OMeTAD  was dissolved in  $1~{\\mathsf{m L}}$   of CB with additives of   $17.5~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of LiTFSI solution   $(520~\\mathsf{m g\\;m L^{-1}}$   in ACN) and   $28.8\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of TBP.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : Patterned FTO glass (FTO22-7, Yingkou OPV)  substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent solution, acetone,  and iso prop an ol. A compact   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   layer   $(50\\ \\mathsf{n m},\\mathsf{c}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathsf{T i O}_{2})$   was first coated  on the clean FTO glass by spray pyrolysis using titanium di iso prop oxide  bis(acetyl ace to nate) in iso prop an ol (1:20, v/v) at   $450~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  , followed by  spin-coating a mesoporous   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   layer   $(200\\ \\mathsf{n m})$   using commercial   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$    nano particle paste (Dyesol, 30 NR-D) diluted in ethanol (1:6 in weight)  at 2500 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  . After drying on   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   hotplate for   $10\\ m i n$  , the  substrates were calcined at   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   in air for 30 min. After cooling down  to room temperature, the perovskite precursor was spin-coated on  mesoporous   $\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   substrates at 2000 rpm for   $\\rceil0\\textsf{s}$   and 6000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  , in which  $200\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of CB was dropped on the spinning substrate   $\\updownarrow5\\;\\mathsf{s}$    prior to the end of second step. The substrates were then annealed on  hotplate at   $65~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$   and   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 60 min to obtain crystalline  3D perovskite films. To grow an additional 2D perovskite layer,   $100~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$    of PEAI solution dissolved in iso prop an ol with different concentrations  (1, 4, and   $8\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}}$  ) were further spin-coated on the as-prepared 3D  perovskite substrates at   $5000\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for   $30\\,\\mathrm{~s~}$  , and annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$    for   $10\\ m i n$  .
