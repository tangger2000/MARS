Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface.

We further found that thermal annealing  could cause the aggregation of nano structures, leading to the  collapse of the hollow structure of the NTs. Such change in  micro structure resulted in a decreased specific surface area  for the annealed PBSCF NTs, thus leading to degraded OER  activity. However, the electrochemical reduction did not alter the  nano structure of PBSCF NTs, and the NTs after electrochemical  reduction demonstrated enhanced OER activity with an overpotential of   $313\\ \\mathrm{\\mV}$   (versus reversible hydrogen electrode  (vs RHE)) at   $10\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (current normalized to the geometric  area of the electrode) and a Tafel slope of   $58\\,\\mathrm{\\mV\\det}^{-1}$  . The  resulting PBSCF NTs deliver superior OER activity compared  to the perovskite electro catalysts reported recently. We believe  the knowledge gained in this work can provide critical insights  into rational design of other electro-catalysts (e.g., sulfides and  nitrides) through defect engineering for a wide range of applications such as fuel cells, electrolysis cells, and rechargeable  metal-air batteries.  \n\n# 2. Results  \n\n# 2.1. Synthesis of PBSCF Model Thin Films with Different  Oxygen Deficiency  \n\nTo avoid the complication arising from the changes in microstructure, PBSCF thin film grown by PLD on inert Yttrium stabilized   $\\mathrm{{ZrO}_{2}}$   (YSZ) (001) single crystal substrates were used as  the model systems for investigating the effects of oxygen vacancies on the intrinsic OER activity. As shown in  Figure   1 a, the  synthesized thin films are poly crystalline and with the same  double perovskite structure as the PLD target.  The films  presented very smooth surface with a roughness of   ${\\approx}0.29\\ \\mathrm{nm}$    (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). The thickness of the  thin film was estimated to be around   $100~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   (Figure 1b). For  electrochemical measurements, a gold pattern was deposited  on the YSZ substrate by sputtering before the films to serve as  current collectors (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). All the  characterization results of the PBSCF thin films shown in the  later part of this manuscript were carried out for the samples  with embedded Au current collector.  \n\nThermal annealing and electrochemical reduction were  used to generate oxygen vacancies in the PBSCF thin films, as  shown in Figure S2b in the Supporting Information. Thermal  annealing was carried out at   $400\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in 1 atm   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   gas atmosphere for a time length of 2, 4, and   $^{\\mathrm{~6~h~}}$  . The annealed samples were named as Film-H-2h, Film-H-4h, and Film-H-6h. The  electrochemical reduction was conducted by applying a negative bias of   $-1.0\\mathrm{~V~}$   (vs   $\\mathrm{Ag/AgCl})$  ) on the film for a time length  of 10, 15, and 20 min in alkaline solution, and the treated samples were referred to as   $\\mathrm{Flim}{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}\\mathrm{V}{\\cdot}10\\ \\operatorname*{min}$  , Film-V-15  min, and  Film-V-20 min. The surface of PBSCF thin film remained very  smooth after thermal annealing (Figure S1b, Supporting Information) and electrochemical reduction (Figure S1c, Supporting  Information), with a surface roughness of less than   $1\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  .  \n\nOwing to its small volumes, the commonly used techniques  for characterizing oxygen non stoic hio me try in bulk materials,  such as thermo grav i metric analysis and dil a tome try, cannot  be used for characterizing thin films.  In this work, XPS and  X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed to detect changes in  the transition metal valence and lattice parameters, respectively.  Such changes could be used to estimate the amount of oxygen  vacancies generated in PBSCF thin films.  \n\nFirst, we probe the transition metal valence state changes  induced by oxygen vacancies using XPS core level spectra. Representative Co 2p XPS spectra of the pristine PBSCF thin films and  the ones subjected to thermal annealing (Film-H-6h) and electrochemical reduction (Film-V-15 min) are shown in Figure 1c. It is  needed to note that the Co  ${2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}}$   and Co   $\\mathrm{2\\mathfrak{p}_{1/2}}$   main peaks overlap  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/993f52976b72bd3b22f35f16427e65b5462da578fd9114293a8f2cc6368f3bd4-1727079873.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   a) XRD patterns of PBSCF target and thin films on YSZ (100) substrates prepared by PLD. b) SEM images of the surface and cross-section  of PBSCF thin films. c)   $\\mathsf{C o}\\,2\\mathsf{p}/\\mathsf{B a}\\,3\\mathsf{d}\\,\\mathsf{X}$  PS spectra and d) XRD patterns of the pristine PBSCF film and the films subjected to   $6\\:\\mathsf{h}$   thermal annealing in   $\\mathsf{H}_{2}$   at  $400~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   (Film-H-6h) and  $\\mathsf{T5\\m i n}$   electrochemical reduction with a negative bias of  $\\left.\\begin{array}{l l}{\\end{array}\\rightleftharpoons}\\\\ {\\left.\\begin{array}{l l}{\\end{array}\\right.}\\end{array}$   (vs   $\\mathsf{A g}/\\mathsf{A g C I})$   (Film-V-15 min). e) Schematics shows the  difference in oxygen vacancy distribution in PBSCF thin film subjected to thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction.   $d_{\\rceil}$   and   $d_{2}$   are the probing  depth of XPS and XRD.  \n\nwith the Ba   $3\\mathrm{d}_{5/2}$   and Ba   $3\\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$   near   ${\\approx}793$   and   ${\\approx}778\\ \\mathrm{eV},$  , respectively (Figure 1c).  Despite the complication brought by such  overlapping, we can still probe the valence state of Co on the  basis of the Co 2p satellite peak position, particularly the satellite  peak for   $\\mathrm{Co}\\ 2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$  , as demonstrated in previous work.  The  reason why these satellite peaks were located at higher binding  energy than the main peak is that the electrons transferred from  the   $\\mathrm{~O~}2\\mathrm{p}$   to the  $\\mathrm{Co}\\ 3\\mathrm{d}$   orbital can screen the electric field of the  holes in the  $\\mathrm{Co}\\,2\\mathrm{p}$   orbital created during the photoelectron emission process. For the pristine PBSCF films, the Co   $2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$   satellite peak located at  ${\\approx}789\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   indicating the Co to be dominated  by   ${C0}^{3+}$  .  After thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction, the Co   $2\\mathsf{p}_{3/2}$   satellite peak was shifted to   ${\\approx}786\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   which  suggested that the Co was reduced to   $C o^{2+}$  (Figure 1c). Because  Fe 2p spectra were overlapped with O Auger peak, we were not  be able to detect the changes in Fe valence states. The presence  of   ${C0}^{{2+}}$  , however, is a clear indication of oxygen vacancy formation on the PBSCF surfaces after both thermal annealing and  electrochemical reduction.  \n\nThe creation of oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides  in many cases can lead to the change in lattice parameters,  which is referred to as the chemical expansion.  Representative XRD patterns of pristine PBSCF thin films, and the films  subjected to thermal annealing and electrochemical reduction  are shown in Figure  1d. After thermal annealing, the film  peaks shifted to a lower two-th\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
