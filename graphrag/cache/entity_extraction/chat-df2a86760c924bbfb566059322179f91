OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

The obtained transparent film  was then heated at  $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 5 min to form a dense   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   film.  \n\nAfter the preparation of perovskite layer, the hole trans-port layer  solution was coated by solution process at 4000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  , where  Spiro-OMeTAD/chl oro benzene   $(72\\,\\mathrm{\\sf~mgl}/1\\,\\mathrm{\\sf~m l})$   solution was employed  with the additives containing  $17.5\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   Li-TFSI/acetonitrile   $(520\\;\\mathsf{m g\\,m L^{-1}})$  )  and  $28.8\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   4- tert -but yl pyr i dine (TBP). Finally, an  $80\\;\\mathsf{n m}$   thick Au counter  electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under reduced pressure  of   $2\\times10^{-7}$   Torr. The active area was  $0.11\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{2}$  .  \n\nDevice Characterization : The current–voltage characteristics were  recorded at a solar simulator (with an aperture of  $40\\times40\\;{\\mathsf{c m}}^{2})$  ) equipped  with a Keithley 2400 source meter and   $300~\\mathrm{\\textperthousand}$   collimated Xenon lamp  (Newport) calibrated with the light intensity to   $100\\,\\textrm{\\textmu}\\!\\mathrm{W}\\textrm{}\\!\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  under  simulated AM 1.5G illumination by a certified silicon solar cell. Incident  photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on a  computer-controlled IPCE system (Newport) containing a Xenon lamp,  a monochromator, and a Keithley multimeter. The system was calibrated  with the certified silicon solar cell and the IPCE data were collected at DC  mode. The TPD-MS measurements were carried out in an in situ pyrolysis  TPD-MS apparatus. The samples were heated from room temperature to   $700~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   with a heating rate of   $5~^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}~{\\mathsf{m i n}}^{-1}$  , while the mass spectra and  sample temperature were recorded. Each spectrum is an accumulation  of 1000 spectra gathered at interval of   $100\\,\\upmu s$  . The typical pressure of the  pyrolytic furnace was kept at   $2\\times10^{-4}$   Pa to prevent secondary reactions.  Before the test, the sample was dried in a vacuum oven at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $24\\ \\mathsf{h}$  . XRD patterns were analyzed by an   $\\mathsf{X}$  -ray diffract o meter (Rigaku,  RINT-2500) with a   ${\\sf C u}~{\\sf K o}$  radiation source. The surface morph o logie s  were recorded on an SEM-4800 field-emission SEM. The IR spectra were  measured on an FTIR spectroscope (IR200, Thermo Nicolet, USA). The  EIS measurements were carried out on a CHI 760E electrochemical  workstation  (Chenhua  Instrument  Company,  Shanghai,  China).  Electron-transporting properties of the ETL materials were carried out  using a space-charge-limited current model with electron-only devices  (FTO/ETL  $I\\,\\mathsf{P C}_{71}\\mathsf{B M}/\\mathsf{A u})$  ).  J – V  characteristics were recorded in the dark by  a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit. The electron mobilities were  extracted by fitting the  $J^{-V}$   curves according to the reported method.   Work function measurements were performed in air by SKPM with an  atomic force microscope (AFM) (Agilent SPM 5500) equipped with a  MAC III controller (three lock-in amplifiers) using a Pt/Ir-coated Si tip  (FMG01/Pt, NT-MDT). A single-pass mode with amplitude modulation  was employed and a Lock-in 1 amplifier was used to drive the cantilever  to get topographic images. Lock-in 2 provided an AC tip bias, and\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
