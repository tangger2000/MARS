Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface.

Inorganic halide per ovsk ites feature merits of  low-cost and easy fabrication methods, robust stability to air  or oxygen, compared to organic counterparts. The feasibility to  tune their morph o logie s from single crystals to nano crystals,  thin films, quantum dots, and colloids promises diverse device  applications.  \n\nAll-inorganic cesium lead halide per ovsk ites   $(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  ,   $X=C{\\mathrm{l}}$  , Br, I) have arisen in recent years as a type of popular  op to electronic material for broad applications ranging from  high-efficiency solar cells, photodetector s, light-emitting diodes,  to lasers.  As cesium lead halide per ovsk ites crystallize in  centro symmetric space groups ( Figure   5 A), they are not expected  to be active in second-order NLO by themselves. However, benefitting from the flexible tunability of perovskite composition and  crystal structure, diverse cesium lead halide perovskite deriva- tives can be created and employed for NLO materials. Nonlinear  optical crystals   $\\mathsf{C s G e}(\\mathrm{Br}_{x}\\mathrm{Cl}_{1-x})_{3}$  , where   $x=0$  ,   $1/6,\\,2/6,\\,3/6,\\,4/6$  ,  5/6, 1, were synthesized and found to exhibit a striking SHG  response which was 28.3 times larger than that of KDP. A linear  increase of   $_x$  caused an increase in lattice constant and secondorder NLO susceptibility but a decrease in bandgap values. In  this way, one can modulate the susceptibility coefficient, energy  bandgap, laser damage threshold, and transparency range of  halides at the same time by anion substitution.  Similar crystal  systems were created by Lin et al. on   $\\mathsf{C s G e}(\\mathrm{Br}_{x}\\mathrm{Cl}_{1-x})_{3}$   with different compositions   $(x\\!=\\!0,\\,1/4,\\,2/4,\\,3/4,\\,1)$  . A linearly increasing   $_x$  increases the Curie temperature, cell volume, second-order  NLO susceptibility, and transparency range but reduces the cell  angle and the force constant.  \n\nSun and co-workers explored for the first time the third-order  NLO properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   nano crystals.  They fabricated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   colloidal nano crystals with a size of   $9\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and observed  strong nonlinear absorption with a large 2PA cross section of \n\n  ${\\approx}1.2\\ \\times10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{GM},$  , as fitted from the open-aperture Z-scan curves \n\n (Figure  5B). Upon laser excitation at 400, 800, and   $1250\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  colloidal nano crystals exhibited one-, two-, and threephoton excited fluorescence, respectively, as confirmed by the  linear, quadratic, and cubic power dependence s. They also  realized low-threshold, photos table, and wavelength tunable  frequency-up converted stimulated green emission by two- and  three-photon pump from these   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   colloidal nano crystals.  Liu et  al. explored the reaction kinetics and fabricated cesium  lead halide per ovsk ites   $\\left(C\\mathrm{s}P\\mathrm{b}C\\right]_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}\\mathrm{'}$  ) nano crystals  with controlled size through a hot-injection approach and anion  exchange reaction (Figure 5E).

The insets are the two-photon excited emission imaging of the NC solution and the best-fitting straight lines  on logarithmic scales: 1 for  $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{3}$   NCs and 2 for  $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{0.53}\\mathsf{B r}_{0.47}$   NCs. E) Synthesis schematic of silica coating on   $\\mathsf{M A P b B r}_{3}$   PQDs. F) Characterization  of the  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   nanosheets, inset (a); WLI image of the nanosheets, inset (b), optical image of the nanosheets. G) PL spectrum under different excitation  densities at room temperature. The inset shows the photograph of colloidal  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs illuminated by an  $800\\,\\mathrm{nm}$   laser beam. H) Open-aperture Z-scan  measurement for  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs and the pure solvent (toluene) at different excitation intensities (at focus). A) Reproduced with permission.
