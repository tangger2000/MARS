CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

TRPL  and PL have been frequently applied to evaluate the quality  of the perovskite films, but the measured lifetime does not  correspond to the charge recombination lifetime in the device  under open-circuit conditions. To find out how pass iv ation  affects the charge recombination process in the devices under  operating conditions, transient photo voltage (TPV) measure­ ment was conducted using the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   perovskite device. The  devices were soaked under AM 1.5G simulated illumination,  and attenuated laser pulses (  $337\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  , 4 ns) were applied to cause  a small disturbance to open-circuited devices, which triggered  a small transient photovoltaic signal. As seen in Figure 5b, the  TPV transient lifetime of the device with DPSI pass iv ation was  increased from 330 ns for the device without DPSI to 536 ns for  the device DPSI pass iv ation. The TPV result also shows that the  device with DPSI pass iv ation had a larger average photo voltage  of   $1.13\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   than the devices without DPSI (1.07 V), which is in  accordance with the  $J{-}V$   measurement. The tDOS, TPV, TRPL,  and PL were also tested on   $\\mathrm{FA}_{0.85}\\mathrm{MA}_{0.15}\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Br}_{0.15}\\mathrm{I}_{0.85})_{3}$  , as shown  in Figures S8–S11 (Supporting Information), and these results  confirmed the conclusion that we draw from the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  .  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the dual function of the  crystallization controlling and trap states pass iv ation enabled  by sulfonic zwitterion for improving of perovskite devices.  This strategy represents a new pathway toward further scal­ able processing of highly performance perovskite solar cells  by combining of the morphology tailoring and defect passiva­ tion. The further understanding of the roles of the functional  ligands in poly crystalline perovskite thin films will be beneficial  for obtaining the large-scale, high uniformity, and low defect  density perovskite thin films to further move the perovskite  devices toward commercialization.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSpin Coating of Perovskite Films : One-step-processed   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.85}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.15}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{B r}_{0.15}\\mathsf{I}_{0.85})_{3}$    per ovsk ites  were  fabricated  by  the  anti solvent extraction approach in the   $\\mathsf{N}_{2}$   glove box. The hole  transport  layer  (HTL),  poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri methyl phenyl)­ amine) (PTAA), with a concentration of   $2\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ \\ m L^{-1}}$   dissolved in  toluene was spin-coated at the speed of   $6000\\,\\mathsf{r p m}$   for 35 s and then  annealed at   $100\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10\\:\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . The   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   perovskite precursor  solution was prepared by dissolving   $460\\ \\mathsf{m g}\\ \\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   and   $159\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu g}$   MAI  in   $700\\ \\upmu L$   DMF and   $78~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   DMSO. The   $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.85}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.15}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{B r}_{0.15}\\mathsf{I}_{0.85})_{3}$  perovskite precursor solution with a concentration of   $].35~\\mathrm{~\\textmu~}$   was  dissolved in mixed solvent   $(\\mathsf{D M F};\\mathsf{D M S O}=4;\\mathsf{I}$  ). The DPSI powder was  directly added to the perovskite precursor solution for the fabrication  of the device with DPSI. To improve the wetting property of perovskite  precursor on PTAA film, the PTAA-coated ITO substrate was prewetted  by spinning   $50~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   DMF at   $4000\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for  $8\\ s$  . Then   $100~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   precursor  solution was spun onto PTAA at 2000 rpm for   $2\\ s$   and 4000 rpm for   $20~\\mathrm{s}$  ; the sample was quickly washed with  $135\\;\\upmu L$   toluene at  $\\mathsf{\\Omega}^{13}\\mathsf{\\ s}$   of the  second-step spin coating. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at   $65~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for 10 min and   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\mathsf{T0}\\,\\mathsf{r n i n}$  .  \n\nBlade Coating of Perovskite Films : The   $\\mathsf{F A}_{0.85}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.15}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{B r}_{0.15}\\mathsf{I}_{0.85})_{3}$  perovskite solution with   $0.04\\ \\mathrm{\\wt\\%}$   of DPSI for blade coating was  prepared similarly with the one-step spin-coating method. The PTAA  with a concentration of   $2\\,\\mathrm{\\sf~mgs~}\\,\\mathrm{\\sf~mL^{-1}}$   dissolved in toluene was spincoated at the speed of 6000 rpm for   $35\\ s$  and then annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $10\\ m i n$  . A drop of perovskite solution   $(\\approx\\mid0~\\upmu\\mathsf{L})$   was supplied by a  pipette and swiped linearly by a film applicator at a speed of  $\\dot{\\mathsf{\\tau}}_{\\approx50\\ \\mathsf{m m}\\ \\mathsf{s}^{-1}}$  on a preheated PTAA-coated ITO/glass substrate at a   $\\mathsf{T45}\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   hotplate.  The gap between blade and substrate was   $100~\\upmu\\mathrm{{m}}$  . After coating, the  perovskite film was annealed for 30 min at  $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .  \n\nPerovskite  Solar  Cell  Fabrication :  The  PCBM  dissolved  in  1,2-dich l oro benzene with a concentration of   $20\\;\\mathrm{~\\textmu~}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}\\;\\mathrm{~\\textmu~}\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$   was  coated onto the perovskite substrate by spin coating at 6000 rpm for   $35\\ \\mathsf{s},$  , and annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The devices were finished by  thermally evaporating   $\\mathsf{C}_{60}$     $(20\\,\\mathsf{n m})$  , BCP   $(8\\,\\mathsf{n m})$  , and copper   $(80\\,\\mathsf{n m})$   in  sequential order.  \n\nDevice  Characterization :  Simulated  AM  1.5G  irradiation   $(\\mathsf{I}\\,00\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\;{\\mathsf{c m}}^{-2})$  ) was produced by a Newport Sol3A solar simulator with  a 450 W xenon source and   $2\\times2$   in. illuminated area for current–voltage  measurements. The light intensity was calibrated by the reference cell  and meter which consists of a readout device and a   $2\\times2$   cm calibrated  solar cell made of\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
