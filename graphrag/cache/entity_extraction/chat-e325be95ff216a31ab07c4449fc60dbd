CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Schematic diagram of bottom-up multiple layer manipulation by DLCH.  \n\n(Supporting Information), it can be observed that there is an amorphous layer of    ${\\approx}1\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   on the outside of  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -DLCH, while the original   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   nanoparticles show clear edges. This further proves that each active functional group of DLCH can chemically interact with the surface of  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   particles. In addition, the lattice spacing of the two grains is   $0.33\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , corresponding to the (110) crystal plane of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  , indicating that the introduction of DLCH does not aﬀect the crystal structure of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   (embedded ﬁgures in Figure  S9a,b , Supporting Information). Subsequently,  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -DLCH was imaged by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) in a high-angle annular dark ﬁeld (HAADF). Figure  S9c,d  (Supporting Information) and d show that the addition of DLCH did not change the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   lattice. From the EDX-mapped image, it can be found that all elements are evenly distributed in the selected area. In addition to   $\\mathrm{Sn}$   and O, S and N elements belonging to DLCH were also observed (Figure  S9e–i , Supporting Information), conﬁrming that DLCH exists in   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  . In Figure  S10 (Supporting Information), we conducted contact angle measurements to explore the wet t ability of pristine and modiﬁed   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  ETLs. Compared with the relatively small contact angle   $(3.20^{\\circ})$  observed for pristine   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ETL, the contact angle of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  - DLCH ETL was increased to   $10.40^{\\circ}$  . The contact angle of   $\\mathrm{{Sno}_{2}}$  ﬁlms exhibited an increase following the modi cation. Huang et al. 38 ]   found that the substrate with appropriate hydrophobicity is favorable for suppressing heterogeneous nucleation and promoting homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, which enabled the preparation of high-aspect-ratio perovskite grains. The introduction of the modiﬁer did not alter the bandgap of  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   (Figure  S5b , Supporting Information). As observed in Figure  4d , it is evident that the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -DLCH ﬁlm displayed notably higher conductivity when compared to the pristine  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   ﬁlm, owing to the eﬀective pass iv ation of oxygen vacancy   $(\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{V}})$   defects and the suppression of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   agglomeration. Subsequently, we assessed electron mobility by analyzing the current-voltage   $(J^{-V})$   curves of electron-only devices using the structure   $\\mathrm{ITO/PCBM/snO_{2}/P C B M/A g}$   and   $\\mathrm{ITO/PCBM/SnO}_{2}$  - DLCH/PCBM/Ag. The electron mobilities were subsequently calculated based on the Mott-Gurney equation (Figure  4e ). 39 ] The electron mobilities for the  $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -DLCH ﬁlms were measured as  $2.63\\times10^{-3}$    and  $4.63\\times10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\mathrm{S}^{-1}$  , respectively, which is ascribed to a reduction in oxygen vacancy   $(\\mathrm{O_{V}})$   defects after modi cation and accordingly enhanced electron transport eﬃciency. We employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to evaluate the surface roughness of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -DLCH ﬁlms. As shown in Figure    $^{4\\mathrm{f},\\mathrm{g}}$  , the introduction of DLCH led to a notable reduction in the roughness from 2.43 to   $1.48~\\mathrm{nm}$  . This reduction indicates that   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}{\\cdot}D L C H}$   exhibited a smoother surface, which can strengthen inter facial contact and facilitate electron extraction and transfer. The substantial improvement in the conductivity and electron mobility of the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -DLCH ETL eﬀectively facilitated electron transport, mitigated interfacial charge accumulation, and suppressed carrier non radiative recombination. These positive factors collectively contributed to the enhancement of all photovoltaic parameters.  \n\nWe investigated the morphology of the control and modiﬁed perovskite ﬁlms through top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements. As exhibited in  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/02c86dc5956ee730fe0d8f5b7e20e5cbfaee8425f174379b2951e4cf7ddad32b-1727106169.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   colloidal solution after the addition of DLCH.

Compared with the control ﬁlm, the modiﬁed sample was stacked more compactly (Figure  5e,f ) and had a smoother surface (Figure S11 , Supporting Information). The grains within the modiﬁed perovskite ﬁlm spanned the entire thickness of the ﬁlm, whereas the cross-section of the control ﬁlm consisted of smaller grains (Figure  5g,h , Supporting Information). These enhancements in grain size, compactness, and smoothness can be attributed to the suppression of heterogeneous nucleation. The ameliorated morphology was expected to facilitate eﬃcient carrier transport and reduce non radiative charge recombination.  \n\nThe crystal structure and crystal lin it y of the perovskite layer were evaluated through X-ray\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
