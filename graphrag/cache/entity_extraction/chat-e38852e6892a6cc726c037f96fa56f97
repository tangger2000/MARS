CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Moreover, good reproducibility is achieved for MPABTTI-based devices as shown in Figure  $4\\mathrm{f,}$  , where the efficiency  histogram shows that   ${>}70\\%$   of the devices   $(\\approx\\!40$   devices) have a  PCE higher than   $20.7\\%$  . To highlight the unprecedented efficiency achieved by MPA-BTTI, the control devices with widely  used HTMs such as PEDOT:PSS,   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{x},$   and PTAA were also  fabricated (Figure S12 and Table S4, Supporting Information).  \n\nUnder the optimal fabrication conditions, these devices showed  the maximum PCEs of   $17.11\\%$  ,   $19.49\\%$  , and   $19.85\\%$  , respectively, which are significantly lower compared to that of the  MPA-BTTI-based device.  \n\nAs discussed above, MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI possess similar photo physical and electrochemical properties but greatly  different molecular configuration which will affect not only  the intrinsic hole-transporting capacity but also the material  packing motif and the resultant film morphology. Since the  hole mobility and conductivity of MPA-BTTI is indeed not very  high compared to other SM-HTMs reported in literature, hence the ultrahigh efficiency achieved by MPA-BTTI is likely  related to its film morphology, which can dominate the growth  of perovskite active layer on top and largely affect the interfacial contact. To probe the effects of SM-HTMs on perovskite  formation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was first performed and the images are shown in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information. Apparently, the average size   $(\\approx\\!400\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) of  perovskite grains on MPA-BTTI is larger than that   $(\\approx\\!320\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  )  on MPA-BTI. Furthermore, the higher intensity of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of perovskite films on MPA-BTTI indicates its  greater film crystal lin it y (Figure S14, Supporting Information).  Based on the cross-section SEM images (Figure  4b), smooth  multilayer structure and compact perovskite film for the MPABTTI-based device with very large crystalline grains were clearly  observed. The increased grain size is likely contributed to two  factors, namely, the increased hydrophobic it y and the improved  thermal stability of MPA-BTTI. The smooth and hydrophobic surface of MPA-BTTI facilitates the growth of large  size perovskite grains by suppressing heterogeneous nucleation.  Increased thermal stability of MPA-BTTI compared to  MPA-BTI contributes to improved quality of perovskite film  on top due to the fact that annealing step in the preparation  of CsFAMA perovskite (at   $100\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$   will induce phase transition  in the underlying MPA-BTI film with a low   $T_{\\mathrm{g}}$   of   $86~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , which  could adversely affect the perovskite growth and the inter facial  interaction. In fact, we can observe that MPA-BTI annealed  at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   exhibits higher roughness compared to MPA-BTTI  annealed at   $110~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Consequently, the excellent morphological and thermal properties  of MPA-BTTI result in the formation of high-quality perovskite  poly crystalline film with low degree of defects, which enhances   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF in PVSCs due to the better light-harvesting capability  and prolonged carrier diffusion length.  \n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was conducted to further probe the HTM/perovskite interfaces. As  reported in the literature, functional groups with lone electron  pairs such as carbonyl and cyano groups can form coordination sites with   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   defects in perovskite film.  Hence, FTIR  spectra of pure MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI, and the mixed films  of MPA-BTI/  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and MPA-BTTI/  $\\mathrm{{'}P b I_{2}}$   were characterized.  As shown in Figure S15 in the Supporting Information, the  stretching vibration of carbonyl groups in MPA-BTI and MPABTTI is located at 1652 and   $1640~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , respectively, and additional peaks at 1701 and   $1699~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   appear after blending with   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$  , which suggests the existence of interaction between  SM-HTMs and  $\\mathrm{Pb}$   ions in the perovskite films. In addition, normalized steady-state photo luminescence (PL) spectra at room  temperature can further confirm such interactions. As shown in  Figure S16 in the Supporting Information, the emission peak  of perovskite deposited on the SM-HTM is slightly blue shifted   $({\\approx}5\\ \\mathrm{\\nm})$  , which is consistent with the findings in previous  reports.  The good inter facial contact may passivate defects  at HTM/perovskite interface and consequently reduce recombination loss and enhance device efficiency.  \n\nTo investigate the non radiative recombination losses in  PVSCs, the steady-state PL spectra were measured, as shown  in Figure S17 in the Supporting Information. The PL intensity was quenched sharply for the MPA-BTI/perovskite film  and even more significantly for the MPA-BTTI/perovskite film,  which indicates more efficient hole transfer at the interface  between MPA-BTTI and perovskite layer. The time-resolved  photo luminescence (TRPL) measurements were then carried  out as illustrated in Figure S18 in the Supporting Information  with the data of carrier lifetime summarized in Table S5 in the  Supporting Information. All of the PL decay curves exhibit biexponential lifetimes with an initial fast decay   $(\\tau_{1})$\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
