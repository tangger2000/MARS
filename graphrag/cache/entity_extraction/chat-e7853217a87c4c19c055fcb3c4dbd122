CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The DOS of the electronic state of  the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation in the ideal   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   structure has been calculated, as shown in  Figure    6 .

The dissociated molecules have the respective energy levels shown in the bottom right and left panels. c) Scheme of the  stable fragments considered in the present work, under stoic hio metric conditions. For each configuration, the molecular levels closer to the bandgap  region are indicated. In particular, amine groups display localized lone-pair HOMO and LUMO orbitals well into the bandgap. d) Endothermic DTA  peaks for the decomposition reaction of   $\\mathsf{M A P b X}_{3}$   crystals. In the case of  $\\mathsf{M A P b B r}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$  , the endothermic peak of the decomposition event convolutes with the endothermic peak of the melting process of the corresponding lead halide; hence, the contribution of each process was separated by  a peak fitting procedure (sum of gaussians). The “shape index” of each decomposition peak was used to obtain the order of reaction. a–c) Reproduced  with permission.  Copyright 2015, American Physical Society. d) Reproduced with permission.

The   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   bond is broken in route (c). The large formation energies  are related to the low concentration of localized defects, but  the final products of dissociation result from non equilibrium  solution processing. They are also produced under ultraviolet  irradiation and are very stable. These products create point  defects such as vacancies, interstitial defects, and substitutions.  \n\nThe dissociation of MAI to   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}–\\mathrm{I}$   can occur via  route (a). The dissociated   $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$   has three electrons in an equal  number of   $_\\mathrm{N-H}$   bonds and has another two in the lone-pair  HOMO with an   $\\mathrm{N}(2\\mathrm{p})$   orbital character. On the other hand,   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$   is highly electronegative. Hence, it migrates and reacts  with I. The   $_{\\mathrm{C-I}}$   bond axis in the formed   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}–\\mathrm{I}$   (io do methane)  complex  is parallel to the   $\\mathrm{PbI_{4}}$   unit. In route (b), the dissociated MA forms stable   $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$   (methane in Figure 6b), and   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$  can migrate/react with   $\\mathrm{I^{-}}$   ions. Thus,   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\mathrm{I}$   (iodoamine) is  formed.  The electronic energy of methane is far from the  main energy region of the light absorber. Interstitial   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\mathrm{I}$   is  located at the bottom of the conduction band with the L\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
