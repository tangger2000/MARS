CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

However,  the efficiencies of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells  achieved to date are still low, principally  as the result of poor   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film quality,  which induces a low short circuit current  and poor stability.  Therefore, it is very  desirable to control the crystallization process of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   for dense, uniform, and  stable perovskite films.  \n\nThe op to electronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to  the film quality, so depositing dense, uniform, and stable perovskite  films is crucial for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells  (PSCs).  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   perovskite, prized for its superb stability toward  light soaking and thermal aging, has received a great deal of attention  recently. However, the air instability and poor performance of   $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$    PSCs are hindering its further progress. Here, an approach is reported  for depositing high-quality   $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films via the Lewis base adducts   $\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})$   and  $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})$   as precursors to slow the crystallization of  the perovskite film. This process produces  $\\mathsf{c s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films with large-scale  crystalline grains, flat surfaces, low defects, and long carrier lifetimes.  More interestingly,   $\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})$   and  $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}(\\mathsf{D M S O})$   adducts could  significantly improve the stability of   $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   films in air. Using films  prepared by this technique, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of   $\\mathbf{14.78\\%}$    is obtained in  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PSCs, which is the highest PCE value reported  for   $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$  -based PSCs to date. In addition, the PSCs based on DMSO  adducts show an extended operational lifetime in air. These excellent  performances indicate that preparing high-quality inorganic perovskite  films by using DMSO adducts will be a potential method for improving the  performance of other inorganic PSCs.  \n\nIn particular, it is generally accepted that  obtaining high-quality perovskite films is  a prerequisite to making high-efficiency  PSCs.  Therefore,  various  fabrication  methodologies, such as one-step-coating  deposition,   sequential  deposition,  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nspray-assisted solution-process,  and vacuum evaporation,   have been developed to produce high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films  with flat surfaces and large grains by controlling the crystallization processes of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films. Among these methodologies, the one-step-coating deposition method is simple and  solution-processed. However, according to the literature, it is  still challenging to deposit a thick, uniform, and stable CsP $\\mathrm{bI}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with a low defect density and long carrier lifetime  by a one-step solution-based process.  Therefore, a simple,  low-cost, and one-step method for preparing high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   films is highly desired for the further development of  inorganic PSCs.  \n\nRecently, cesium-based trihalide per ovsk ites   $\\mathrm{(CsMX_{3}}$  ,   ${\\mathrm{M}}\\,=\\,{\\mathrm{Pb}}$    or   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  ;   $X=\\mathrm{I}$  , Br, Cl, or mixed halides) as a class of inorganic  per ovsk ites have drawn considerable attention owing to their  superb compositional and thermal stability as well as their  promise for use in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), perovskite  \n\nThe Lewis acid-base adduct approach is an effective  method for controlling the quality of perovskite film. It has  been demonstrated that the existence of Lewis bases, such as  dimethyl s ulf oxide (DMSO), in the annealing process could  significantly promote perovskite grain growth.  Previously  reported works have also demonstrated that DMSO can coordinate with   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   to form an intermediate phase   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(\\mathrm{DMSO})$    for retarding the rapid reaction between   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and organic  iodide (MAI, FAI) in the solution, which is beneficial for  adjusting the crystal growth processes of  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$  films.  However, the DMSO adducts, such as   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(\\mathrm{DMSO})$  and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}(\\mathrm{DMO})$  , have not yet been explored to obtain highquality all-inorganic perovskite films for high-performance  photo electronic devices.  \n\nHere, we synthesize the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(\\mathrm{DMSO})$   and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}(\\mathrm{DMO})$  adducts as precursors to replace   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$   in the conventional inorganic perovskite solution, and found that these  DMSO adducts can effectively retard the fast reaction between   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  ,   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  , and CsI during the evaporation of solvent in  a glovebox or in air. The DMSO adducts can also protect the  freshly-coated perovskite film in high-humidity air. By using  the DMSO adducts, we can obtain a high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  perovskite film with large grain size and low defect density  through a one-step solution-based process. As a result, the allinorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells fabricated with DMSO adducts  exhibit high photo currents and photo voltages, owing to the  improved quality of the perovskite layers, eventually resulting  in the highest reported PCE of   $14.78\\%$   to date for all inorganic  PSCs. In addition, the inorganic PSCs show excellent stability,  retaining more than   $97\\%$   of their initial\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
