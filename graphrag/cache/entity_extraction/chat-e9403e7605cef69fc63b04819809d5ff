Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface.

Especially, the  emerging lead halide perovskite   $(\\mathrm{APbX}_{3}$  ,  where   $\\mathrm{~A~}=$  methyl ammonium MA, Cs;   $\\mathrm{X}\\,=\\,\\mathrm{Cl}$  , Br, I) QDs are very exciting due  to the low-cost solution synthesis process  and the continuously tunable band gap  by tuning halide compositions and crystal  size.  Comparing to traditional metal  chal co geni de QDs such as   $\\mathrm{CdSe},^{[7-9]}$   lead  halide perovskite QDs show comparable  PLQY   $(>\\!90\\%)$  , narrower full width at halfmaximum (FWHM: 12–25 nm), and wider  color gamut   $(\\approx\\!150\\%$   national television  standards committee (NTSC)), making  them very promising candidates for future  lighting and display applications.  Leadbased perovskite QDs also showed decent  performances for other op to electronic  applications.  However, the severe toxicity of lead and its accumulative nature  in human body can be a great hindrance  to practical applications. The replacement  of lead with nontoxic metal in perovskite  materials is highly desirable for commer  \n\nLead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) possess color-tunable and  narrow-band emissions and are very promising for lighting and display  applications, but they suffer from lead toxicity and instability. Although  lead-free Bi-based and Sn-based perovskite QDs   $(\\mathbb{C}\\mathfrak{s}\\mathfrak{s n}\\mathfrak{X}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{S n X}_{6},$   and   $(\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3})_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{X}_{9})$   are reported, they all show low photo luminescence quantum  yield (PLQY) and poor stability. Here, the synthesis of   $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   perovskite  QDs with high PLQY and excellent stability is reported. Via a green and facile  process using ethanol as the anti solvent, as-synthesized  $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QDs show  a blue emission at  $\\bf{410\\,n m}$   with a PLQY up to  $19.4\\%$  . The whole series of   $\\mathsf{c s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{X}_{9}$     $\\textstyle({\\mathsf{X}}={\\mathsf{C l}}$  , Br, and I) QDs by mixing precursors can cover the photoluminescence emission range from 393 to  $\\mathbf{545}\\;\\mathsf{n m}$  . Furthermore,  $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QDs  show excellent photo stability and moisture stability due to the all-inorganic  nature and the surface pass iv ation by BiOBr, which enables the one-pot  synthesis of  $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QD/silica composite. A lead-free perovskite white lightemitting diode is fabricated by simply combining the composite of  $\\mathsf{c s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$    QD/silica with  $\\mathsf{Y}_{3}\\mathsf{A l}_{5}\\mathsf{O}_{12}$   phosphor. As a new member of lead-free perovskite  QDs,  $\\mathsf{C s}_{3}\\mathsf{B i}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}_{9}$   QDs open up a new route for the fabrication of op to electronic  devices due to their excellent stability and photo physical characteristics.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\n# cia liz ation of these materials.  \n\nThe significant recent efforts in developing lead-free (such  as   $\\mathrm{Sn}.$  - and Bi-based) colloidal perovskite QDs or nano crystals  have encountered several problems. There have been only two  reports, to the best of our knowledge, on Sn-based perovskite  nano crystals, one with   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{sn}\\mathrm{X}_{3}$   and the other about   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}S n X_{6}}.$    both of which are prepared by the hot injection method. Unfortunately, rather low PLQYs of   $0.14\\%$     $(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{sn}X_{3})^{[16]}$   and   $0.48\\%$     $(\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{Sn}X_{6})^{[17]}$   were observed, which were found to be related  with the oxidation process from   $\\mathrm{{sn}(I I)}$   to   $\\mathrm{{sn}(I V)}$   for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{sn}\\mathrm{X}_{3}$  ,  and also the presence of abundant intrinsic defect sites in both  of them, a common problem in Sn-based per ovsk ites. More  recently, our group has reported the organic–inorganic hybrid  bismuth per ovsk ites QDs   $\\mathrm{(MA_{3}B i_{2}X_{9}}$  ,   $X=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{l}$   Br, and I) and  demonstrated a PLQY of   ${\\approx}12\\%$  .    $\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   has 2D crystal  structure and consequently equal or even lower than 2D electronic dimension, which leads to increased exciton binding  energy and even the formation of trapped exciton, beneficial  for high PLQY.  However, the PLQY of   $\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   is still  unsatisfactory compared to   $\\mathrm{Pb}$  -based analogs especially  $\\mathrm{A}_{2}\\mathrm{PbX}_{4}$    in the same wavelength, thus calling for further improvement. In parallel, organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide per ovsk ites  are extremely sensitive to moisture, heat, and potentially oxygen,  \n\nQuantum dots (QDs), featuring various favorable properties such as narrow-band emission and high photo lu minescence quantum yield (PLQY), have drawn extensive attention  \n\nwhich imposes the constraint of a controlled environment for  fabrication, storage, and device operation, commonly notorious  in organic op to electronic materials.  Compared with hybrid  per ovsk ites, all-inorganic per ovsk ites generally exhibit higher  thermal stability, less moisture sensitivity, and lower defect  concentration, and therefore show higher PLQY and better stability.  In addition, all-inorganic   ${\\mathrm{Cs}}_{3}{\\mathrm{Bi}}_{2}{\\mathrm{I}}_{9}$   thin films have  already been applied in solar cells and showed a higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity than   $\\mathrm{MA_{3}B i_{2}I_{9}}$  .  \n\nHere, we report the synthesis and optical characterization of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}X_{9}}$   perovskite QDs. Colloidal QDs of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   were synthesized by a simple and green method using ethanol as the main  solvent. The photo luminescence peak can be tuned from 393  to   $545~\\mathrm{nm}$   with different halide compositions made via mixing  different precursors during synthesis. For   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs, we  observed an emission peak at  $410\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   and an FWHM of   $48~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  ,  and a small stokes shift of   $15~\\mathrm{nm}$   and a PLQY of   ${\\approx}19.4\\%$  . This  PLQY is higher than the all\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
