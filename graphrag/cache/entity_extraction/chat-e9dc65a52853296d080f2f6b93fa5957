Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

As a  result, in order to reduce the severe recombination, 1D   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nano structures were used to replace nano particle films. Unlike  nanoparticles, the 1D ZnO nano structure usually is single  crystal and provides a direct pathway for electron transport. Among various 1D structures, ZnO nanorods is the most  widely used material for solar cells.  \n\nA traditional method of fabricating   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods is hydrothermal method. The hydrothermal method is a synthesis  method of crystal materials in hot water or organic solvents  under high temperature. The basic principle of hydrothermal  method for   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   synthesis is as follows. A Zn salt and alkali,  e.g., KOH or hex a methylene tetra mine, are dissolved into the  solvent. The   $\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$   in the solution react with each  other to form   $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)}_{2}$   precipitates. As the reaction proceeds,  the temperature and pressure increase, the   $\\mathrm{pH}$   of the solution  increases gradually, and the concentration of   $\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}$  decreases,  which leads to decomposition and dehydration of   $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)}_{2}$  precipitates. Finally, the   $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)}_{2}$   precipitates convert into   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  .  Like other solution based synthesis methods, the morphology and doping of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods can be realized by tuning  the composition and concentration of precursor, reaction temperature, and time.  \n\nZnO nanorods were introduced into PSCs by Bi et al. in  2013.  They fabricated the PSCs on the basis of experience  and knowledge accumulated from traditional DSSCs. In their  research, by using   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   as the sensitizer and combining solid  spiro-OMeTAD HTM and   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods ETM, they prepared  PSCs with the structure of Au/spiro-MeOTAD/  $\\mathrm{{\\small{\\calM}A P b I_{3}}/}$  nanorods/seed layer/FTO. The  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods were synthesized  from the hydrothermal method. Compact   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   film prepared  from   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   colloids was used as a seed layer for hydrothermal  as well as a hole block layer. The obtained   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods were  vertically aligned on the substrate. The   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$   sensitizer was  made from a precursor solution   $(\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}{:}\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{I}\\,=\\,1{:}1,$  , molar  ratio,   $40\\,\\mathrm{\\w{t}\\%}$   in   $\\nsucc$  Bu tyrol act one) by spin coating. After spin  coating, the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   will penetrate into the space between the  nanorods without affecting   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods. They studied the  relation between the nanorods length and cell performance. It  was found that the length of nanorods plays a key role in cell  efficiency. To certain extent, with increasing the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods  length, the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}},$   FF,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   and PCE of solar cells increase but the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   may decrease. This is mainly because the length of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanorods determines the electron transport time and lifetime, which will directly affect the performance of solar cells.  Although the best PCE they gained is only about   $5.0\\%$  , the work  opens a new direction for the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   ETM based PSCs.  \n\nSimilar study has been reported by Son et al.  In their  research, they fabricated PSCs with the same device structure.  Because the morphology and quality of perovskite materials  fabricated by the initial one step coating process cannot be  tightly controlled. Perovskite cannot always completely fill and  cover the space between the nanorods, and the spiro-OMeTAD  can permeate into these unfilled holes and contact with   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanorods, which will form shunt path and deteriorate the performance of solar cells. Therefore, they used a two-step coating  method to replace the one step method used by Bi et al.  The  cross-sections of PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods of different  lengths were shown in Figure 5e–g. As can be seen, the twostep coating method produced a fully filled perovskite film that  covered all   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods of different lengths without voids  and formed an overlayer on the nanorods surface. Additionally, the two step coating procedure optimizes the cuboid size  of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   and then decreases the series resistance of the PSC,  which is favored by solar cells.  As a result, combing the two  step coating method with the optimized nanorods length, a best  PCE of   $11.13\\%$   was obtained.  \n\nFurther research on the relation between the nanorods  length and solar cell performance was carried out either. The   $J{-}V$   curves, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra together  with EQE data-based integrated current density for the PSCs  based on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods of different lengths are shown in  Figure 5h,i. As can be seen, with the increase of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods  length, the PCE,  ${\\cal J}_{\\mathrm{sc}},$   and EQE of solar cell increase too, while  the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   decreased. The increase of PCE and   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   are because  longer nanorods increase the charge extraction efficiency and  the nanorods also act as scattering centers to increase the light  absorption, which is confirmed by the UV–Vis absorption  spectra of the perovskite films on   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods of different  lengths shown in Figure 5j. The decrease of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   can be attributed to larger inter facial area induced by increasing nanorods  length, which increased the recombination at the same time.  \n\nBesides the length of nanorods, the seed layer plays an  important role in the ZnO nanorods growth and photovoltaic  performance of the solar cells.  The so-called seed layer  is usually a compact ZnO film, which is usually fabricated by  solution processes. Generally, there are three kinds of precursor  solutions that can be used to fabricate   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   seed layers. The precursor solutions can be zinc salt solution, ZnO colloids, or   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nano particle solution. Son et al. systematically deposited three  different   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   seed layers based on each precursor solution and  studied the influence of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods growth and photovoltaic  performance of PSCs.  According to their results, the seed  layer can affect the properties of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods. Seed layer produced from the colloid solution can fully cover the substrate, and  however, the seed layer made from the zinc salt solution or  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  nano particle solution does not provide a full coverage. The poor  coverage of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   films tends to form shut paths. ZnO nanorods  grown on a colloid seed layer showed not only a good coverage  but also enhanced transmittance over the range of visible wavelengths. The shunts caused by the poor coverage decrease the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and photo current density, as shown in Figure   $5\\mathrm{kJ}$  . In addition, recombination at the perovskite/ZnO interface was suppressed for the cell using the seed layer prepared by the colloid  solution. This work directly proved the important role of the  seed layers for the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanorods based PSCs.  \n\nOn the other hand, considering the unique structure and  morphology of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanor\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
