CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

In this case, the lowest energy hole should be  confined in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   core and the electron can delocalize  over the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   core and   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell, which could facilitate the  charge transfer and decrease the PL QY. In addition, a faster  emission decay with   ${\\approx}2.1$   ns average lifetime of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   NCs compared with that of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs   $(14.8~\\mathrm{~ns})$   \n\n (Figure 5c and Table S1, Supporting Information) might suggest a rapid charge transfer from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs to the   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$    shell. The optical data (absorption, PL, and PL lifetime) of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs are consistent with reported   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell  coated type II  $\\mathrm{CdSe/TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs.  However, it should  be noted that a trace amount of water during the calcination  process can react with the corners and edges of the nanocubes  as indicated by the rounded shape of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   within the  core/shell NCs.  These surface reactions could generate surface defect and contribute to the decreased PL intensity.  \n\nThe charge transport properties of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   NCs  were further tested by photo electrochemical study. A smaller  semicircle arc and a greatly reduced recombination rate at  high frequencies for   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs from electro chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (in the form of  Nyquist plots, Figure 5d) was observed, demonstrating that  the charge transfer resistance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs is significantly  decreased upon the formation of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell  NCs.  This result was further confirmed by transient photocurrent responses which shows that the assembled   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/$   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs demonstrate an enhanced cathodic  photo current,  ${\\approx}2$   times larger, compared to the dried   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$    NC powder in 0.1  m    $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{4}$   aqueous solution   $(\\mathrm{pH}=6.8\\$  , upon  irradiation by 405 LED light) at an applied potential of   $-0.1\\mathrm{~V~}$    versus NHE (Figure 5e).

To show the contribution of dark  current, we conducted a light on/off measurement after the  6 h photo current measurement. As shown in Figure 5f, there  is a small increase of dark current (shown in stars in Figure 5f)  compared to that of starting time of illumination, which contribute to the small increase of the total current density.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/3efc5a65bccd05a0950f0b3c1d25ba9c9b59f15fa20389121e99915275915e89-1723826845.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   NC powder and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   NCs after calcination at  $300~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $5\\,\\mathsf{h}$  ; b) Steadystate PL spectra of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   powder and  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}\\,\\mathsf{N C s};\\mathsf{c})$  ) Time-resolved PL spectra of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   powder and  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  NCs; d) Electrochemical  impedance spectra (Nyquist plot) of  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   powder and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}\\;\\mathsf{N C}$  s, inset is the equivalent circuit model and  $Z^{\\prime}$   and   $-Z^{\\prime\\prime}$   are the virtual and  real impedances, respectively; e) Transient photo current responses to on-off illumination of   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   powder and   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   NCs electrodes at   $-0.1$   V versus NHE in neutral water (0.1  m    $\\mathsf{N a}_{2}\\mathsf{S O}_{4}$  ,   $\\mathsf{p H}=6.8,$  );  $\\mathsf{f})$   Controlled potential electrolysis of the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   NCs electrode in neutral water  within  $8~\\mathsf{h}$  .

Conclusions  \n\nIn summary, we have developed a facial method for the  coating of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs, which can serve as  an efficient protective layer for   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs. The resulting   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}/\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$   core/shell NCs are ultra stable and exhibit excellent water stability for more than 12 weeks with size, morphology, and crystal lin it y unchanged along with the added  protection against anion exchange and photo degradation. Furthermore, the encapsulating   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs into the electrical  conductive thin layer   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell allows for efficient photo­ induced charge transfer and enhanced photoelectric activity in  real water testing. This work would provide new opportunities  for the design and utilization of perovskite NCs as a visiblelight photo catalyst for solar energy conversion in aqueous  solution.  \n\n# 4.
