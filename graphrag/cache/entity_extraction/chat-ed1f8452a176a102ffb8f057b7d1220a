CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

By contrast, the EL peak of treated LEDs remained stable, demonstrating the e ect ive ness of the bi-ligand strategy in preventing the phase separation (Figure  $^{4\\mathrm{g,h,}}$  ). We also obtained the electroluminescence spectra of   $\\mathrm{L}_{90}$  ,   $\\mathrm{L}_{70}$  , and  $\\mathrm{L}_{50}$   (Figure  S13a,b , Supporting Information). As time progressed, the emission peaks of the control LED exhibited a shift due to halogen ion segregation under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld. However, the emission peaks of the treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   LED remained stable, which are consistent with the results that the introduction of AHI/OI suppresses halogen ion migration. To further demonstrate this inhibition of halogen ion migration, we employed time-of-ﬂight secondary-ion mass spectrometry to measure the element distribution of the fresh and  $\\mathrm{L}_{50}$   aged  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   LEDs with AHI/OI treatment (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). The analysis revealed no halide distribution changes in the fresh and aged LEDs, consistent with the stable EL spectra of   $\\mathrm{L}_{90}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{L}_{70}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{L}_{50}$   in the treated ﬁlms.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn summary, the bi-ligand synergy strategy increases the vacancy formation energy of halogen ions through the synergy of biligand, thus inhibiting the generation and migration of halogen ion vacancies. This allows us to prepare  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms with low defect density, high stability, and high PLQY. Through the use of the treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   nano crystals, we achieve  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   LEDs with a record EQE of   $21.2\\%$   approaching Rec.2100 standards for pure red emissions (0.698, 0.301). The biligand synergy strategy is helpful to improve the stability of mixed lead halide nano crystals and has important guiding sign i can ce for improving mixed lead halide per ovsk ites LED devices.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nH.W.D. and F.Z. contributed equally to this work.
