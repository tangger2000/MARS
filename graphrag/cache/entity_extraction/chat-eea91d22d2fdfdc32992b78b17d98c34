Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a.

Actually, the  power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs  has increased quickly to   $25.2\\%$   in the last  8 years.  However, many issues including  current–voltage hysteresis, poor stability,  toxicity of lead, and inferior water resistance  are stumbling blocks to the commercial  road for PSCs.  Refer to above challenges,  all-inorganic lead-free per ovsk ites were proposed considering their better stability and  environmental friendliness.  \n\nPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) are highly promising next-generation photovoltaic devices because of the cheap raw materials, ideal band gap of  $\\tt{\\dot{\\Pi}}_{\\approx1.5}$   eV,  broad absorption range, and high absorption coefficient. Although lead-based  inorganic-organic PSC has achieved the highest power conversion efficiency  (PCE) of  $\\pmb{25.2\\%}$  , the toxic nature of lead and poor stability strongly limits the  commercialization. Lead-free inorganic PSCs are potential alternatives to  toxic and unstable organic-inorganic PSCs. Particularly, double-perovskite   $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g B i B r}_{6}$  -based PSC has received interests for its all inorganic and lead-free  features. However, the PCE is limited by the inherent and extrinsic defects  of  $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g B i B r}_{6}$   films. Herein, an effective and facile strategy is reported for  improving the PCE and stability by introducing an N719 dye interlayer, which  plays multi functional roles such as broadening the absorption spectrum,  suppressing the charge carrier recombination, accelerating the hole extraction, and constructing an appropriate energy level alignment. Consequently,  the optimizing cell delivers an outstanding PCE of   $\\pmb{2.84\\%}$  , much improved as  compared with other  $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g B i B r}_{6},$  -based PSCs reported so far in the literature.  Moreover, the N719 interlayer greatly enhances the stability of PSCs under  ambient conditions. This work highlights a useful strategy to boost the PCE  and stability of lead-free  $\\mathsf{c s}_{2}\\mathsf{A g B i B r}_{6}$  -based PSCs simultaneously, accelerating  the commercialization of PSC technology.  \n\nThe alternative environmentally friendly  cations for bivalent   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  including bivalent   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+},\\ G e^{2+}}$  , and trivalent   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$  ,   ${\\mathrm{St}}^{3+}$    according to the similar ion radius and  electronic configuration of   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}.^{\\left[6-8\\right]}}$   Unfortunately, the   $\\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ge^{2+}}$   are easily oxidized to   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Ge^{4+}}$  respectively,   which leads to low stability, even though  the recent   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Sn}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Ge}_{0.5}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$  -based inorganic  PSC has reached a PCE of   $711\\%$   More  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nover, trivalent   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{St}^{3+}$  -based halide per ovsk ites generally  exhibit low-dimensional structure of   $\\mathrm{A^{+}{}_{3}B^{3+}{}_{2}X_{9}}$  , which demonstrate unfavorable op to electronic properties, including low charge  carrier transport rate and high exciton binding energy, resulting  in very low PCEs.  In order to replacing   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   with environmentally benign   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   while maintaining the 3D structure at the  same time, halide double per ovsk ites (HDPs) with the structure of   $\\mathrm{A^{+}2B^{+}B^{3+}X_{6}}$   were designed, where two bivalent   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   are  substituted with one monovalent   $\\mathrm{B^{+}}$  and one trivalent   $\\mathrm{B}^{3+}$  .   Recently,   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  , as an important HDP, has been successfully synthesized and become one of most emerging materials in solar energy conversion fields, including photovoltaic,  photo­ catalysis, and photodetector.  Several groups have successfully fabricated   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$   films for PSCs through vapor  deposition and solution processing routes.  However, up  to now, the reported PCEs for the corresponding PSCs are still  low due to the inherent drawbacks of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$  , such as large  indirect band gap, large charge carrier effective masses, low  charge carrier transport capability, and poor sunlight absorption  \n\nOrganic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have  received tremendous attention since the first solid-state solar cell  \n\ncapability.  In addition, due to the extrinsic defects that  slight solubility of halides in general organic solvents and high  annealing temperature of at least   $250~{}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for the pure-phase   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$   formation, it is a big challenge for the preparation  of high-quality and single-phase perovskite films that is also  crucial for achieving high PCEs. For above reasons, the highest  reported PCE of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  -based PSC is only   $2.51\\%$   until  now,  although the theoretical PCE for   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$  -based PSCs  is   $8\\%$   according the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency  (SLME) calculations. Therefore, this is still a big room for further  improvement in the PCE of the  $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  -based lead-free PSCs.  \n\nIn this work, we put forward a simple strategy for improving  the PCE and operating stability of  $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  - -based PSC without  the need to change the available matured method for cell fabrication. The key point for current strategy is to apply an interlayer  of N719 dye (di-tetra but yl ammonium  cis -bis(iso th ioc yana to) bis \n\n  $_{(2,2^{\\prime}}$  -bipyridyl-4,4 ′  di carboxyl a to) ruthenium (II)) on the surface of \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$   films. Such dye interlayer acts multiple functions by  broadening the light absorption spectrum, reducing the surface  defects of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgBiBr}_{6}$   films, and accelerating the hole extraction at  the same time. As a result, a PCE up to  $2.84\\%$   (short-circuit current  density   $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\right)$  :   $5.13\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}$  ; open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{oc}})$  : 1.06 V) was  reached by the  $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g B i B r_{6}}$  -based PSC with the N719 dye interlayer.  In addition, the obtained cells showed obviously improved stability against the surrounding atmosphere. Our work provides an  efficient and convenient approach of improving the photoelectric  efficiency and operational stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
