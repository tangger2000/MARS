CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

Despite the EQE of sky-blue  LEDs (wavelength range:  $480–490\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) has  rapidly advanced to over   $10\\%$  ,  this wavelength range cannot meet the requirements of the National Television System  Committee (NTSC) standards (pure blue:   $460{-}470\\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ).  Although cutting-edge  pure PeLEDs emitting at   $470~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   with an  EQE of   $6.3\\%$   have been reported, they  were still plagued by critically low luminance   $(465~\\mathrm{cd}~\\mathrm{m}^{-2})$  ) and acutely short lifetime (approximately several minutes).   More  importantly,  pure-blue  PeLEDs  are still in their first stages of development and exhibit both poor brightness   $(<\\!1000\\ \\mathrm{cd}\\ m^{-2})$   and short operational halflife   $(<\\!1\\,\\mathrm{~h})$  , which are strictly hindering  their application in display technologies.  Therefore, designing high-performance  pure-blue PeLEDs for satisfying the  NTSC standards remains an unresolved  challenge.  \n\nThe research on metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with  green and infrared emission has demonstrated significant progress in achieving  higher functional performance. However, the realization of stable pure-blue   $(\\approx\\!470\\:\\mathsf{n m}$   wavelength) PeLEDs with increased brightness and efficiency still  constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, a novel acid etching-driven ligand  exchange strategy is devised for achieving pure-blue emitting small-sized   $(\\approx\\!4\\:\\mathsf{n m})\\:\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with ultralow trap density  and excellent stability. The acid, hydrogen bromide (HBr), is employed to etch  imperfect  $[{\\sf P b B r}_{6}]^{4-}$   octahedron s, thereby removing surface defects and excessive  carboxyl ate ligands. Subsequently, dido dec yl amine and ph en ethyl amine are  successively introduced to bond the residual uncoordinated sites of the QDs and  attain in situ exchange with the original long-chain organic ligands, resulting  in near-unity quantum yield  $(97\\%)$   and remarkable stability. The QD-based  PeLEDs exhibit pure-blue electroluminescence at  $\\mathbf{470\\,nm}$   (corresponding to  the Commission Internationale del’Eclairage (CIE) (0.13, 0.11) coordinates),  an external quantum efficiency of  $4.7\\%$  , and a remarkable luminance of   $3850\\,\\mathtt{c d m}^{-2}$  , which is the highest brightness reported so far for pure-blue  PeLEDs. Furthermore, the PeLEDs exhibit robust durability, with a half-lifetime  exceeding  $\\mathbf{\\lambda\\left.\\rightleftharpoons}$   under continuous operation, representing a record performance  value for blue PeLEDs.  \n\nIn general, the strategies of component engineering and quantum confinement engineering have been utilized to  fabricate blue emitting per ovsk ites.  In  \n\nMetal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have  emerged as breakthrough emitters for high-definition displays,  due to their wide color gamut   $(\\approx\\!140\\%)$  , narrow full-width at  half-maximum (FWHM), facile and cost-effective solution process, and tunable emission peaks over the entire visible spectrum.  Recently, the state-of-the-art PeLEDs with green and  infrared emission demonstrated external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding   $20\\%;^{[2]}$   however, the pure red and blue  PeLEDs still suffer from severely inadequate brightness and  \n\nterms of component engineering, the mixed halide (Br and  Cl) per ovsk ites can sufficiently perform bandgap tailoring and  cover the entire blue spectra range.  The mixing of halides,  however, results in lattice mismatches and phase separation,  thereby undermining the performance of PeLEDs. Furthermore, Cl vacancies are easily formed in per ovsk ites due to their  low formation energy, inducing deeper defect level within the  bandgap in the process; this irreversibly captures charge carriers and dramatically suppresses the radiative recombination,  thus leading to the poor efficiency of PeLEDs.  Furthermore,  these defects can be considered as the hoping sites, which could  facilitate PeLEDs degradation by inducing halide ion migration,  these make the perovskite more susceptible to external stimulation under ambient and operational conditions.  \n\nSingle halide (Br) per ovsk ites, which are used to construct  small-sized quantum dots (QDs), such as   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   with a size  of   ${\\approx}4\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , exhibit pure-blue emission stemming from the  quantum confinement effect,  a characteristic which could  prevent the phase separation of PeLEDs and generation of Cl  vacancies. Their immense surface-to-volume ratio for smallsized QDs, however, still promotes the occurrence of a significant number of surface defects.  Although recent works  reported efficient blue PeLEDs based on low-dimension perovskites with EQEs over   $10\\%$  , they exhibited emission at   $480~\\mathrm{nm}$    or above, which is closer to sky-blue rather than pure bule.   An additional issue of these blue PeLEDs is their severely short  lifetime, spanning in the range of seconds or minutes.  \n\nHerein, we developed a novel strategy for achieving pureblue emitting small-sized   $(\\approx\\!4\\:\\mathrm{nm})$  )  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs with ultralow  vacancy defects and excellent environmental stability. Initially, the acid hydrogen bromide (HBr) was utilized to etch  imperfect octahedron s, thereby removing surface defects and  excessive carboxyl ate ligand from QDs and achieving accurate  coordination of   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$   ions. In this process, didodecylamine (DDDAM) and ph en ethyl amine (PEA) were successively introduced to bond the residual uncoordinated sites  and facilitate in situ exchange with the original long-chain  organic ligands on the QDs surface, achieving high-quality  and stable QDs with ultralow vacancy defects in the process.  Consequently, a near-unity photo luminescence quantum yield  (PLQY) of   $97\\%$   was attained, as well as remarkable stability  even in ultraviolet lighting and ambient conditions. The  PeLEDs fabricated by our all-solution process, combined with  the treated QDs, exhibited pure-blue emission at   $470\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , in  accordance with the Commission Internationale del’Eclairage  (CIE) (0.13, 0.11) coordinates (which meet the requirements  of Rec. 2020 display standards), an EQE of   $4.7\\%$  , a maximum  luminance of   $3850\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   (record performance value for pureblue PeLEDs), and long-term half-lifetime (above   $12\\mathrm{~h~}$  ) under  operational condition at the initial luminance of   $102\\ \\mathrm{cd}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  ,  which is more than one order of magnitude higher than the  state-of-the-art blue PeLEDs.  \n\nTo achieve pure-blue emission at   ${\\approx}470\\ \\mathrm{~nm}$  , the size  of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs should be reduced to   ${\\approx}4~\\mathrm{nm}$  , considering  the quantum confinement effect. This size was achieved for  the pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs via a hot-injection process with a  low injection temperature   $({\\approx}90\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  . Due to the slow growth  kinetics at low temperatures and the non stoic hio metric ratio of  cations to anions, the synthesis process was conducted under  halide-poor reaction conditions, in which the halide vacancies  were efficiently formed on the QDs surface.  Furthermore, the large surface-to-volume ratio\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
