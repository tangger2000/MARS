CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

The conductivity of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF is estimated to be   $4.26\\,\\times\\,10^{-3}\\,\\,\\mathrm{mS\\,\\,cm}^{-1}$  , higher than that of   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/}$  RbF   $(3.17\\times10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{mS\\;cm}^{-1})$  ) and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (  $(3.01\\times10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{mS\\;cm}^{-1})$  ). The  enhanced electron mobility and conductivity demonstrate the  more effective charge transport of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -RbF, which effectively  inhibits charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface  and improves the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   for PSCs.  The almost unchanged electron mobility of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   compared with   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  demonstrates  that the surface modification by RbF will not change the electrical properties of ETLs. The increased electron mobility of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RbF could be attributed to the strong bonding between F  and Sn observed in XPS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to illustrate the properties of the atomic  structures and the interaction between   $\\mathrm{F}$   and   $\\mathrm{Sn}$  . Generally,   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   crystallizes to form a rutile structure, and the (110) plane  is the energetically the most favorable surface, which is composed of flat   $\\mathrm{Sn-O}$   planes connected by O atoms.  As shown  in  Figures   2 a and 2b, we placed a   $1\\times1$   unit cell RbF on the top  of a  $1\\times1$   unit cell   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   (110) slab with a   $3\\times3$   unit to construct  the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RbF structure. The adsorption energy of   $\\mathrm{F}$  on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   (110) surface is  $-2.35\\,\\mathrm{eV}$     $(-106.2\\,\\mathrm{meV}\\,\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}^{-2})$  , demonstrating  the intense interaction between   $\\mathrm{F}$   and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (110).  We speculated that the strong interaction between F and Sn likely originates from the newly formed   $_{\\mathrm{F-Sn}}$   bonds, which may be one  of the main reasons for the changes in the electrical properties  of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  . In addition, a negligible interaction between Rb and \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (110) is found due to a relatively low adsorption energy \n\n  $-0.48~\\mathrm{eV}$     $\\dot{(-21.7\\,\\mathrm{meV}\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-2})}$   of Rb on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   (110) surface.  \n\nAfterwards, we prepared the perovskite films through a twostep method to study the influence of the ETLs on the perovskite films. What needs to be emphasized is that the mixed  solvents   $(\\mathrm{DMSO\\,+\\,DMF}$  ) do not dissolve the RbF. To investigate the effect of the RbF on the interface between the ETL  and the perovskite, we performed DFT calculations to evaluate  the change in binding energy at the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (110)/  $'\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   (110)  interface. The   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   (110) lattice plane is the energetically  favorable orientation in film crystallization.

The calculation's results  reveal that the RbF modification leads to a stronger bonding  between the ETL and perovskite with a binding energy of  $-5.54$    and   $-4.38~\\mathrm{eV}$   per   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   (110) unit respectively for the interface  with and without the RbF interlayer. Note that the DFT calculations for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   (110)/  $\\mathrm{{'}F A P b I_{3}}$   (110) interface gave similar  results of the binding energy.   $(-5.59$   and   $-4.61\\,\\mathrm{eV}$   for the interface with and without the RbF, respectively) It demonstrates  that the introduction of RbF energetically helps   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   contact  the perovskite and hence significantly improves the affiliation  of the interfaces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images  are shown in  Figure   3 a–c, and RbF modification seems to have  no effect on the perovskite films' surface morph o logie s. All the  perovskite films are uniform and full-coverage with similar  grain sizes. And we observed that the perovskite film based on  the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}.R b F}$   is smoother than the others. In order to verify  this phenomenon, AFM measurements were operated to investigate the surface roughness of perovskite films. Figure  S10,  Supporting Information, shows that the perovskite film based  on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF owns the lowest RMS of  .1  nm, which is  consistent with the SEM observation. X-ray diffraction (XRD)  was conducted to explore the effect of different ETLs on the  perovskite crystallization. As shown in Figure  3d, the characteristic diffraction peaks of all the perovskite films are almost  the same, along with a similar peak intensity. Note that the diffraction peak at   $12.7^{\\circ}$   with a strong peak intensity should be  assigned to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , and these moderate residues of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   could  passivate the surface or grain boundary defects of perovskite  films.  \n\nIn order to explore whether RbF penetrates into the perovskite, time-of-flight secondary ions mass spectroscopy (ToFSIMS) was\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
