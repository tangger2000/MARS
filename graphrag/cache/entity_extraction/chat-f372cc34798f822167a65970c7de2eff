CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

On the other hand, rGO  has high tolerance to strong acid so it is stable as the   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   evolution active site during the photo catalytic process.  \n\nTo explore the role of rGO in the photo catalytic   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   evolution of   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$  , we measure the photo luminescence (PL)  decay kinetics and PL spectra. The PL decay curves of  Figure   4 a  were fitted by using the model of two exponential functions.  The resulting parameters listed in Table S2 (Supporting Information) show that the average lifetime is shorter for   $\\mathrm{\\small{MA}\\mathrm{bl}_{3}/}$  rGO than for   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   (157.81 vs 342.32 ps. The associated  parameters are listed in Table S2 (Supporting Information)).  This indicates a more rapid charge transfer and a more efficient electron-hole separation in  $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}/\\mathrm{rGC}$  . In addition, the  drastic decrease in the PL intensity of   $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{MAPbl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rGC}$   compared  with that of   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   (Figure 4b) indicates that photo generated  electrons in the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   are efficiently transferred to the rGO,  and a charge recombination is diminished, reducing the PL  intensity and elevating the  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   evolution rate. It is of interest to  discuss a probable reason why the  $\\mathrm{Pb{-}O{-}C}$   bonds between the  rGO and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   units help efficiently separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. As depicted in  Figure   5 a, electron– hole pairs are generated in the   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{3}$   framework of   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$  .  The valence band maximum (VBM) of this framework has the  character of sigma antibonding between the Pb 6s and   $\\mathrm{~I~}\\,5\\mathrm{p}$  orbitals (Figure 5b), but the conduction band minimum (CBM)  of the framework that of pi antibonding between the Pb 6p and   $\\mathrm{~I~}5\\mathrm{p}$   orbitals (Figure 5c). Thus, the   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{O}$   bond of a   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}O{-}C}$    bridge is described by the   $\\mathrm{Pb~6p-O~2p~}$   overlap (Figure 5c) in  the energy region of the CBM, but by the   $\\mathrm{Pb~6s-O~2p}$   overlap \n\n (Figure 5b) in the energy region of the VBM. Since the Pb \n\n  $\\mathsf{6p\\mathrm{~-~O~}2p}$   overlap is stronger than the   $\\mathrm{Pb~6s~-~O~2p~}$   overlap,  the transfer of photo generated charge carriers to the rGO unit  through the   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}O{-}C}$   bridge would be faster for the electrons  around the CBM than for the holes around the VBM.  \n\nElectro chemiluminescence (ECL) can be used to investigate  the electron transfer and the nature of a lumi no ph ore under  various electrochemical conditions.  Charge transfer between  nano crystals with positive and negative charge states can produce ECL.  Compared with bare glassy carbon electrode \n\n (GCE), the cyclic voltammetry curves of GCE modified with \n\n  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$     $(\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}|\\mathrm{GCE})$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$     $\\mathrm{(MAPbI_{3}/r G O\\vert G C E)}$  display a strong anodic process (Figure S9, Supporting Information), which indicates that   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   could  be electro chemically oxidized to positive charge states by  removing electrons from the VBM.  Thus, when injected into  the CBM of these materials, the electrons recombine radiative ly  with the holes in the VBM, so that ECL occurs immediately,  just as shown in Figure 4c. Obvious ECL is observed upon  stepping   $\\mathrm{\\MAPbI}_{3}\\vert\\mathrm{GCE}$   and   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}/\\mathrm{rGC}\\vert\\mathrm{GCE}$   from   $+1.5$   V  to   $-0.6\\,\\mathrm{~V},$  , indicating that radiative charge transfer occurs by  reducing the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   of oxidative state. The  step ECL intensity of   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/r G O\\vert G C E}$   is stronger than that of   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}\\vert G C E}$  . Two factors are responsible for this observation.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/d3d5d533206ad624866ff350e8372f11d6e724045dbd3e80634f042f7280b092-1723832682.jpg)  \nFigure 5.   a) Schematic view of the atom arrangement around the   $\\mathsf{P b}$   site of a   $\\mathsf{P b\\mathrm{-}O\\mathrm{-}C}$   bridge between rGO and   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$  . The   $\\mathsf{P b}$   site is most likely  surrounded by one O and five I atoms, but only the   $\\bigcirc$   and two of the five I atoms are shown for simplicity. The rGO unit is not shown for the same  reason. b,c) The orbital characters around the   $\\mathsf{P b}$   site of a  $\\mathsf{P b\\mathrm{-}O\\mathrm{-}C}$   bridge in the energy region of the VBM (b) and CBM (c).  \n\nFirst, the electron injection into   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$   occurs preferentially in the rGO part because the latter has a higher electrical conductivity than does the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   part. Second, the  electrons injected into the rGO are quickly transferred to the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   part through the   $\\mathrm{Pb{-}O{-}C}$   bridges thereby reaching  the CBM of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and subsequently recombining with  the holes created in the VBM of the   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$  . Figure 4c shows  that every oxidation step   $_{(+1.5\\mathrm{~V~}}$   for 1 s) of the samples is followed by a step of electron injection   $(-0.6\\mathrm{~V~}$  for 1 s), resulting  in ECL. Thus when more electrons are accessible for injection,  the recombination occurs more effectively, and a stronger ECL  is detected. This matter is also confirmed by electrochemical  impendence spectra (EIS), which is an effective way to probe  the PEC performances. To investigate the charge transfer properties of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}/\\mathrm{rG O}}$  , the corresponding photoelectrodes were assembled, and EIS analyses were conducted in  dichloromethane solution. As shown in Figure 4d, the Nyquist  plots indicate that the charge transfer resistance of   $\\\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
