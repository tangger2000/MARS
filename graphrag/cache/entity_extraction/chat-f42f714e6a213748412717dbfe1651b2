CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The saturated   $\\mathsf{A g}|\\mathsf{A g C}|$  , graphite rod and perovskite/Ni  foam served as the reference electrode, counter electrodes and working  electrode, respectively. OER polarization curves gained from linear  sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded at a scan rate of   $5\\,\\textrm{\\textmu\\textmu\\textmu}\\,{\\sf s}^{-1}$  from 0.2 to   $0.9\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus   $\\mathsf{A g}|\\mathsf{A g C}|$  , and HER polarization curves was  recorded from   $-1.1$   to   $-2.1\\ \\lor$   versus   $\\mathsf{A g}|\\mathsf{A g C}|$   corrected by iR corrected.  Tafel slopes were measured by replotting the polarization curves that  over potential   $(\\eta)$   versus the logarithm of current density (log  | J | ). The  durability of OER performance was tested at  $0.53~\\lor$   versus Ag | AgCl (for  OER). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was applied to assess the  electrochemical double-layer capacitance   $(\\mathsf C_{\\mathsf{d}1})$   for OER from   $-0.5\\ \\lor$  to   $-0.3\\ \\lor.$   The   ${\\mathsf{C}}_{\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{I}}$   was derived by the slopes of the halves of charging  current density difference at the center of the scanning potential range  versus scan rates.

The solar flux was controlled  to   $100\\,\\,{\\sf m W}\\,\\,{\\sf c m}^{-2}$  , and the mass changes of water were recorded by a  high-accuracy balance. The per ovsk ites/NF composites were floated on  the water under light irradiation. Meanwhile, the surface temperature  distribution of catalysts and water was monitored by an infrared  thermal imager (E8, FLIR). The ambient temperature and humidity were  maintained at  $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  and  $\\approx\\!50\\%$   RH, respectively.  \n\nMaterials Characterization : XRD diffract o meter (Ultima IV, Rigaku)  was used to obtain the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for  crystallographic identification, which was operated at   $40\\;\\mathrm{~\\textperthousand~}$  and   $30~\\mathsf{m A}$  with   $\\mathsf{C u}\\ \\mathsf{K}\\alpha$   radiation. Combined with the Rietveld refinements  using GSAS software, more detailed information on the crystalline  structure was analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy measurements  were performed with a field emission scanning electron microscopy  (SEM, JEOL JSM-7600F). For further investigation of the morphology  and elemental identification, high-resolution transmission electron  microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) with an accelerating voltage of   $200~\\mathrm{kV}$  was employed. The wet t ability property of the composite surface  was characterized using a contact angle meter (KRUSS, DSA100). The  surface chemical states of catalysts before and after electro catalysis were  investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi,  Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with  $\\mathsf{A l{-K}\\alpha}$  radiation and data were  fitted by the XPSPEAK software. The solar absorption   $(\\alpha)$   properties of  the catalysts were determined by the diffuse reflection ( R ) spectra using  a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PE). The absorptivity  was calculated by the equation   $\\alpha={\\mid-R={\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{300}^{2500}\\!I(\\lambda)({\\mid}-R(\\lambda))}{\\displaystyle\\int_{300}^{2500}\\!I(\\lambda)d\\lambda}}}$  ,  where   $\\lambda$   is the wavelength.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nY.L., H.Z., Y.W., and X.Z. contributed equally to this work.
