This special  hybrid structure with intimate contact and uniformly dispersion  of non precious metal alloys on heteroatom-doped carbon fibers  might be favorable for achieving excellent electro catalytic performances for the ORR and OER processes as oxygen catalysts.  \n\nIn order to evaluate the ORR/OER catalytic activities, the  four catalysts were first loaded onto glassy carbon electrodes for  cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in   $\\mathrm{N}_{2}.$  - or   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated   $0.1~\\mathrm{~M~}$  KOH solution at room temperature without rotation,  respectively.  And the scan rates are all   $50\\;\\mathrm{mV}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  . As shown  in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, the four as-prepared materials exhibit no reduction peak in   $\\Nu_{2}$  -saturated KOH  solution, while a distinct reduction peak appeared in   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated KOH solution, which could be attributed to the reduction of   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  . Among the four materials, the   $\\mathrm{NIC}{\\omega}\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}{\\ }2$   shows  apparently the most outstanding catalytic activity for oxygen  reduction, characterized with the most positive onset and peak  potential (see the vertical dashed line), which could be attributed to the suitable loading amount of NiCo alloy nanoparticles, excellent morphology, and novel structure of the hybrid   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}2$   (see SEM and TEM images).  \n\nTo further investigate and compare the catalytic performances of the four synthesized materials, linear sweeping voltammograms (LSVs) were measured in  $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -saturated  $0.1\\ \\mathrm{M\\KOH}$    at a rotating speed of   $1600\\,\\mathrm{\\rpm}$   on rotating disk electrode  from 0.06 to   $0.96~\\mathrm{V}$   (vs RHE: Reversible Hydrogen Electrode)  with the scan rates of   $10\\:\\mathrm{\\mV~\\s^{-1}}$   to reveal the ORR catalytic performance, and the results are exhibited in  Figure   3 a.  The ORR activity of the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   (  $20\\;\\mathrm{\\wt\\%}$   Pt on  Vulcan XC-72, Johnson Matthey) was also measured and  included for better comparison under the same condition.  From Figure 3a, we could see that the limited current density  of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   could not reach to   $-3\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$  , while the others are  higher than   $-3\\:\\mathrm{\\mA{~}}\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  tials of the NiCo  $\\mathrm{\\Omega}.\\mathrm{\\Omega}@\\mathrm{N}.\\mathrm{C}$   1, N  $\\mathrm{i}\\mathrm{Co@N.C~}\\,2$  , and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}\\,3$    are 0.72, 0.81, and   $0.76\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   (vs RHE) at the current density of   $-3\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  .  The   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   exhibits the most positive  potential among the four synthesized materials, which is even   $10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$   positive than that of the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   (  $0.80\\,\\mathrm{V}$   vs RHE)  at the same current density. More remarkably, the diffusion  limited current densities of N îƒ† C, NiC  $\\supset@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\ 1$  , NiCo@N-C 2,  and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}3$   are  âˆ’ 2.43,   $-4.92$  ,  $-6.54$  , and   $-5.12~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2},$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/c75428c3005d842cb618fbc94caaf5f52608c86ebeed8765e7288ec012a8af3b-1727077628.jpg)  \nFigure 2. â€‚ a) TEM, b) HRTEM, and c) elemental mapping images of NiCo@N-C 2.  \n\nrespectively.   $\\mathrm{NeCo@N.C}$   2 shows the unexpected, highest  limited current density, which is even higher than that of the  commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$     $(-5.8\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}})$  ). All the above indicated that  NiCo  $\\mathrm{\\bulletN.C}$   2 possesses the best ORR electro catalytic activity.  The electro catalytic activity could be also evaluated from Tafel  slope  and the results are shown in Figure 3b. The Tafel slopes  at low over-potential are  âˆ’ 184,  âˆ’ 135,   $-65$  , and   $-120\\ \\mathrm{mV}$   dec âˆ’ 1 for   $\\mathrm{N{-}C}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$   1,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$  2, and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$  3,  respectively.   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   displays the smallest slope among  the four catalysts, which even approaches to that of the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$     $(-62\\:\\mathrm{mV}\\:\\mathrm{dec}^{-1})$  .  \n\nThe OER activities of the four synthesized samples with the  commercial   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   catalyst were also evaluated, and the results  are shown in Figure 3c. At the current density of   $10\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , the corresponding potential of the   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$  2,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N\\!\\cdot\\!C}$  3, and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   are 1.76, 1.78, and   $1.76~\\mathrm{V}$   (vs RHE), respectively.  While the current density of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$  1 could  not reach to   $10\\mathrm{\\mA\\cm^{-2}}$   even at the maximum potential. In  addition, the maximum current densities of   $\\mathrm{N{-}C}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C}$  1, NiCo  $@\\mathrm{N.C}$   2, NiCo  $@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~;$  3, and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   at 1.96 V (vs RHE)  are 2.60, 6.67, 16.80, 14.66, and   $15.9\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}^{-2}}$  , respectively.   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}2$   shows the most excellent OER activity, even comparable to the commercial   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   catalyst. The corresponding  Tafel plots of OER process for the various catalysts are shown  in Figure 3d. The Tafel slopes at low over-potential are 175, 143,  98, 100, and   $99~\\mathrm{mV}$   dec âˆ’ 1  for   $\\mathrm{N{-}C}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~1$  , NiCo  $@\\mathrm{N.C}$  2,  $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}3$  , and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$  , respectively.   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   exhibits  the smallest slope among the four synthesized catalysts as well,  which is even approximately close to that of the commercial   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   catalyst.  \n\nIn addition, the double-layer capacitance (  $\\left(C_{\\mathrm{DL}}\\right)$   and electrochemically active surface area (E\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
