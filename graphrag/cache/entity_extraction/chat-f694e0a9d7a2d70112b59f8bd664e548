Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

[8])  to reduce electronic dimension is a useful  method.  However, doping also tends to  cause non radiation recombination loss.   Therefore, a reliable and promising way is  to synthesize high-quality inorganic metal  halide single crystal (SC) with natural lowdimensional structure to realize stable and  high quantum efficiency white-light illumination application.  \n\nEnergy-saving white lighting from the efficient intrinsic emission of  semiconductors is considered as a next-generation lighting source. Currently,  white-light emission can be composited with a blue light-emitting diode and  yellow phosphor. However, this solution has an inevitable light loss, which  makes the improvement of the energy utilization efficiency more difficult. To  deal with this problem, intrinsic white-light emission (IWE) in a single solid  material gives a possibility. Here, an all-inorganic lead-free  $\\mathsf{c s c u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{3}$   perovskite  single crystal (SC) with stable and high photo luminescence quantum yield   $(\\approx\\!15.7\\%)$   IWE through strongly localized 1D exciton recombination is  synthesized. In the  $\\mathsf{c s c u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{3}$  , the  $\\mathsf{c u-l}$   octahedron, which provides most of  electron states, is isolated by Cs atoms in two directions to form a 1D electronic  structure, resulting a high radiation recombination rate of excitons. With this  electronic structure design, the   $\\mathsf{c s c u}_{2}\\mathsf{I}_{3}$   SCs have great potential in energysaving white lighting.  \n\nIn this work, we successfully synthesized  1D   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC by replacing toxic   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   with  eco-friendly and abundant   $\\mathrm{Cu}$  , and organic  molecules with large-radius Cs.  The  “one dimension ” we noted here is localized  dimension of electron.  Through density  functional theory (DFT) calculation, in 1D   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC,   $[\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}]^{-}$   octahedra contributes  \n\nIntrinsic white-light emission (IWE) in single solid material,  compared with that in phosphor, has more excellent color rendering and efficient energy utilization, and plays an important  role in energy-saving lighting.  Recently, the IWE has achieved  great effects in low-dimensional (1D/2D) organic–inorganic  lead halides.  However, the problem of thermal instability  and toxicity caused by organic composition and heavy   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   is  hard to get solved.  Based on this circumstance, all-inorganic  lead-free metal halides possess more prominent prospect in a  stable, efficient, and eco-friendly white lighting.  \n\nmost electronic states, and   $C s^{+}$   only forms a 1D electronic structure with isolated  $[\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}]^{-}$   in 2D direction. Therefore,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC  obtains a high photo luminescence quantum yield   $(\\mathrm{PLQY}\\!\\approx\\!\\!15.7\\%)$    of the IWE at room temperature.  We also calculated that the  crystal has a high radiation recombination rate which is owning to  the 1D localized electronic structure, and this rate is the key to its  high PLQY.  Under a strong injection and atmospheric environment, the PL intensity of all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC only decays  about  $5\\%$   after  $750\\,\\mathrm{min}$   (Figure S5, Supporting Information). This  excellent stability demonstrates that the all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC  possesses a great prospect in high-efficiency lighting applications.  \n\nIn the past, all-inorganic lead-free metal halides   $(\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6})$  )  with double perovskite structure emit bright broadband warm  white light through self-trapped exciton recombination.   Based on this mechanism, the radiation recombination rate, to  a large extent, depends on the localized degree of excitons.  \n\nHigh-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SCs were synthesized by anti solvent  infiltration method.  Cesium iodide and cuprous (I) iodide  in certain ratio were dissolved in dimethyl formamide (DMF)- dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1) to obtain a saturated solution.  Then, methanol (anti solvent) was slowly dropped into the saturated solution to form a white precipitate (the white precipitate  quickly dissolved again) until it no longer dissolved. The solution was filtered and then placed in a beaker with methanol  atmosphere to grow crystals. Several days later, centimeter-scale  high-quality  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SCs were obtained (refer to the Supporting  information and the Experimental Section for more details).  \n\nFigure   1 a shows an optical image of a rod-shaped   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$    SCs excited by ultraviolet light. The SC has a size of about   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mm}\\,\\times\\,1.5\\,\\mathrm{\\m}$  mm, being colorless and transparent at room  temperature but having strong white-light emission under  ultraviolet light. Crystal structure of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC was  obtained through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) test  (Figure 1b,c), which belongs to ortho rhombi c system.

This unique core–shell structure results in a strong 1D localized electronic distribution.  In metal halides, this unique  octahedral structure with Cu as the core may cause a distinct  Jahn–Teller effect.  The electrons are reconfigured to form  self-trapped excitons which usually emit broadband spectrum.  In the electron diffraction pattern (Figure 1d), the crystal structure of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Cu}_{2}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   SC is confirmed to be an ortho rhombi c system,  which is consistent with the results of SCXRD.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; Figure 1e) shows that the defect-free  crystal has a complete crystal lattice.
