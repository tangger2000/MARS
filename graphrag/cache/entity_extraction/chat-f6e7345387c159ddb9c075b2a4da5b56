CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Our certificated efficiency is the highest for low  temperature processed perovskite reported so far, the comparison with previous reports could be found in Table S4 (Supporting Information).  \n\nIt must be noted that our devices showed almost free of hysteresis when we measured internally, while testing at Newport,  a noticeable hysteresis was observed. This might be due to the  degradation of perovskite layer during shipping, while excess of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   has been formed. As shown in Figure 3a, the hysteresis is  very sensitive to the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   amount. Similar hysteresis enlargement was also observed while the devices were degraded in  ambient air.  \n\nWe also fabricate large area devices   $(1\\,\\mathrm{\\cm^{2}})$   based on the  optimized conditions shown above, a   $20.1\\%$   power conversion  efficiency was obtained (Figure 5b), and the external quantum  efficiency was shown in Figure S7b (Supporting Information).  Compared with the small size devices, only FF was dropped a little  bit, this could be due to the poor lateral transport of our indium  \n\ntin oxide (ITO) electrode, which should be improved in the future. In summary, we adopted two-step method to finely control the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   content in the planar-structure perovskite solar cells, and  we found that the moderate residual of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   could deliver stable  and high efficiency of solar cells, while too much residual   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$    could lead to serious hysteresis and also poor stability. According  to finely tuned the residual   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   in perovskite layer, we have  achieved   $21.6\\%$   power conversion efficiency in small size   $(0.0737\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   and  $20.1\\%$   in large size   $(1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$  , and a   $20.9\\%$   certificated efficiency in small size was obtained, which is the highest  in planar structure of perovskite solar cells. We believe that more  efficient and stable planar-structure perovskite can be obtained  by surface/bulk pass iv ation  and interface engineering.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : The   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   colloid precursor was obtained from Alfa Aesar  (tin (IV) oxide).   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$  ,  N , N -dimethyl form amide (DMF), and dimethyl  sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Form amid in i um  iodide (FAI), methyl ammonium bromide (MABr), and methyl ammonium  chloride (MACl) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology  Corp.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : ITO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing  with detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and iso prop an ol (IPA).  Before using, the ITO was cleaned by UVO for   $10\\:\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . Then, the  substrate was spin coated with a thin layer of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   nano particle film   $(2.67\\%)$   at 4000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  , and annealed in ambient air at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for 30 min. After that,   $1.3~\\mathrm{~M~}$   of   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   in   $(\\mathsf{D M F};\\mathsf{D M S O}\\,=\\,9.5;0.5)$  ) was  spin coated onto   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   at 1500 rpm for   $30\\,\\mathrm{~s~}_{!}$  , and then annealed at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $1\\ m i n$  , after   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   had cooled down to room temperature, the  mixture solution of FAI:MABr:MACl (60 mg:6 mg:6 mg in   $1~\\mathsf{m L}$   IPA)  was spin coated onto the   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   at different spin rate ranging from 1000  to 1700  rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$  , and a thermal annealing of   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for 15 min  in ambient air condition (  $(30{-}40\\%$   humidity) was processed. The hole  transporting layer was deposited on top of the perovskite layer by   $3000\\;\\mathsf{r p m}$   for  $30~\\mathrm{s}$   using   ${}^{2,2^{\\prime},7,7^{\\prime}}$  -tetrakis( N , N -dip-meth oxy phenyl amine)- 9,9 ′ -spiro bif luo rene (Spiro-OMeTAD) solution, which consisted of   $72.3\\ \\mathrm{\\textmu m g}$   Spiro-OMeTAD,   $35\\ \\ \\upmu L$   bis(tri flu oro methane) s ulf on imi de  lithium salt (Li-TFSI) stock solution (  $.260\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{g}$   Li-TFSI in 1 mL  acetonitrile),   $30~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   4-tert but yl pyr i dine, and  $\\mathsf{I}~\\mathsf{m L}$   chl oro benzene. Finally,   $80~\\mathsf{n m}$   of Au film was thermal evaporated as a counter electrode using  a shadow mask. The small device size areas were   $0.108\\ {\\mathsf{c m}}^{2}$  , and the  large device size was   $1.21~\\mathsf{c m}^{2}$  . While measuring, a 0.0737 and   $\\mathsf{I}\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{2}$    non reflective mask was used to define the accurate active cell area for  small and large size, respectively.  \n\nMaterials and Devices Characterization : The SEM images were  acquired by using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI  NanoSEM650), using an electron beam accelerated at   $500~\\lor$  to   $30~\\mathrm{kV},$    enabling operation at a variety of currents. The X-ray diffraction patterns  of the perovskite thin films (2 θ  scans) were performed on a Rigaku   $\\mathsf{D}/$  MAX-2500 system using   ${\\mathsf{C u}}~\\mathsf{K}_{\\alpha}$  radiation   $(\\lambda=1.5405~\\AA)$   as the X-ray  source. Scans were taken with   $0.5\\ \\mathsf{m m}$   wide source and detector slits,  with X-ray generator settings at   $40~\\mathrm{kV}$   and   $30\\ \\mathsf{m A}.$   Absorption spectra  were carried out by an UV–vis spectrometer (Cary 5000). Steady state  PL was measured by FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh, England). Timeresolved PL spectra were measured by F900 spectrometer (Edinburgh,  England). The  $J^{-V}$  characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were obtained  using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under simulated one-sun AM 1.5G  illumination (  $.100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\ c m^{-2})$   with a solar simulator (Enli Tech, Taiwan),  and the light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 Si diode. The   $J^{-V}$  measurements were carried out in ambient air. The devices were  measured both in reverse scan (  $\\uparrow.2\\lor\\rightarrow0\\lor,$   step   $0.02~\\lor$  ) and forward  scan   $(0\\ \\vee\\rightarrow].2\\ \\vee,$   step 0.02 V). The EQE was measured using an Enli  Tech (Taiwan) EQE measurement system. We sent our best devices to  an accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was supported by National Key Research and Development  Program of China (grant no. 2016YFB0700700, 2017YFA0206600),  National Science Foundation\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
