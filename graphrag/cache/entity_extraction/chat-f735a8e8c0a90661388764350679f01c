CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

On the other hand, the high conductivity of  the carbon fibers support could enhance the electron transfer  for the NiCo alloy nano particle, alleviate the aggregation of  the nanoparticles and accelerate the ions transport during  ORR and OER processes. The ORR process stability was  measured in   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   -saturated   $0.1\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$   KOH at half-wave potential  under a rotating rates of   $1600~\\mathrm{rpm}$   for   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and NiCo  $_{\\mathrm{{'@N.C}}}$    2, and the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   has also been tested under the  same condition for better comparison, the results are shown  in  Figure   5 a. After   $^{\\mathrm{~7~h~}}$  continuous operation,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N.C~}2$    exhibits the best ORR long-term stability and the plot of stability is nearly a straight line, which is superior to   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and  the commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   catalyst. The residual current percentages of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$  , NiC  $\\mathsf{o}\\!\\left(\\varnothing\\mathrm{N}\\!\\!\\cdot\\!\\!\\mathsf{C}\\;2\\right)$  , and commercial   $\\mathrm{Pt}/\\mathrm{C}$   are   $81.2\\%$  ,   $90.4\\%$  , and   $53.4\\%$  , respectively. Furthermore, long-term  st abilities of OER process for   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NiC}o@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\,2$  , and the com  mercial   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   were also tested at   $1.71~\\mathrm{V}$   (vs RHE) in   $\\Nu_{2}$  -saturated   $0.1\\ \\mathrm{M\\KOH}$   under a rotating rates of   $1600~\\mathrm{rpm}$  , and the  results are displayed in Figure 5b. After   $7\\mathrm{~h~}$   continuous measurement, the current of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}\\hat{\\lambda}$  2 still keeps at around \n\n  $2.57\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}$  , which is much larger than the current of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   \n\n  $(0.34~\\mathrm{mA})$   and   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$     $(2.33\\mathrm{~mA})$  ). The residual current percentages of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$  ,   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$  , and commercial   $\\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$   are   $64.1\\%$  ,   $79.5\\%$  , and   $75.0\\%$  , respectively. Again,   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N\\!\\cdot\\!C}\\ \\}$  2 displays  the best OER stability. In addition, after  $7\\mathrm{~h~}$  continuous operation, we collected the samples on the glassy carbon electrode  both after ORR and OER bulk electrolysis (BE) processes, and  characterized with SEM, respectively. The SEM images of   $\\mathrm{NiC}o@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\;2$   after 7 h testing for ORR and OER st abilities are  shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. After   $7\\mathrm{~h~}$    BE testing for ORR and OER processes, the morphology and  structure of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$   have almost no change. For ORR  BE, after 7 h testing, NiCo alloy nanoparticles are still decorated on the N-doped carbon nanofibers uniformly and the  diameter is also about   $50~\\mathrm{nm}$   as before. Meanwhile, N-doped  carbon nanofibers (  $({\\approx}100\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   in diameter as before) are still  continuous and separated well from each other. In addition,  there is no aggregation both for NiCo alloy nanoparticles and  carbon nanofibers. On the other hand, for the OER BE, the  morphology and structure of the   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$   have not been  changed a lot similarly. In conclusion, all of these above imply  that the sample   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}2$   exhibits outstanding st abilities  in   $0.1\\,\\mathrm{~M~}$   KOH solution for both ORR and OER processes and  the stability of carbon materials on both ORR and OER processes could be enhanced greatly, after decorated with suitable  amount of NiCo alloy nanoparticles.  \n\nThe outstanding ORR and OER electrochemical performances of   $\\mathrm{NiCo@N-C~}\\hat{\\lambda}$   motivated us to investigate its feasibility as the air catalyst of primary zinc–air batteries.

The nyquist plots and the simulated elemental values  are shown in Figure S7 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information, respectively. The impend en ces of the solution   $\\{0.1\\mathrm{~M~}$   KOH)  are similar in each measurement, which are all around   $50~\\Omega$  .  The intrinsic resistance (  $R_{\\mathrm{f}},$   Table S1, Supporting Information)  of the catalysts decreases rapidly with the increasing of the  alloy nanoparticles mass loading, and   $\\mathrm{NIC}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   shows the  smallest catalyst resistance   $(6.9\\,\\,\\,\\Omega)$  . Furthermore, the charge  transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$   of   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}~2$   is also the smallest  one   $\\left(11.3\\ \\Omega\\right)$  , while   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   exhibits the largest charge transfer  resistance   $(438.0\\ \\Omega)$  . The both smallest catalyst resistance and  charge transfer resistance of NiCo  $@\\mathrm{N.C}$   2 may result from  its excellent morphology (moderate NiCo alloy nanoparticles  decorated on N-doped carbon nanofibers), nitrogen doping, and  synergistic effect between NiCo alloy nanoparticles and carbon  nanofibers. The significantly reduced intrinsic resistance and  charge transfer resistance of the hybrid catalysts are beneficial  to the enhanced OER activities and in good agreement with the  results in Figure 3c.  \n\nThe surface compositions of   $_\\mathrm{N-C}$   and   $\\mathrm{NICo}@\\mathrm{N}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{C}\\ \\,{\\gimel}$   are  further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  to get insightful chemical and structural information.
