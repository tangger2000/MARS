OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Three regions can be identified based on the slope   $(n)$   of the curve:   $n=1$   is the Ohmic region,  $n=2$   is the SCLC region  (child), and  $n>3$   is the trap-filled limited region (TFL). c) Steady-state photo luminescence spectrums and d) time-resolved PL decays for the  $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{C s P bI}_{3}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{O T G}3$   films. The asterisks indicate the presence of  $\\mathsf{P b}^{0}$   components. The samples for PL measurement were deposited on bare glass substrates.  \n\nPL plot of the corresponding perovskite samples. The PL decay  curves were fitted with a double exponential equation, and the  parameters derived from the curves are summarized in Table S1  (Supporting Information). The results showed that the fast  decay lifetime   $(\\tau_{1})$   that accounts for bio molecular recombination of photo generated free carriers was not obviously changed,  but the slow decay lifetime   $(\\tau_{2})$   relative to the trap-assisted  recombination exhibited a much higher value (81.7 ns) for the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   perovskite than for pristine   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   (47.4  ns).  This enhanced PL lifetime suggests that there was less nonradiative recombination and a lower trap density in the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3^{-}}$  OTG3 perovskite films.  \n\nTo further study the effect of surface organic terminal groups  on the photovoltaic performance of the device, we fabricated  perovskite solar cells with an inverted planar structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass/PTAA/  $\\mathsf{\\check{C}s P b I_{3}}$   perovskite  (without or with OTG molecules)/PCBM/BCP/Ag ( Figure    5 a).  Table S2 and Figure S12 (Supporting Information) list the statistic distribution of corresponding photovoltaic parameters   $(J_{\\mathrm{sc}},\\ \\ V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   FF, and PCE) of the devices with different molar  ratios of OTG3 to   $\\mathrm{HPIbI}_{3}$   in the precursor solution (12 devices  in a batch), and the characteristic   $J{-}V$  curves are plotted in  Figure S13 (Supporting Information). As the OTG3 molar ratio  was increased from   $0.1\\%$   to   $1\\%$  , the PCE first increased and  then decreased. The best cell efficiency occurred at a molar ratio  of   $0.2\\%$  . Figure  5b shows the   $J{-}V$  curves of the best devices  based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   perovskite. The control  devices gave a   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.07\\mathrm{~V},$   a  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $15.85\\ \\mathrm{mA\\cm}^{-2}$  , a fill factor  (FF) of   $68.52\\%$  , and a PCE of   $11.62\\%$  . The performance of the  PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   was an enormous improvement  over the performance of the control device; the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   was   $1.12~\\mathrm{V},$  the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   was   $15.81\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , the FF was   $75.19\\%$  , and the PCE was   $13.32\\%$  . To increase the accuracy of photovoltaic measurement,  we perform the hysteresis analysis of PSCs based on different  scan directions (Figure S14, Supporting Information), both the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   devices show a negligible hysteresis  between forward and reverse scan. The cross-section SEM image  of the optimized   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{3}\\mathrm{-OTG}3$   device is shown in Figure S15  (Supporting Information). We attributed the enhancements  of the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and FF of the CsPbI 3 –OTG3 PSCs to the efficient  pass iv ation of surface electronic trap states caused by the  under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   defects, which effectively reduced the  energy loss due to non radiative recombination of the charge  carrier.  \n\nTo ensure the reliability of the performance of the device,  we measured the steady-state PCE for about 600 s under a constant bias of   $0.88~\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
