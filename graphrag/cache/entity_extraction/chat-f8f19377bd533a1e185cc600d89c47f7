CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

Long alkyl chain ligands are beneficial for QD dispersion in  solutions, but they lead to delays in carrier injection/transport  due to the increased distance between QDs and act as insulating layers. Exchanging a long chain ligand (OA, C18) for a  short alkyl chain ligand (1-octane thi ol, C8) is a known method  to improve the electrical properties of QDs. The shorter-ligand  QDs enhance the hole and electron transfer in the QD layers,  resulting in low turn-on voltage and high efficiency of the  resulting QLEDs.  Conventional long OA ligands have also  been exchanged for short alkyl chains and strongly binding  tris(mer cap to methyl)nonane (TMMN) ligands having three  thiol groups.  The use of TMMN ligands enhanced the QD  stability and improved charge injection/transport, resulting in  a device with a half-life time of   $301\\textrm{h}$   at an initial luminance  of   $4000\\ \\textrm{c d}\\ m^{-2}.$   Charge balance was also improved by  replacing CdS shells with   $\\mathrm{Zn_{0.5}C d_{0.5}S}$   shells to reduce electron  injection. The   $\\mathrm{Zn_{0.5}C d_{0.5}S}$   shell increased the electron injection  barrier due to its higher conduction band maximum energy  level than CdS. The efficiency and roll-off behavior of the device  were greatly improved, and its lifetime was also expected to be  improved.  \n\n# 5.3. Stability Enhancement by Controlling the HTL  \n\nVarious metal oxides have been utilized in the hole-injection  layer (HIL) and/or HTL of QLEDs, including tungsten oxide   $(\\mathbb{W}\\mathrm{O}_{x})$  , molybdenum oxide   $(\\mathrm{MoO}_{x})$  , nickel oxide (NiO), copper  oxide   $(\\mathrm{Cu}_{x}\\mathrm{O})$  , and vanadium oxide   $(\\mathrm{VO}_{x})$  .  These metal  oxides have excellent stability and suitable energy levels for  efficient charge injection/transport, and can also prevent the  penetration of water or oxygen molecules.  For example,  a QLED with a copper-doped nickel oxide as the HIL demonstrated a half-life time (T50) of   $^{87\\mathrm{~h~}}$   at an initial luminance of  5000  cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  , which represented a nearly fourfold increase in  lifetime compared to PEDOT:PSS HIL devices.  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, hole mobility is lower than electron mobility, and the hole-injection barrier is high in typical  QLEDs. To achieve charge balance in QLEDs, the hole mobility  must be enhanced and the hole injection barrier should be  lowered. These goals can be achieved by adding dopants with  high mobility to the HTL. The dopant 2,3,5,6-tetra flu oro-7,7,7,7- tetra cyano quin odi methane (F4TCNQ) was added to a TFB HTL  to reduce the hole injection energy barrier and to improve  mobility. The QLED with the F4TCNQ-doped TFB layer showed  only a  $15\\%$   drop from an initial brightness of   $5000\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   after   $^{15\\mathrm{~h~}}$  , while the brightness of the nondoped QLED decreased  by   $70\\%$  .  Another approach is to adopt a stepwise bilayer  HTL structure with two different HTL materials. For example, a  bilayer HTL structure consisting of poly-TPD, which has a high  hole mobility, and PVK, which has a deep HOMO level, can  effectively improve hole injection due to the synergetic effect  of the two materials, leading to increased device efficiency and  lifetime.  \n\n# 5.4. Stability Enhancement by Controlling ETL  \n\nLow work-function n-type metal oxides such as   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  ,  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  , and   $\\mathrm{{ZrO}_{2}}$   are used for ETLs in QLEDs due to their effective electron injection.  The efficiency and lifetime of QLEDs have  been remarkably enhanced by replacing organic ETL materials  with   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanoparticles, due to their effective charge injection  via their low electron injection barrier, high mobility, and effective hole blocking via their deep valance band maximum. However,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanoparticles have a carrier mobility two orders of  magnitudes higher than that of widely used organic HTLs. In  contrast to the HTL layer, the carrier injection/transport must  be delayed in the ETL layer and can be controlled by modifying  the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   itself or inserting an inter facial layer. The electron  mobility and energy level of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   have been tuned by adjusting  the annealing temperature, particle size, and doping.   Doping   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanoparticles with group III elements such as Al,  Ga, and In can increase their conductivity and optical bandgap  by generating additional free electrons in the conduction  band.    $\\mathrm{Mg}$  -doped   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanoparticles also exhibit a tunable  optical bandgap ranging from 3.66 to   $4.13\\ \\mathrm{eV}.^{[138]}$   The electron  mobility of the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   nanoparticles can be adjusted by controlling their particle size. For example,   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   particles ranging in  size from 2.9 to   $5.5\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   were synthesized by controlling the  tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide ratio. As the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   particle  size decreased, their electron mobility increased from   $7.2\\times10^{-4}$    to  $4.8\\times10^{-3}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  .  \n\nThe introduction of an insulating inter facial layer between  the ETL and the QDs is known to be effective in controlling  charge balance. Materials such as poly(methyl meth a cry late)  (PMMA), poly ethyl eni mine, aluminium oxide   $(\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3})$  , PVK,  and tert-but yl dimethyl sil yl chloride-modified poly(  $(p$  -phenylene  benz obi sox az ole) have been applied as inter facial layers to control electron injection.  The introduction of a nanometer-thin PMMA layer between the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   and QD layers to delay  electron injection greatly improved the lifetime of the resulting  QLED from 5000 to   $100\\;000\\;\\mathrm{{h}}$   at a brightness of   $100\\;\\mathrm{cd}\\;\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  .   PMMA was also inserted into the blue QLED to achieve EQE  of   $16.2\\%$   and an operating lifetime of 355 hours.  However,  most inter facial layers are deposited by spin-coating, in which  it is difficult to adjust the film thickness accurately. From this  point of view, the   $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   thin film thickness can be controlled  precisely by atomic layer deposition.  \n\n# 6. Conclusions  \n\nThe st abilities of QD materials, QD films, and QLEDs, as well  as their degradation mechanisms, have been discussed in  this article. QDs are degraded by water and oxygen molecules  through photo corrosion, as well as by thermal energy that  creates permanent trap states on the QD surface. The stability  of QDs can be enhanced by adjusting their shell, ligands, and  over coating. These approaches enable QDs to retain their  initial PL intensity and/or quantum yield under harsh conditions, such as exposure to humidity, UV, thermal heating, and  strong acidic and alkaline environments. Increasing in the QD  shell thickness with lattice matching with the core is favorable  for its stability. This goal can be realized by introducing an  intermediate shell or an alloyed core  $@$  shell structure. The  ligands of the QD should be designed to prevent moisture  and oxygen adsorption. Ligands with strongly binding anchor  groups and long chain enhance QD stability. QD stability  can also be enhanced by inorganic or oxide over coating, but  aggregation must be controlled to avoid redshift and quantum  yield reduction. Cd-free QDs are still less stable than Cd-based  QDs and further research into shells and ligands is required.  Perovskite QDs are quite unstable, and a better\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
