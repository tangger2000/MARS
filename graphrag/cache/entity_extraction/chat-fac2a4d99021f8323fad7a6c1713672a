CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The positions  of the second peak in the Ni and Fe R-space of the a-LNF(b-u)  sample are the same   $(3.0\\,\\mathring\\mathrm{A})$   (Figure 3c,d), indicating that Fe and  Ni octahedra are edge-sharing and connected in the manner of  random substitution. Nevertheless, the apparent distance of  the second distinct peaks of Ni and Fe in the a-LNF(t-d) sample  are unmatched (Figure  3c,d), indicating different geometrical  configurations from the a-LNF(b-u) sample. It should be noted  that the peak at   $2.9\\,\\textrm{\\AA}$   was not expected in the LN perovskite  structure  due to the much longer apparent distances   $(\\approx\\!3.9\\:\\mathring\\mathrm{A})$    of corner-sharing neighboring cations and is characteristic of  layered materials.  The apparent distances of the first and  second distinct peaks of the Ni center in the a-LNF(t-d) sample  are shorter than those of the a-LNF(b-u) sample (Figure  3c),  indicating that the pristine corner-sharing   $\\mathrm{Ni}^{3+}\\mathrm{O}_{6}$   octahedra  have been transformed into edge-sharing  $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}O_{6}}$   octahedra (layered) during the collapse of the perovskite structure.  \n\nBased on the above analysis and combining the formation  mechanism of a-LNF(t-d) sample, a unique local geometrical  structure of Ni and Fe was then proposed, in which Ni species presented as layered clusters with molecular dimensions  whereas Fe octahedra were connected with Ni-layered clusters  as interstitial s. The local geometrical symmetry can be revealed  by the relative intensity of the pre-edge peak. The more pronounced pre-edge peak (a transition from 1s to 3d state) of Fe  (7114  eV) in the a-LNF(t-d) (than that of the a-LNF(b-u) and  amorphous FeOOH (Figure S16, Supporting Information) samples) indicates a particularly distorted structure. The distorted  Fe octahedra most likely resulted from its interstitial state. Previous in situ fluorescence-detected XAS and density functional  theory calculations have revealed that distorted octahedra can  significantly enhance the overlap of metal 3d and oxygen 2p  bands, thus efficiently boosting the charge transfer as well as  the OER activity.  Therefore, the unique local geometrical  structure of Ni/Fe in the a-LNF(t-d) sample also promoted the  OER activity. Besides, Fe species distributed uniformly in the  NiFe-based catalysts can be dissolved in the electrolyte under  harsh oxidative conditions.  Fe species that initially incorporated at the surface/edge/defect sites of Ni species can be  moved to the bulk phases during the OER process.  The  above information clearly indicates that NiFe-based catalysts  are dynamically changed under OER conditions. The better  OER stability shown by a-LNF(t-d) than that of the a-LNF(b-u)  sample most likely comes from the different dynamical change  because of the different initial local structures. Further studies  should be performed to track the local structure evolution using  in situ XAS spectroscopy.  \n\nIn summary, through a facile top-down strategy, we constructed an amorphous and nano structured LNF electro cat alyst derived from LN perovskite by selectively dissolving La and  depositing Fe. The as-prepared a-LNF(t-d) possesses the highvalence   $\\mathrm{Ni^{3+}}$  -based edge-sharing octahedron frameworks surrounded by distorted Fe octahedra in the manner of interstitial,  which is completely different from the conventional bottomup prepared LNF counterpart. The a-LNF(t-d) sample shows a  rather low over potential of   $189\\;\\mathrm{mV}$   at   $10\\;\\mathrm{mA}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . Considering  the relatively moderate acidity of   $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$   (between most A-site  and B-site cations) and the huge number of perovskite oxides,  such as top-down strategy is promising to create a lot of novel  electro catalysts for water oxidation.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nG.C. and Y.Z. contributed equally to this work.
