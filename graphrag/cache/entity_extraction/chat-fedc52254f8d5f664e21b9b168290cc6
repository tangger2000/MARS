CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

As  a result of rapid progress in both device  architectures and compositional engineering, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as   $22.1\\%$   has been  achieved.  The high efficiency of perovskite solar cells benefits from the high  open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{OC}})$   with low energy  losses   $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{loss}}\\right)$  .  \n\nCesium-based trihalide per ovsk ites have been demonstrated as promising light  absorbers for photovoltaic applications due to their superb composition stability.  However, the large energy losses   $(E_{\\mathsf{l o s s}})$   observed in inorganic perovskite solar  cells has become a major hindrance impairing the ultimate efficiency. Here, an  effective and reproducible method of modifying the interface between a  $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$  absorber and poly thi oph ene hole-acceptor to minimize the   $E_{\\mathsf{l o s s}}$    is reported. It is  demonstrated that poly thi oph ene, deposited on the top of   $\\mathsf{c s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r},$  , can significantly reduce electron-hole recombination within the perovskite, which is due  to the electronic pass iv ation of surface defect states. In addition, the inter facial  properties are improved by a simple annealing process, leading to significantly  reduced energy disorder in poly thi oph ene and enhanced hole-injection into the  hole-acceptor. Consequently, one of the highest power conversion efficiency  (PCE) of   $\\mathbf{12.02\\%}$   from a reverse scan in inorganic mixed-halide perovskite solar  cells is obtained. Modifying the perovskite films with annealing poly thi oph ene  enables an open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\mathrm{oc}})$   of up to  $\\mathbf{1.32\\,V}$   and   $E_{\\mathsf{l o s s}}$   of down to   $0.5\\,\\mathrm{{eV},}$    which both are the optimal values reported among cesium-lead mixed-halide  perovskite solar cells to date. This method provides a new route to further  improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by minimizing the   $E_{\\mathsf{l o s s}}$  .  \n\nThe   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   can be described by the equation:   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}\\,=\\,E_{\\mathrm{g}}\\,-\\,e V_{\\mathrm{OC}},$   where   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   is the optical  bandgap of the light absorber and   $e$   is the  charge of an electron. Upon decreasing   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}},~V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  will improve and thus the PCE  will increase. An optimized organic– inorganic perovskite photovoltaic device  generally has a high   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   larger than   $1\\;\\mathrm{~V~}$  with   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   below   $0.6\\;\\;\\mathrm{eV},$   which partially accounts for the high PCE of over   $20\\%$  .  However, the thermally unstable  nature of organic materials severely limits  their commercial utility.  As an alternative, all-inorganic per ovsk ites, prized  for their superb stability toward moisture, light soaking, and  \n\nMetal trihalide per ovsk ites materials are promising for nextgeneration solution-processed solar cells because of their high  absorption coefficient,  long charge carrier recombination  \n\nthermal stressing, have received a great deal of attention. A variety of deposition techniques including spin-coating,  \n\ntwo-step sequential method,  vapor deposition,  and  spray-assisted deposition  have been developed to produce  high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films. The recent achievement of strongly emissive   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   nano crystal (NC) inks for  photovoltaic prototype device has provided a new pathway for  large-scale, single-step fabrication of perovskite solar cells.  In  spite of rapid progress in film preparation, the efficiencies of  all-inorganic perovskite solar cells achieved to date leave much  room for further improvement, principally as a result of their  large   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$  .  \n\nFigure   1  shows plots of   $e V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   against   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   for all inorganic  perovskite solar cells reported so far, and the detail performance parameters are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). One of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   NC solar cell attains a PCE of   $10.77\\%$    with the minimum   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   of   $0.52~\\mathrm{eV}.^{[23]}$   The   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   for most inorganic perovskite devices lies between 0.7 and   $0.9\\ \\mathrm{eV};$   for one  of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   device, the value even reaches 1.06. Large  values of   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   reflect defect states,  energy disorder,  and/ or in homogeneous energy landscape  that generate non­ radiative energy loss channels and thus lead to reductions in   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}};$   hence, there is considerable scope to increase the PCE  of inorganic perovskite solar cells by boosting   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$  . Recently,  the cesium lead mixed-halide per ovsk ites,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  , have  attracted increasing attention, which is due to their better  structure stability in the cubic phase than the fully iodide \n\n  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   counterparts,  and reasonable broad bandgaps of \n\n  $1.82~\\mathrm{eV}$   with great potential applying in semi transparent and  tandem solar cells.  More recently, Park group reported efficient   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells with the highest   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   by  optimizing the crystallization process.  So far, the record  efficiency of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   solar cells is around   $11\\%$   with a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$    of   ${\\approx}1.2\\,\\mathrm{~V.~}$   Therefore, it is of great urgent to reduce the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$    to improve the   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and thus PCE of inorganic cesium lead  mixed-halide perovskite solar cells.  \n\nIn this paper, we report a systematic study to minimize the   $E_{\\mathrm{loss}}$   of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   perovskite solar cells. The photo active layers  are deposited from   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   NC solution, and the as-prepared  film exhibits a sharp band-tail that enables efficient charge  transfer, evidenced by the transient absorption (TA) spectra.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/9048553834fb0d0b4decb4dcb35055f256790dc7e0045dc989bad086a27bbf90-1727116091.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   Plots of   $e V_{\\mathsf{O C}}$   against   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   for inorganic\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4-air", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
