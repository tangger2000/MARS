CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

As a result, highly dense and uniform perovskite  thin film is formed, which efficiently suppress photogenerated carrier recombination. More details about perovskite  film processed by solvent engineering can be found in the  Supporting Information. The successful synthesis of this high  quality perovskite film can be seen from the SEM shown in  Figure 2c. In addition, AFM results in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information agree with the SEM results that the solvent engineering can result in smoother perovskite layer with  better coverage. Furthermore, from the XRD data shown in  Figure S8 of the Supporting Information, we could recognize  the decrease of   $\\mathrm{PBI}_{2}^{*}$  ’s characteristic peak and the enhanced  intensity of perovskite’s characteristic peak. This suggests that  the solvent engineering during spin-coating can significantly  improve the crystal lin it y of per ovsk ites.  \n\nNext, we characterized the PD photo response and responsivity   $(R)$   both in conventional current detection mode (by  applying a bias across the perovskite) and in self-powered  voltage detection mode. Figure 2d demonstrates the photocurrent and resp on siv it y of the PD under different light intensities.  The resp on siv it y of the device, indicating how efficient the detector responds to the optical signal, is calculated  by Equation (2)  \n\n$$\nR\\,{=}\\,\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{ph}}}{P_{\\mathrm{light}}}\\,,\n$$  \n\nin which   $I_{\\mathrm{ph}}$   is the photo current and   $P_{\\mathrm{light}}$   is the power of the  incident light. Based on this equation, we determined that the  perovskite PD achieved a resp on siv it y as high as   $0.418\\mathrm{~A~}\\mathbb{W}^{-1}$  at   $10~\\upmu\\mathrm{W~cm}^{-2}$  . It is worth noting that this value is not the  highest ever reported for perovskite PDs because the resistance of the PD in this work has been intentionally increased  by adjusting the channel width in order to accommodate the  internal resistance of the TENG and maximize the sensitivity  in the self-powered voltage detection mode. The detailed circuit diagram to explain this can be seen in Figure S9 of the  Supporting Information.  \n\nIn self-powered voltage detection mode, the perovskite PD is  connected in series with a   $10~\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$   resistor at the output of the  TENG. The perovskite acts as a variable resistor with its resistance being modulated by the incident light intensity. In fact,  the TENG can be regarded as a battery with very high internal  resistance. Thus, if the resistance of the perovskite PD is too  low, the electric potential drop at the perovskite would be too  small or negligible. Accordingly, we optimized the resistance  of the perovskite PD in order to maximize the response in the  self-powered voltage detection mode.  \n\nFigure   3 a shows the measured voltage at the perovskite  under various light intensities. The voltage drop at the perovskite decreases with light intensity because the resistance  is reduced by photo generated carriers. To evaluate the performance of the PD in voltage detection mode, we measured  the change in voltage   $(\\Delta V)$   and voltage resp on siv it y, which  are defined as   $\\frac{(V_{\\mathrm{dark}}-V)}{V_{\\mathrm{dark}}}\\times100\\%$   and   ${\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{Dark}}-V}{P_{\\mathrm{light}}}};$  , respectively  (Figure 3b). The results demonstrate that the PD can achieve  a large   $\\Delta V$  of up to   ${\\approx}90\\%$   at an incident light intensity of   $100\\,\\mathrm{\\:mW\\cm^{-2}}$   compared to in the dark, which demonstrates  the excellent sensitivity of the self-powered perovskite PD. This  impressive voltage response can be attributed to the optimized  resistance matching between the TENG and the perovskite.  Moreover, the steepest   $\\Delta V$  occurred between light intensities of   $10~\\upmu\\mathrm{W~cm}^{-2}$   to   $25\\,\\textrm{mW}\\,\\textrm{cm}^{-2}$  , which suggests that the  perovskite PD is more sensitive under weak light conditions.  Meanwhile, the PD reaches a maximum voltage resp on siv it y  of   $79.4~\\mathrm{V~mW^{-1}~c m}^{-2}$  , which is a remarkably high value that  benefits from the large and stable voltage output of the TENG.  Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the TENG used in this  work was regulated at   $10\\ \\mathrm{V},$   which is a relatively small voltage  and we believe that this resp on siv it y could be even further  enhanced using TENGs featuring higher voltage outputs, as  has been reported extensively.  \n\nAnother advantage of the TENG-powered perovskite PD is its  flexibility during operation. This means it can be fabricated on  either rigid or flexible substrates.  Figure   4 a shows a photograph  of the PD fitted on a curved surface, which demonstrates its  potential to be used in real-world applications, such as ambient  light monitoring in smart buildings. Additionally, the PD shows  excellent performance stability while being repeatedly bent.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/12932a8a0bb5d39e2bf676365381b31f85d0780868f650e6ba7eb1df88991e04-1727115931.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   a) Photograph of a perovskite PD attached to a curved surface. b) The self-powered perovskite PD features stable performance upon repeated  bending at various angles of curvature. c)  Δ V  at various angles of incident light. d) The TENG output by two different people, demonstrating the highly  regulated TENG voltage output as a result of the regulating circuit.  \n\nFigure 4b displays the normalized voltage of the self-powered  PDs during prolonged operation at three different bending  angles, including  $0^{\\circ}$   (nonbended),   $45^{\\circ}$  , and  $90^{\\circ}$   under 1 sun illumination. For each bending angle, we measured the voltage after  the PD had been powered by finger tapping the device 1, 500,  and 1000 times. A detailed procedure for this study can be found  in the Experimental Section. The performance of the PD was  very stable at these different angles of curvature, as the voltage  remained unchanged even while the device was powered by 1000  repetitions of finger taping. Meanwhile, we observed the normalized voltages slightly increased when the PD was bent at   $45^{\\circ}$   and   $90^{\\circ}$  , which implies that the resistance of the perovskite increased  slightly in both cases. This can be explained by the appearance  of micro cracks as the device was bent (Figure S10, Supporting  Information). These micro cracks hinder the collection of photo­ generated charge carriers, resulting in a larger voltage drop in  the perovskite active layer.  \n\nSince the PD was fabricated with transparent materials,  including PDMS, PET, and ITO, the device can function whether  it is illuminated from the top or bottom. This can be seen from  Figure 4c, which demonstrates a plot of   $\\Delta V$   under various  angles of incidence, in which   $0^{\\circ}$   refers to illumination from  the top-side of the device and   $180^{\\circ}$   refers to illumination from  beneath the PD. When the angle of incidence was increased  to   $45^{\\circ}$   and   $80^{\\circ}$  ,   $\\Delta V$   was reduced due to a stronger surface  reflection, which results in less optical absorption by the perovskite layer. Moreover,  $\\Delta V$  for the illumination from the backside  of the PD was slightly lower than that for illumination from  the top, which can be explained by the parasitic absorption of  the ITO. Overall, these results demonstrate that the PD features  omni directional light-harvesting capabilities, and good durability under various bending conditions.  \n\nAdditionally, conventional TENG-powered devices require  a motion actuator to power the system during operation.  However, the voltage output by the TENG might be variable,  depending on how the surrounding conditions influence the  actuator’s motion, which can affect the accuracy of photodetection. The PD reported in this work utilizes a voltage regulating  circuit to ensure the detected voltage only depends on the light\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CH3NH3I<|>Reagent<|>Organic halide used in the synthesis of perovskite)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PbI2<|>Reagent<|>Inorganic halide used in the synthesis of perovskite)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to dissolve reagents)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Surface ligand<|>Organic compound used as a surface ligand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Toluene<|>Antisolvent<|>Organic solvent used to induce the formation of perovskite)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Perovskite thin film<|>Product<|>Highly dense and uniform thin film formed by spin-coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEM<|>Characterization technique<|>Scanning Electron Microscopy used to observe the morphology of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFM<|>Characterization technique<|>Atomic Force Microscopy used to observe the surface roughness of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XRD<|>Characterization technique<|>X-ray Diffraction used to analyze the crystal structure of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PD<|>Equipment<|>Photodetector used to detect light)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TENG<|>Equipment<|>Triboelectric Nanogenerator used to power the photodetector)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10 MW<|>Resistance<|>Resistance of the resistor connected in series with the perovskite PD)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>0.418 A/W<|>Responsivity<|>Responsivity of the perovskite PD at 10 μW/cm^2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>79.4 V/mW/cm^2<|>Voltage responsivity<|>Voltage responsivity of the perovskite PD)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PDMS<|>Material<|>Polydimethylsiloxane, a transparent material used in the fabrication of the PD)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PET<|>Material<|>Polyethylene terephthalate, a transparent material used in the fabrication of the PD)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITO<|>Material<|>Indium tin oxide, a transparent conductive material used in the fabrication of the PD)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CH3NH3I<|>Perovskite thin film<|>CH3NH3I is a reagent used in the synthesis of the perovskite thin film<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PbI2<|>Perovskite thin film<|>PbI2 is a reagent used in the synthesis of the perovskite thin film<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>CH3NH3I<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide is used to dissolve CH3NH3I<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide<|>PbI2<|>N, N-dimethyl formamide is used to dissolve PbI2<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleic acid<|>Perovskite thin film<|>Oleic acid is a surface ligand used in the synthesis of the perovskite thin film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Oleylamine<|>Perovskite thin film<|>Oleylamine is a surface ligand used in the synthesis of the perovskite thin film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Toluene<|>Perovskite thin film<|>Toluene is used as an antisolvent to induce the formation of the perovskite thin film<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEM<|>Perovskite thin film<|>SEM is used to characterize the morphology of the perovskite thin film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFM<|>Perovskite thin film<|>AFM is used to characterize the surface roughness of the perovskite thin film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XRD<|>Perovskite thin film<|>XRD is used to analyze the crystal structure of the perovskite thin film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PD<|>TENG<|>The PD is powered by the TENG<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>10 MW<|>PD<|>The PD is connected in series with a 10 MW resistor<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>0.418 A/W<|>PD<|>The PD has a responsivity of 0.418 A/W at 10 μW/cm^2<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>79.4 V/mW/cm^2<|>PD<|>The PD has a voltage responsivity of 79.4 V/mW/cm^2<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PDMS<|>PD<|>PDMS is used in the fabrication of the PD<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PET<|>PD<|>PET is used in the fabrication of the PD<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITO<|>PD<|>ITO is used in the fabrication of the PD<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
