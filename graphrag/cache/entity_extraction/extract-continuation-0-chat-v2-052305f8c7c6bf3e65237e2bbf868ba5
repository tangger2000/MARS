Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

Some new architectures except for conventional flexible  planar devices and techniques are adopted  to further optimize the performance and  simplify fabrication process (like helix,   core–sheath,  and 3D printing ).  \n\nPhotodetector s (PDs), as an indispensable component in electronics, are  highly desired to be flexible to meet the trend of next-generation wearable  electronics. Unfortunately, no in-depth reviews on the design strategies,  material exploration, and potential applications of wearable photodetector s  are found in literature to date. Thus, this progress report first summarizes  the fundamental design principles of turning “hard” photodetector s “soft,”  including 2D (polymer and paper substrate-based devices) and 1D PDs (fiber  shaped devices). In short, the flexibility of PDs is realized through elaborate  substrate modification, material selection, and device layout. More importantly, this report presents the current progress and specific requirements for  wearable PDs according to the application: monitoring, imaging, and optical  communication. Challenges and future research directions in these fields  are proposed at the end. The purpose of this progress report is not only to  shed light on the basic design principles of wearable PDs, but also serve as  the roadmap for future exploration in wearable PDs in various applications,  including health monitoring and Internet of Things.  \n\nPhotodetector s (PDs), which transform  light into other signals, have been widely  used in ozone sensing, flame detection,  medical imaging, memristor, astronomical exploration, and so forth.  The  most commonly and widely used PDs  are the photo electrical detectors, which  convert electromagnetic radiation into  electrical currents,  and so far highperformance photodetector s have been  fabricated based on that.  The application of such devices on wearables utilizes  the photo detection principles to meet the  practical requirements and also provides  opportunities for the realization of smart  monitoring.  \n\nFor traditional PDs, the device performance is evaluated by  the op to electronic properties, for example,   $\"5S\"$   key parameters:  sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, speed, selectivity, and stability.   However, when it comes to wearable PDs, more features need  to be considered, such as portability, flexibility, and strength  as they will significantly influence the performance of devices  under mechanical stress.  In addition, PDs-based wearable  functional systems usually require additional units such as  power sources, amplifiers, processors, potential memory modes,  and data displays to realize the complete function. Thereby,  the miniaturization and wear ability of the external units are as  important as that of PDs for a complex integrated system.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nAs great progress has been made on the developments of highly  intelligent and integrated devices, science and technologies are  expected to live in and onto our bodies in different forms of  wearables. Drug delivery,  health monitors,  power supplies,   op to electronic devices,  various sensors,  are all examples of  wearables changing our daily life. Strategies to realize “wearable”  have been proposed over the past few years, including electronic  skins,  textiles,  wristbands,  helmets,  patches,  lenses,   etc., all fitting well with the body and clothes without interrupting  or restricting physical activities of users.  A great challenge concerning the design principles of wearables is the requirement  of both high performance and favorable mechanical properties  such as strength and flexibility. By careful selection of materials, well-designed device structures, and elaborately planned  integration process, considerable efforts have been made in the  above aspects, such as employing functional polymers as active  layers,  flexible conductive materials as electrodes,  and  novel material structures like nanomesh.  Other features like  transparency,  stretch ability,  and self-heal ability  have also  \n\nThe research so far has been focused on exploring suitable  materials, designing novel device structures, adopting efficient  fabrication methods, and developing new applications.

An overview of examples of  wearable photodetector s is given with the detailed parameters  presented in  Table   1 . The first part elaborates on the main strategies for realization of the flexibility and portability of photodetectors according to different substrates: polymer which  includes planar, crumpled, and 3D substrates; paper substrates  such as origami, fiber shaped substrates including metal and  polymer fibers, which sometimes even serve both purposes  of substrates and electrode, and other substrates based wearable PDs. In the second part, we summarize recent applications of wearable photodetector s, which are classified into  three categories—monitoring, imaging, and communication— in accordance with different usages. Finally, in part three we  \n\nSummary of representative examples of wearable PDs.

Materials and Architecture Design   of Wearable PDs  \n\nThe past decade has witnessed great progress on the developments in the design and fabrication of wearable PDs. In  some work, the small size and the resulting portability of the  devices are defined as the sign of “wearable,” while in others  PDs exhibiting high op to electronic performance under low  external applied voltage are regarded to be wearable as large  power supply units are not needed.  The self-powered  property is thus attracting increasing attention in order to  get rid of external power sources to make the whole systems  portable and wearable.  Generally, there are two design  routes to achieve self-powered PDs. One route is to integrate  PDs with miniaturized energy-harvesting/storage components  like solar cell,  super capacitor,  and nano generator.  The  energy-harvesting component, which is typically integrated  with photo conductive PDs, usually operates under an external  bias to efficiently convert environmental energy into electricity.  Energy-storage components can store different forms of energy  for future usage. The other route is to develop self-powered  photodiode s based on the photovoltaic effect, where the incident signals intrinsically power the device due to the built-in  potential.  The first strategy, which is compatible with various PDs and wearable energy-harvesting/storage devices, provides abundant choices for the system constructions. Thus, the  high-performance wearable systems are realized at the cost of  increased complexity. The advantages of the second method  lie in the simplicity of its structure and the maintenancefree feature, but the photovoltaic working mechanism sets  bottleneck to the self-powered photoelectric performance. The self-powered ability is generally limited by the open-circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$  , and the photo current is limited by the zero  resp on siv it y gain in photovoltaic devices. Future self-powered  photodetector s should focus on these challenges, while novel  flexible power sources  may also be a promising approach  in solving the problems. PDs with a high photo current also  exhibit the potential to provide enough electric signals without  amplifiers, which plays an important role in wearable devices.  The illumination area is obviously limited in miniaturized  photodetector s, and a high photogain is extremely desirable  to generate decent photo currents. The traditional photoconductive resp on siv it y gain is often observed in photo conductive  devices like metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) structure and photo field-effect transistors (photo-FETs). The photoconductive gain is based on the unbalanced trapping of electrons  or holes in photo conductive materials, which prolongs the lifetime of the trapped carriers and provides additional photoconductivity at the sacrifice of response speed.  Apart from the  photo conductive gain, the novel photo voltage field-effect transistors have enabled the photo voltage and trans conductance  gain, which delivers ultrafast response speed along with high  resp on siv it y gain.  \n\nEven though a small size and a low requirement for applied  voltages are essential for wearable PDs, currently, a majority  of scholars in the relevant field believe that the key features of  truly wearable PDs are the intrinsic flexibility and the ability  to maintain a stable performance under a certain range of  bending\n######################\noutput:\n"},
