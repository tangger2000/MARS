Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a.

OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Experimental Section  \n\nPreparation of Cesium Oleate Stock Solution : A stock solution of cesium  oleate (Cs(oleate)) was prepared following the reported procedure by  Kovalenko and co-workers.  Briefly,   $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$     $(^{130}\\mathrm{\\:m g)}$  , ODE   $(6.0~\\mathsf{m L})$  ,  and oleic acid   $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mum})$   were loaded into a   $25~\\mathsf{m L}$   three-neck round  bottom flask and dried under vacuum at   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $\\sf{\\Delta}\\sf{\\Delta}\\sf{\\sf h}$  . The mixture  was then heated under argon gas to   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   until all  $\\mathsf{C s}_{2}\\mathsf{C O}_{3}$   reacted with  OA. The Cs(oleate) solution was stored at room temperature and was  preheated to  $\\mathsf{T}40~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   just before use in NC synthesis.  \n\nSynthesis and Purification of   $C s P b B r_{3}$   Nano crystals (NCs) :   $\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2}$     $(72\\ \\mathsf{m g},\\,0.2\\ \\mathsf{m m o l})$  ), ODE   $(5.0~\\mathsf{m L})$  ), OAm   $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mum})$  ), and OA   $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\:mL})$    were loaded into a   $25~{\\mathsf{m L}}$  three-neck flask and heated to   $105~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  under  vacuum for 30 min. The temperature was increased to   $170\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  and  Cs(oleate)   $(0.45~\\mathrm{mL})$   was swiftly injected. The reaction mixture turned  yellow and the reaction was then quenched by immersion of the flask  into an ice-water bath   $({\\approx}5~s$   after injection). Then,   $3\\,\\mathrm{\\Delta}m\\mathrm{L}$   hexane was  added to the as-prepared crude solution (total  $6~{\\mathsf{m L}}$  ). The solution was  centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min to remove aggregates and excessively  large NCs. The precipitate was discard and the NCs in super nat ant were  precipitated with acetone, then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The  obtained precipitated NCs were re-dispersed in toluene for further use.  \n\nSynthesis of   $C s P b B r_{3}/T i O_{x}$   Composite, and   $C s P b B r_{3}/T i O_{2}$  Core/Shell NCs :  In a typical reaction,   $20~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   TBOT dissolved in   $1\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$   toluene was added  dropwise into a   $\\mathsf{I5~m L}$   wide-mouthed mason jar containing   $\\mathsf{10~m L}$   of the  colloidal   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$   NC toluene solution   $(\\approx].0\\;\\mathsf{m g\\;m L^{-1}})$  ) while stirring. The  solution was then stirred in a glove bag at   $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   and relative humidity  (RH) of   $30\\%$   for hydrolysis. After stirring for   $3\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}$  , the precipitate was  collected through cent ri fuga tion at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and dried under  vacuum for   $\\texttt{!h}$   to obtain   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{x}$  composite. Subsequently, the  precipitate was dried at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   under vacuum overnight, and then calcined  under argon flow at   $300~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $5~\\mathsf{h}$   to remove excess water and organic  matter to obtain   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   core/shell NCs. For TEM measurements,  the   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$   core/shell NCs were grinded in an agate mortar and  then dispersing in toluene under ultrasound for   $30\\;\\mathsf{m i n}$  .  \n\nAnion Exchange Reactions :  \n\n(a)\t Preparation of Anion Stock Solutions :   $\\mathsf{P b X}_{2}$   (0.2 mmol   $\\mathsf{X}=\\mathsf{C}\\vert$   or I), OA   $(0.5~\\mathsf{m L})$  , OAm   $(0.5~\\mathsf{m L})$  , and ODE   $(5~{\\mathsf{m L}})$   were loaded into a  $25~{\\mathsf{m L}}$  three-neck flask and heated to   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   under vacuum for   $30\\ \\mathsf{m i n}$  . The   $\\mathsf{P b X}_{2}$   solution was stored at room temperature. Note: additional  $\\mathsf{I}~\\mathsf{m L}$  of trio c tyl phosphine (TOP) is required to solubilize   $\\mathsf{P b C l}_{2}$  .  \n\n(b)\t Anion Exchange Test for   $C s P b B r_{3}/T i O_{2}$    Core/Shell NCs :   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}/\\mathsf{T i O}_{2}$  core/shell NCs   $.40~\\mathrm{mg})$  ) were dispersed in   $5.0~\\mathsf{m L}$   hexane at room  temperature.   $\\mathsf{P b X}_{2}$   stock solution was added into the NC solution under vigorous stirring. The nano crystals were separated out with different reaction times using cent ri fuga tion and followed by drying under  vacuum for PL measurements.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nW.Z. acknowledges support from a start-up grant of Syracuse University.
