CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

This is one of the highest efficiencies reported for inorganic PVSCs (Figure S1 and Table S1,  Supporting Information). The optimized thickness for PN4N  was   ${\\approx}8\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . The device efficiency dropped dramatically with  further increasing or decreasing the thickness of PN4N owing  to the increase in electrical resistance in form cases and insufficient polymer coverage on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   in latter cases (Figure S6,  Supporting Information). The enhancement in both   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and  FF resulted in the significant PCE improvement in the   $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2}/$  PN4N-based solar cells. The more favorable energy level alignment at the cathode interface increased the   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   by   $0.19\\;\\mathrm{V},$   while  the reduction in leakage and recombination paths improved  the FF. It could be confirmed by the increase in device shunt  resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{p}})$   from 3121.9 to   $4385.5\\;\\Omega\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   in the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}.$  - and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N}$  free PDCBT HTL-based PVSCs outperformed those based on  doped Spiro-OMeTAD   $(-5.1\\ \\mathrm{eV})$   HTL with higher   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   which  is attributed to the deeper-lying HOMO level   $(-5.3\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}})$   and  strong defect pass iv ation capability of PDCBT.  All of the  measured  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\mathrm{s}$   closely matched with the calculated  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\mathrm{s}$   obtained  by integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum  with an error below   $5\\%$   (Figure 4b).  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N}$  -based   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs exhibited high  reproducibility and negligible hysteresis (Figures S6 and S7,  Supporting Information). We further investigated the time  dependence of the PCE of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -and   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N}$  -based  PVSCs by monitoring their power output under maximum  power-point condition (Figure  4c). For the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -modified   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  PVSCs, the rapidly dropping rate and low stable  power output (SPO) value indicated that the photoinduced  halide segregation seriously deteriorated the power output of  the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based PVSCs. In contrast, a highly stable efficiency  was achieved for   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N}$  -based PVSCs due to the lower  density of defect states and the enhanced phase stability under  illumination. We also monitored the long-term photo stability  of un encapsulated   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  - and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/P N4N}$  -based   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$    PVSCs under continuous 1 sun equivalent illumination in   $\\Nu_{2}$    filled glovebox (Figure 4d).

It is well known that Spiro-OMeTAD with dopants (e.g.,  lithium salts) can induce severe degradation processes within  the device.  The doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  PVSCs were suffered from rapidly dropping rate of PCE, while  dopant-free PDCBT HTL could further improve the photostability of  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs.  \n\nTo gain further insight into the relationship between  charge recombination s and device performance with different  ETLs, we explored the transport mechanisms in the inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs based on a variety of characterization techniques,  including light-intensity-dependent   $J{-}V$  properties, transient  photo voltage (TPV), transient photo current (TPC) measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The  power law dependency of the device   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   on the incident light  intensity  $\\textstyle\\left(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\propto I^{\\alpha}\\right)$   is shown in  Figure   5 a. The exponent  $\\alpha$  will be  close to 1 for a solar cell without space charge effect owing to  the absence of inter facial barrier or carrier imbalance.  The   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based solar cell with an   $\\alpha\\,{=}\\,0.890$   was subjected to greater  space charge effect compared with the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N}$   device  with an   $\\alpha=0.994$  . This suggested that the formation of highquality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film on   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N}$   and the favorable alignment of energy band between   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/P N4N}$   ETL and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$  improves electron extraction capability from the perovskite  layer, preventing charge accumulation inside the PVSCs. Furthermore, the slope of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   versus the natural logarithm of light  intensity for the   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -based device   $(1.43\\,\\,\\,K_{\\mathrm{B}}T/q)$   was larger  than that for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2/}}$  PN4N-based solar cell   $(1.24\\,\\,\\,K_{\\mathrm{B}}T/q)$  . It  has been reported that the occurrence of trap-assisted recombination resulted in the deviation of this slope from 1   $K_{\\mathrm{B}}T/q$  \n\nTable 1.  $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PVSCs with different ETLs. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/9d957fa86ee0dfe0dd3f29bf07eaab1aa777f1c66db512247a0489aa442445ba-1727124462.jpg)  \n\n!\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CsPbI2Br<|>Final synthesized product<|>Cesium lead iodide bromide, the final product of the synthesis process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PN4N<|>Intermediate product<|>Intermediate product used in the synthesis of CsPbI2Br)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>V<|>Property<|>Voltage, a measure of electrical potential difference)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>81.5%<|>Efficiency<|>Efficiency of the PVSC, indicating the percentage of light energy converted to electrical energy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>15.3 mA/cm^2<|>Current density<|>Current density of the PVSC, indicating the amount of current per unit area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>16.2%<|>Efficiency<|>Efficiency of the PVSC, indicating the percentage of light energy converted to electrical energy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Voc<|>Property<|>Open-circuit voltage, the maximum voltage that can be obtained from the PVSC without any load)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FF<|>Property<|>Fill factor, a measure of the efficiency of the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>8 nm<|>Thickness<|>Thickness of the PN4N layer in the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Rsh<|>Property<|>Shunt resistance, a measure of the resistance of the shunt path in the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PDCBT<|>Material<|>Polymer used as the hole transport layer in the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Spiro-OMeTAD<|>Material<|>Material used as the hole transport layer in the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Jsc<|>Property<|>Short-circuit current, the maximum current that can be obtained from the PVSC with a short circuit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQE<|>Property<|>External quantum efficiency, a measure of the efficiency of the PVSC in converting photons to electrons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SnO2<|>Material<|>Material used as the electron transport layer in the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PCE<|>Property<|>Power conversion efficiency, a measure of the efficiency of the PVSC in converting light energy to electrical energy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J-V<|>Characterization technique<|>Current-voltage characteristics, a method used to characterize the electrical properties of the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TPV<|>Characterization technique<|>Transient photo voltage, a method used to characterize the electrical properties of the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TPC<|>Characterization technique<|>Transient photo current, a method used to characterize the electrical properties of the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EIS<|>Characterization technique<|>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a method used to characterize the electrical properties of the PVSC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>α<|>Property<|>Exponent in the power law dependency of the device Jsc on the incident light intensity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KbT/q<|>Property<|>Thermal voltage, a measure of the thermal energy per charge carrier in the PVSC)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CsPbI2Br<|>PN4N<|>PN4N is an intermediate product in the synthesis of CsPbI2Br<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Voc<|>CsPbI2Br<|>Voc is a property of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FF<|>CsPbI2Br<|>FF is a property of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>8 nm<|>PN4N<|>The thickness of PN4N is 8 nm<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Rsh<|>CsPbI2Br<|>Rsh is a property of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PDCBT<|>Spiro-OMeTAD<|>PDCBT is used as the hole transport layer instead of Spiro-OMeTAD<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Jsc<|>EQE<|>Jsc is calculated by integrating the EQE spectrum<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SnO2<|>CsPbI2Br<|>SnO2 is used as the electron transport layer in CsPbI2Br<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PCE<|>CsPbI2Br<|>PCE is a property of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>J-V<|>CsPbI2Br<|>J-V is used to characterize the electrical properties of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TPV<|>CsPbI2Br<|>TPV is used to characterize the electrical properties of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TPC<|>CsPbI2Br<|>TPC is used to characterize the electrical properties of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EIS<|>CsPbI2Br<|>EIS is used to characterize the electrical properties of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>α<|>Jsc<|>α is the exponent in the power law dependency of Jsc<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KbT/q<|>CsPbI2Br<|>KbT/q is a property of CsPbI2Br<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
