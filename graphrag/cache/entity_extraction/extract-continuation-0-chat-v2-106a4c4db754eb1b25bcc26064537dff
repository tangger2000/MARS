CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

We monitored the emission characteristics of the two   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$  ﬁlms, and found all  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms show a slight increase in integrated PL intensity with decreasing temperature from 300 to  $100~\\mathrm{{K}}$  , ascribed to reduced exciton dissociation and non radiative trapping ( Figure  2 a,b ). The suppressed red-shift of treated ﬁlms suggests the removal of mid-gap states, resulting from the better pass iv ation of the bi-ligand strategy (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). Furthermore, we extracted the exciton binding energy of each   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlm by plotting the integrated PL emission intensity as a function of inverse temperature [ 27 ]  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{I\\left(T\\right)}}={\\frac{1}{I_{\\mathrm{0}}}}+{\\frac{A}{I_{\\mathrm{0}}}}\\exp\\left(-{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{b}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere    $I_{0}$   is the initial integrated emission intensity at   $0\\,\\mathrm{~K~}$  ,    $E_{\\flat}$  is exciton binding energy,    $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$   is the Boltzmann constant, and A  is the pre-exponential parameter.

The in homogeneous broadening term    $C$   corresponds to the FWHM at low temperatures, where not much thermal broadening occurs. The broadened linewidth resulting from the exciton–phonon scattering is the reason why the FWHM showed a temperature dependence. We conducted further analysis by comparing the changes in FWHM, and found that the treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms exhibit reduced FWHM values and smaller changes in FWHM compared to the control  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms: the FWHM of treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms are    ${\\approx}4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   narrower at room temperature   $(27\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ). These together suggest that the bi-ligand treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms have less phonon eﬀect because of improved ligand rigidity and less vibration-induced non-recombination.  \n\nWe employed ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (FETs) to study the inplane conductivity of control and treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms. The  $I{-}V$   curve of treated   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms exhibited an 8.1-fold increase in slope compared to the control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms, suggesting improved current density at the same voltage. By combining the    $I{-}V$   slope with the channel length and width, we obtained the conductivity   $(\\sigma)$   of   $5.04\\times10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{S\\m^{-1}}$    for the treated  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms: this represents an order of magnitude higher than that of the control   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{x}/\\mathrm{I}_{3-x}$   ﬁlms   $(6.22\\times10^{-6}\\mathrm{~S~m^{-1}})$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/92d5a63028858f423240b05c415d9882c3da27b9b0f452480dfb1f922b3caa6c-1727106061.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{x}/\\mathsf{I}_{3-x}$   device; d) density–voltage–luminance of treated   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{x}/\\mathsf{I}_{3-x}$   device; e) EQE versus current density of control and treated  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{x}/\\mathsf{I}_{3-x}$   device; f)    $T_{50}$   of control and treated  $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{x}/|_{3-x}$   device with an initial luminance of 130 cd   $m^{-2}$  ; EL spectrum of g) control and h) treated device under diﬀerent current.  \n\n(Figure  2f ). The higher conductivity results from the reduced trap density and removed OI ligands, as evidenced by the high PLQY of  $92\\%$   and  $66\\%$   reduced integrated intensity from the 1H NMR spectra
