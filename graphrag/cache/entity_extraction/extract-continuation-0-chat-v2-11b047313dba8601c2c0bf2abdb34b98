CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

In contrast,   $C12{\\cdot}C\\mathrm{s}P\\mathrm{b}I_{3}$   nano crystals  have better solubility in hexane but lower stability. (We had also  used C10 as ligands to synthesize   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   QDs, unfortunately,  the product showed no PL activity (the reason is still unclear).)  These results indicate that the chain length have great influence on the stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   nano crystals. For C2, C4, C6, C8,  and C12, the polarities of these ligands will decrease with the  increasing of chain length. In addition, larger polarity means:  a) stronger adsorption energy between those ligands and Cs, Pb,  and I atoms, which could enhance the ligand stability on QDs  surface and promote better structure stability; b) more destructive effect to the ionic structure, which could reduce the structure stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   nano crystals. Therefore, there should be  an equilibrium point between them. According to the abovementioned results, C8 should be the equilibrium point that can  receive the best stability, which shows the highest stability.  \n\nLikewise, the ratios of ligands to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and C8 to C18 have  significant effects on these properties of  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   QDs (Tables S1  and S2, Supporting Information). A lower ratio of ligands to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   might result in the insufficient capping on the QD surface  and poor cubic phase stability. Surprisingly,   $\\delta{\\mathrm{-}}{\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{Pb}}_{3}$   nanorods  form when the ratio of ligands to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   is 24 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). In addition, decreasing ratio of C8 to C18  results in reduced cubic phase stability, albeit the stability is still  better than that of the   ${C18}{\\cdot}{C}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs. A higher ratio of C8  to C18 leads to the formation of layered structures (Figure S3,  Supporting Information). Therefore, the optimal conditions  for producing high-stability   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs are to set the mole  ratios of ligands to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and C8 to C18 as 6 and 3, respectively.  \n\nHighly stable   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs were used as photoactive materials for fabricating PSCs.   ${\\mathsf{C18}}{\\cdot}{\\mathsf{C s P b I}}_{3}$   QD-based solar  cells were also fabricated for comparison.  Figure   6 a shows the  architecture of the as-fabricated device (Figure S4, Supporting  Information).

In addition  to the obvious enhancement in the PCE, a moderate reduction  in hysteresis between the reverse and forward scans for C8/C18-  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$   QDs-based devices has also been observed (Figure S7  and Table S3, Supporting Information). The stabilized power  output (SPO) measurement shown in the inset of Figure 6b also  shows that the   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs-based solar cell   $(\\approx\\!11\\%)$   performs better than the   $\\mathsf{C18{-}C s P b I}_{3}$   QD-based device   $(\\approx\\!7\\%)$  . This  conclusion was further confirmed based on the statistical analysis of measurements from 20 devices (Figure S8, Supporting  Information). Figure 6c shows the external quantum efficiency  (EQE) spectra of the various devices. One can clearly see that  the   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   QD-based device performs better than the   ${C18}{\\cdot}{\\mathrm{Cs}}{\\mathrm{PbI}}_{3}$   QD-based device, which confirms the higher   $J_{S C}$  value for the former. The charge transport properties in these  devices were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as shown in Figure 6d. The Nyquist plots show  that the charge transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{CT}})$   in the   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$  QD-based device   $(281\\ \\Omega)$   is obviously lower than that in the   ${\\mathsf{C18}}{\\cdot}{\\mathsf{C s P b I}}_{3}$   QD-based device   $(374\\ \\Omega)$  . Thus, shorter length  ligands could induce a higher charge transport rate. Therefore,  the high  $J_{S C}$   and FF of the   ${\\mathsf{C18}}{\\cdot}{\\mathsf{C s P b I}}_{3}$   QD-based device might  be attributed to the stronger and shorter capping ligands on the  corresponding QDs, which could reduce the concentration of  surface defects and promote charge transport, respectively.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn conclusion, we used a mixture of C8 and C18 as capping  ligands for synthesizing high-quality   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs. Our  results suggest that the stronger adsorption energy between the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{_3}$   surface and C8 than that of C18 in   $\\mathsf{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs  produces much higher PLQY, fewer surface defects, and better  stability compared to   ${C18}{\\cdot}{C}\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs. Moreover, the PL intensity of the   $\\mathsf{C8/C18}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{3}$   QDs can maintain   ${\\approx}80\\%$   of its initial value for 180 days. In addition, the PCE of solar cells based  on these   $_{\\textrm{C8/C18-C s P b I}_{3}}$   QDs reached up to   $11.87\\%$  , which is  much higher than that of   $\\mathsf{C18{\\cdot}C s P b I}_{3}$   QD-based devices. These  results illustrate an effective method for enhancing the stability  of   $\\scriptstyle\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   QDs and the charge transport rate of the corresponding devices, which could broaden the potential applications of all-inorganic perovskite materials.  \n\n# 4.
