CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

There have been significant developments powered by recent  advances in material science, printing technologies, and the availability of  smartphone-based decoding technology. Recent progress in this field is  surveyed, including the availability of optical reflection, absorption, scattering,  and luminescent nanoparticles. It is demonstrated that advances in the  design and synthesis of lanthanide-doped up conversion nanoparticles will  lead to the next generation of anti counterfeiting technologies. Their tunable  optical properties and optical responses to a range of external stimuli allow  high-security level information encoding. Challenges in the scale-up synthesis  of nano materials, engineering of assessor i al devices for smart-phone-based  decryption, and alignment to the potential markets which will lead to new  directions for research, are discussed.  \n\nThe field of anti counterfeiting has  a moving target. Initially, for example,  almost every country implemented watermarks or fluorescence labels on banknotes to deter copying.  Nowadays, a  broad range of optical nano materials,  including metallic nanoparticles, organic  dyes, semiconducting quantum dots, and  lanthanide-doped nanoparticles ( Figure   1 )  are available to be explored for developing  next-generation anti counterfeiting technologies. Thanks to the rapid development of  material science, wet-chemistry methods  are available for highly controllable synthesis, allowing a large range of nanopar  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nticles with distinguished optical features to be employed as  anti counterfeiting taggants. Among them, lanthanide-doped  up conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are outstanding for the  feasibility to tune their optical properties in multiple dimensions. Here, we survey the recent progress in anti counterfeiting  applications using new collections of optical nano materials as  security inks and point out that UCNPs are one of the most  promising candidates for high-security-level anti counterfeiting  applications.  Moreover, we present an outlook for future  trends in encryption and decryption devices and technologies  toward their real-world adoptions.  \n\nCounterfeit goods such as currency,  fuels,  microelectronics,  and clothing  are spreading in contemporary  markets,  causing economic loss to both customers and copyright owners. More seriously, in some cases, counterfeiting is  not only about copyright and intellectual property but also products like nongenuine medicines that can potentially threaten  people’s health and even lives, a phenomenon found all around  the world.  A report by the World Health Organisation found  that   $10\\%$   of medicines around the world could be counterfeit. The percentage in less developed countries may be even  higher.  As counterfeit goods are pervasive across the world,  governments and copyright holders have increased investments  into anti counterfeiting technologies continuously. The global  anti counterfeiting technologies market size was 51.8 billion  USD in 2017, and it is expected to grow with a compound  annual growth rate of   $11.7\\%$   from 2018 to 2025.  Specifically,  \n\n# 2. Nanoparticles for Anti counterfeiting  Applications  \n\nGenerally, anti counterfeiting is done by verifying authentic  information that can be either covert or overt. In a typical  decoding process, the retrieved information may manifest itself  as fluorescence color and intensity in patterns that are varying  in the time and space domains. As a crucial element of anticounterfeiting technology, an encoding material serves as a  carrier of distinct authentic information.  Hence, to achieve  a high anti counterfeiting level, the encoding material should  be able to offer abundant optical states that can be tailored to  carry unique information. In this regard, nano particle materials ( Table   1 ) have attracted tremendous interest owing to their  exceptional stability, control l ability, and diversity in tuning their  optical properties in multiple dimensions, e.g., fluorescence  color, intensity, and lifetime value. We surveyed and summarized several key fundamental optical features including  reflection, absorption, scattering, and fluorescence that can be  adopted for anti counterfeiting applications, and each of them  has been associated with a type of representative nano particle  material.  \n\nPhotonic crystals are periodic optical nano structures that  can reflect a specific wavelength band at a certain angle. When  rotating an array of photonic crystals, different colors can be  observed ( Figure    2 a).  For example, silica nano particle   and semiconducting nano particle  arrays exhibit structural  colors after been printed on a substrate as anti counterfeiting  marks. Based on the angle-dependent reflection of colors principle, the advanced developments of photonic crystals, such as  mesoporous silica nanoparticles  and polymer nanoparticles, have been demonstrated with solvent vapor-responsive properties. That is, the reflection colors can be controlled by the  swelling and evaporation status of specified solvents, as a new  responsive factor for anti counterfeiting encryption. Photonic  crystals can also serve as the substrate to endow structural color  feature and enhance the security level of the fluorescent anticounterfeiting marks created by fluorescent nanoparticles.   Although photonic crystals theoretically enable unlimited  encoding capacity, each anti counterfeiting mark requires  special design and relatively complex fabrication process to  allow a high-security level.  \n\nMetallic nanoparticles, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)  and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), do not emit visible light  but possess unique optical effects, such as morphologydependent absorption spectrum and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). These effects have been widely employed for  encoding in anti counterfeiting technologies. The absorption  spectrum of AuNPs can be controlled by their morphology,  thus, only the excitation light of a certain wavelength is  able to map the absorption intensity of an anti counterfeiting pattern fabricated by different kinds of AuNPs  (Figure  2b, top).  Another example applies the use of an  infrared camera as the decryption device. Spherical-shaped  and rod-shaped AuNPs exhibit maximum photo thermal  effect under visible and NIR excitation, respectively. Thus,  the thermal signal read-out that can be captured and imaged  by an infrared camera of anti counterfeiting marks composed by the two kinds of AuNPs is dependent on the corresponding irradiation wavelength.  \n\nBesides the absorption spectrum, the SPR effect of metallic  nanoparticles also contributes to anti counterfeiting technology  (Figure 2b, bottom). The SPR effect of AgNPs has been applied  to enhance fluorescent dyes modified on their surface, allowing  fluorescence intensity-based encryption; meanwhile, the unique  geographical fingerprint of the randomly deposited AgNPs can  be read-out and recorded by a dark-field microscope, providing  a higher security level. It should be emphasized that neither of  the metallic nanoparticles’ optical responses, including absorption spectrum and SPR is readable to the naked eye. Thus, this  kind of material mainly targets equipment-based high-security  level requirements.  \n\nSemiconducting nanoparticles include an extensive range of  nano materials, such as silicon, group III–V or II–VI quantum  dots, carbon/graphene dots, and per ovsk ites, etc. Owing to  their multiple energy levels at the valence band and conductive band, semiconducting nanoparticles possess both Stokes  emission and anti-Stokes emission (Figure 2c),  holding  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/b2e106ad0612204ce0985c0f217257d4785c43489c96a055f3b005a86503e54d-1727124542.jpg)  \n\nWei Ren  is currently an  associate professor in  the School of Chemistry  & Chemical Engineering,  Shaanxi Normal University.
