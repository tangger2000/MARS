CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Most liquid crystals  are made of organic compounds. They are characterized by  the anisotropy of optical, electrical, and mechanical properties.  These properties are responsive to a variety of stimuli,  including the temperature, electric field, light, etc., which make  LCs broad interesting in applications.  \n\nOptical properties of LCs highly rely on the orientation  of anisotropic molecules. The thermo ch rom is m of LCs is  achieved by tuning the orientation in response to temperature  stimulus.  In a sandwich configuration smart window, LC  molecules can be tuned in a number of orientations between  two glass slides.  Figure   7 a shows three typical orientations of  LCs and the corresponding optical states that affect the incident  light perpendicular to the glass slide. When the molecules are  assembled in helical structures and parallel to the slides (planar  orientation), the incident light is reflected (reflective state). A  light scattering state form when the helical structures are randomly tilted in a focal conic orientation. The LCs perform to  be transparent when the molecules extend perpendicular to  the slides (home o tropic alignment). In scattering and reflective  states, the reflection band is determined by incident angle of  light, the pitch of LCs, and the refractive index of materials.  \n\nThermo chromic films based on orientation transition of LCs  have been demonstrated as a good candidate for energy-efficient  smart windows. Ogiwara et  al. reported the thermal-induced  transmittance-to-diffraction states of holographic polymer–LC  composite.  The group of Yang has produced a series of thermochromic films based on the polymer–LC composites. In these  works, the LCs represented a light modulation in a broadband   $(400{-}2500\\ \\mathrm{nm})$   with strong control in visible range. They prepared a thermo chromic film based on a polymer stabilized LC,  while the planar orientation of LC molecules at low temperature  gave low solar energy transmittance, which is not desired. Later, they produced a coexistent system containing polymerstabilized and polymer-dispersed LCs.  Films based on the  system were observed a higher transparency at low temperature  and a narrow thermal hysteresis (less than 2 K) in  $42\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   To further decrease the NIR irradiation, they introduced the inorganic  nano crystals (NCs) with strong NIR absorption, such as   $\\bar{\\mathrm{[TO^{[61]}}}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/28a1e330e8683f3f2e4bc88cec6dc5d092a18b84fbdbf3cc745661344d1d8433-1727078002.jpg)  \nFigure 7.   a) Schematic of the orientation-dependent optical behavior of c hole steric liquid crystalline materials.

For example,  they developed a dual-response film containing well-dispersed  ITO NCs and LC droplets in phase-separated polymer network  (Figure 7b).  The LC could be changed reversibly from focal  conic to home o tropic orientations by either thermal or electrical  field stimuli (Figure 7b1). In this case, the transition here was  also suggested as a smectric (SmA) to chiral nematic   $\\left(\\mathrm{N^{*}}\\right)$   phase  transition. The film was observed changes from opaque to  transparent appearances during the transition (Figure 7b2). On  the film with   $5~\\mathrm{wt\\%}$   ITO, it was demonstrated with a low NIR  transmittance   $(\\approx\\!15\\%)$   from 1400 to   $2500~\\mathrm{nm}$   as well as a huge  transmittance contrast at   $400\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   up to   ${\\approx}70\\%$   between at 300  and 308 K (Figure 7c). The introduction of ITO NCs also slightly  decreased the transition temperature (Figure  7d), which was  explained as the effect of ITO NCs residue in the LC domain  after phase transition. It is worthy to mention that these films  are easily process able and were successfully produced in meter  scale by a roll-to-roll method (inset of Figure 7c).  \n\nHybrid film was studied by Liang et  al. by combining the  electro chromic LC with the thermo chromic   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  .  In the  experiment, W-doped   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$     $\\scriptstyle(\\mathbb{W}-\\mathrm{VO}_{2})$   NCs and LCs were homogeneously dispersed in the phase-separated polymer framework  (Figure 7e1). The electro chromic s of LCs and thermo chromic s  of   $\\mathrm{W}{-}\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   NCs were maintained after combination and could  work independently, which made the stimulus-responsive film  display four optical states under different stimuli: low temperature/no electrical field, high temperature/no electrical field, low  temperature/electrical field, and high temperature/electrical  field (Figure 7e2). For example, the film with   $2.5~\\mathrm{wt\\%}$     $\\mathrm{W}{-}\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$    displayed decreasing transmittance in NIR spectrum range  under increasing temperature from 25 to   $55\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   (Figure  7f).  The transmittance   $(400{-}2500\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ) was further decreased by  increasing the applied voltage from 0 to   $35~\\mathrm{V}$   with a significant  depression in visible range (Figure  $7\\mathrm{g},$  ). The optimized   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$   was  achieved up to   $34.6\\%$  , which is comparable to the hydrogel/  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$    hybrid.  \n\n# 2.6. Discussion and Comparison to   $\\mathsf{v o}_{2}$  \n\nConsidering the huge potential impact of emerging materials  on the traditional   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   in thermo chromic smart window applications, it is of great interest to compare emerging thermoresponsive materials to the conventional   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   material.  This  section begins with a brief introduction to   $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$  , followed by a  comparative discussion on the advantages and disadvantages  of each material in terms of   $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sol}}$  ,   $T_{\\mathrm{lim}}$  , transition temperature,  and durability.  \n\n$\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   undergoes a reversible monoclinic to rutile crystal transi- tion at the  $\\tau_{c}$   of  ${68~^{\\circ}C.^{[64]}}$   Below  $\\tau_{c}$  ,  $\\mathrm{VO}_{2}$   displays a distorted rutile  structure, characterized as atomic zigzag chains consisting of  vanadium ions with interlaced V–V distances of 3.19 and   $2.6\\bar{0}\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$  .
