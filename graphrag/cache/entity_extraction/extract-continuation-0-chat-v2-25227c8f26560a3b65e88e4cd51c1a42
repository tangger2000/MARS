CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

X-ray diffraction (XRD)  measurements on R-HEO and corresponding structural analysis confirmed the crystallization of a single-phase rock-salt  structure, as shown in Figure  1b.  The range of HEOs  has since widened to include a single-phase fluorite structure,  resulting from the incorporation of five (or more) equiatomic  cations, mostly rare-earth elements, here termed fluorite type  HEO (F-HEO); see Figure  1c.  However, both R-HEO  and F-HEO comprise only one Wyckoff site for the cations.  Thus, the formation of single-phase perovskite-based HEO  (PE-HEO) and spinel-based HEO (SP-HEO) materials was  important in providing evidence that this design concept can  be extended to structures with multiple cation sites. Figure  1d shows two single-phase ortho rhombi c PE-HEOs  with 6 and 10 cations.  The 6-cation PE-HEO,   $(\\mathrm{Gd_{0.2}L a_{0.2}N}$   $\\mathrm{d}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Sm}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Y}_{0.2})\\mathrm{MD}_{3}$  , reveals the possibility to stabilize multiple A-site cations in an ortho rhombi c structure upon heattreatment above   $900~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . The 10-cation PE-HEO,   $(\\mathrm{Gd_{0.2}L a_{0.2}N}$   $\\mathrm{d}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Sm}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Y}_{0.2})(\\mathrm{Co}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Cr}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Fe}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.2})\\mathrm{O}_{3},$  , on the other hand,  illustrates the possibility to form a chemically complex HEO,  wherein both the A- and B-sites are populated by multiple  cations and all the constituent elements are uniformly distributed on the respective sites.  \n\nOne important factor affecting the configuration al entropy  is the local structure of HEOs, as any type of clustering or  segregation of elements will decrease the number of possible  micro states, thereby lowering the overall entropy.  Figure  1e  shows a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy \n\n (HR-TEM) image along with a selected-area electron diffraction \n\n (SAED) pattern of R-HEO.  The well-defined lattice fringes  and the SAED results indicate the absence of local clustering  (of secondary phases), in agreement with the XRD findings,  confirming the phase purity of material. The corresponding  elemental distribution maps obtained by scanning TEM  (STEM)–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM–EDX,  Figure 1f) demonstrate the homogeneity of R-HEO even on the  nanometer length scale.  Consistent results were obtained for  other HEOs, such as F-HEO and PE-HEO.  Extended  X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies on R-HEO  (Figure  1g) suggest random distribution of elements in the  crystal lattice, owing to the fact that the local chemical environment for all cations is found to be nearly identical.  The combination of these results confirms the single-phase nature and  the statistical distribution of cations in the specific sublattice.  \n\n# 2.3. Entropy-Dominated Phase-Stabilization Effects  \n\nThe entropy-based phase-stabilization effect in HEOs is demonstrated by a set of controlled experimental results obtained from  the heat-treatment of HEOs at different temperatures.  In  many cases, like for   $(\\mathrm{Co}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Cu}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Mg}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Zn}_{0.2})\\mathrm{O}$  ,   $(\\mathrm{Ge}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Zr}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Hf}_{0.2}$   $\\mathrm{Sn}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Ti}_{0.2}\\mathrm{)O}_{2}.$  , or   $(\\mathrm{Gd_{0.2}L a_{0.2}N d_{0.2}S m_{0.2}Y_{0.2}})\\mathrm{MnO_{3}}$  , the system  undergoes a reversible phase transformation from single-phase  solid solution to multiphase mixture when calcined at relatively  lower temperatures.  For R-HEO (Figure 1h), demixing  of the rock-salt structure is observed when the system is heattreated at   $750\\ \\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  .  The single-phase state is regained upon  subsequent heating at   $1000\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . This reversible transformation  supports the entropy-dominated phase-stabilization concept, as  at lower temperatures the overall   $T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$   term might not be large  enough to compensate for the enthalpy-driven phase separation. Hence, systems that show this kind of behavior, e.g.,   $({\\bf C o}_{0.2}$   $\\mathrm{Cu_{0.2}M g_{0.2}N i_{0.2}Z n_{0.2}})\\mathrm{O}$  , can be classified as entropy-stabilized,  which is an important subset of HEOs. This reversible phase  transformation is further supported by the calorimetry data for  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/5282b454c4d9ea78a564864fac34417af90cb1aa498c2aa38ca3afc50a6fbf77-1727122638.jpg)  \nFigure 1.   a) Dependence of configuration al entropy on the number of elements.

This reversible phase transformation upon cyclic heat-treatment is not  observed for many other classes of HEOs, for instance   $(\\mathrm{{C}e_{0.2}L a_{0.2}}$   $\\mathrm{Pr}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Sm}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Y}_{0.2}\\mathrm{)O}_{2-\\delta},$     $(\\mathrm{Gd_{0.2}L a_{0.2}N d_{0.2}S m_{0.2}Y_{0.2}})\\mathrm{FeO}_{3}$  , etc.  \n\nThe preservation of the single-phase lattice in these cases can  be attributed to the formation of a thermodynamic ally favorable  structure, i.e.,  $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$  is already negative. Hence,   $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$   will be low  (zero or negative) and the influence of   $T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$  will be minimal. Therefore, in  Table   1 , different kinds of HEOs reported to date  are listed along with a distinction for the systems that show the  entropy stabilization effect (cyclic heat-treatment behavior).\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Rock-salt type HEO (R-HEO)<|>Product<|>A type of high-entropy oxide with a rock-salt
