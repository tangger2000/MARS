CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

Although tremendous  improvement was achieved in planarstructure perovskite solar cells, the certificated efficiency   $(20.1\\%)$   is still lag behind  the art of mesoporous of   $22.1\\%$  .  \n\nLow temperature solution processed planar-structure perovskite solar cells  gain great attention recently, while their power conversions are still lower  than that of high temperature mesoporous counterpart. Previous reports are  mainly focused on perovskite morphology control and interface engineering  to improve performance. Here, this study systematically investigates the  effect of precise stoic hio me try, especially the   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   contents on device performance including efficiency, hysteresis and stability. This study finds that  a moderate residual of   $\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}$   can deliver stable and high efficiency of solar  cells without hysteresis, while too much residual  $\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}$   will lead to serious  hysteresis and poor transit stability. Solar cells with the efficiencies of   $\\mathbf{21.6\\%}$    in small size   $(0.0737\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{2})$  ) and  $20.1\\%$   in large size   $(1\\ {\\mathsf{c m}}^{2})$   with moderate  residual  $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   in perovskite layer are obtained. The certificated efficiency for  small size shows the efficiency of  $\\mathbf{20.9\\%}$  , which is the highest efficiency ever  recorded in planar-structure perovskite solar cells, showing the planar-structure perovskite solar cells are very promising.  \n\nIt is very necessary to further push the  efficiency of planar-structure perovskite  solar cells. Previous researches were  more focusing on the morphology control and interface engineering to improve  device performance. In fact, for a given  perovskite, precise stoic hio me try is also  a critical issue in affecting device performance.  Son et al. found that a small  amount of excess organic salt such as   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{I}$   could be beneficial for device  performance,  while most believed that  a small amount of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   could passivate  the defects and also deliver the high efficiency.  Although it was suggested  \n\nPerovskite solar cells have attracted great attention in recent  years, as their efficiency grew from   $3.8\\%$   to   $22.1\\%.^{[1-6]}$   High  temperature sintering of   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   mesoporous structures perovskite solar cells usually deliver high efficiency and stable power  output, and present champion device was still from mesoporous  structure.  While low temperature processed planar-structure  perovskite solar cells are more promising due to simple processing and low cost, there are significant progresses in planarstructure perovskite solar cells recently. According to several  approaches, such as perovskite film crystal growth control,   interface engineering especially on electron transport layer,    and surface pass iv ation,  the power conversion efficiency  \n\nthat excess   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   was positive for device performance, there are  few study on the effect of excess  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   on devices hysteresis and  stability,  which are another two equally important issues  compared with efficiency in perovskite solar cells.  \n\nHere, we adopted two-step spin-coating method to finely  control residual   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   contents in perovskite layer, and configure   $n{-}i{-}p$   planar structure solar cells. We found that a moderate  residual of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   could deliver stable and high efficiency of solar  cells, over excess of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   in the perovskite layer will lead to the  devices with serious hysteresis and also poor transit stability.  According to finely tuned residual   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   in perovskite layer, a   $21.6\\%$   power conversion efficiency (PCE) in size of   $0.0737\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$    and a   $20.1\\%$   PCE in size of   $1\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   devices were obtained in the  laboratory, and a   $20.9\\%$   certificated efficiency was shown in  small size   $(0.0737\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$  .  \n\nWe used the   $(\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3})_{1-x}(\\mathrm{MAPbBr}_{3})_{x}$  as the model system,  which has been confirmed as an efficient absorber.  Twostep spin-coating method was adopted to deposit perovskite  layer,  i.e. first, a   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   layer was coated on the   $\\mathrm{ITO/S n O}_{2}$    substrate, second, organic salts form amid in i um iodide (FAI)  mixed with methyl ammonium bromide (MABr) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) (simply, FAI will represent almost  all the mixture organic component we used) were coated on   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   layer, and finally the perovskite phase was formed by diffusion via annealing the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}/\\mathrm{FAI}$   quasi-bilayer.  The first  layer of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   is critical for the subsequent formation of perovskite layer. Previously,  N , N -dimethyl form amide (DMF) was  used as the solvent for dissolving   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , which  usually lead to rough  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   surface due to the  strong crystal lin it y (Figure S1, Supporting  Information).  This could lead to rough  surface of the resulting perovskite layer and  also the poor contact between perovskite  layer and hole transport layer. Solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) owns high boiling  point and also it could easily combine with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   to form   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}\\mathrm{-DMSO}$   complex,  these  will slow down the crystallization of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$    while drying the   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   precursor film. We  added   $5\\%$   volume of DMSO solvent in DMF  as a mixture solvent for dissolving   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   layer,  as we expected, the formation of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   layer  from mixture solvent becomes dense and  smooth (Figure S1, Supporting Information),  which could be helpful for forming smooth  perovskite layer and also for better device  performance.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/20b44b5d60502a5e51f22dbb14a83280b46081883d5c17895d874c16ab4d8f21-1723832620.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  .
