Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a.

The Role of Oxygen Vacancy in Determining the OER  Performance  \n\nHaving shown that the presence of excessive oxygen vacancies  in PBSCF thin films led to noticeable enhancement in OER  activity, in the following part, we investigate the role of oxygen  vacancies by using a combination of surface-sensitive techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  \n\nIt is well accepted that the adsorption/desorption of reactant  and reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface are crucial for  OER process.  To gain insights into the affiliation for active  species such as   $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$   on PBSCF surface, we first compared the  O 1s XPS spectra for pristine films and the ones subjected to  thermal annealing (Film-H-6h) and electrochemical reductions  (File-V-15 min) ( Figure   3 a). The O 1s spectrum of the sample  can be de convoluted into four peaks, including the O1 peaks  of the lattice oxygen(  $(\\approx\\!528.9\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{eV}})$  , O2 peak of defective oxygen   $(\\approx\\!530.6\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{eV}})$  ), O3 peak of hydroxyl groups or surface-adsorbed  oxygen   $({\\approx}531.6)$   eV, and O4 peak of adsorbed molecular water   $(\\approx\\!533.6\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}})$  ).  The O 1s peak position observed for double  perovskite was slightly lower than that for spinel   $\\mathrm{Fe_{1}C o_{1}O_{x}}$   and   $\\mathrm{NiCo}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$  .  The thin films subjected to thermal annealing  and electrochemical reduction show clear oxygen defect peaks \n\n (O2). The contribution from surface adsorbed oxygen species \n\n (O3) to the O 1s spectra for the Film-H-6h and the File-V-15 min  samples is significantly larger than that for the pristine samples, suggesting that these surface treatments enhanced surface  adsorption of oxygen species. The contribution from surface  oxygen species in O 1s spectra for the Film-H-6h and the  \n\nFile-V-15 min samples is significantly higher than the pristine  samples, suggesting a higher affiliation of the treated films to  surface oxygen–adsorbed species.  The changes in O 1s peak  of PBSCF before and after introducing oxygen vacancies are not  due to the formation of carbonate peak,  as shown in C 1s  spectra in Figure S9 in the Supporting Information. Besides O  1s peaks, we also compared Sr 3d spectra for pristine PBSCF,  the Film-H-6h, and the Film-V-15 min. Sr segregation is generally observed on perovskite-based oxides surface,  and the  chemical environment of   $\\mathrm{Sr}$   is very sensitive to the absorbed  species such as water on the surface.  As shown in Figure 3b,  the   $\\textsuperscript{S r}3\\mathrm{d}$   spectra can be fitted with two doublet peaks, which  are attributed to the lattice-bound   $\\mathrm{Sr}$     $(\\mathrm{Sr}_{\\mathrm{lattice}})$   and the surfacebound Sr   $\\mathrm{(Sr_{surface})}$  . The surface Sr contents were noticeably  higher for the Film-H-6h and the Film-V-15 min compared with  pristine films (Figure 3b). These results suggest that   $\\mathrm{Sr}$   on the  Film-H-6h and the Film-V-15 min reacts more easily with environment to form chemical bonds such as   $\\mathrm{Sr}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{OH}$   groups, which  are consistent with what we observed in the O 1s spectra. In  consist en ce with the XPS result, we observed improved wettability of the PBSCF surface to the electrolyte after thermal  annealing and electrochemical reduction, which is likely due  to the increase of surface O species. As shown in Figure S10  in the Supporting Information, the contact angle of the electrolyte   $(1\\ \\mathrm{M\\KOH})$  ) on the Film-H-6h   $(38.3^{\\circ})$   and the Film-V-15 min \n\n  $(40.0^{\\circ})$   is much smaller than that on the pristine PBSCF films \n\n  $(50.9^{\\circ})$  . Both the XPS and contact angle measurement suggest  that the creating of oxygen vacancies on the PBSCF surface  can facilitate the uptake of oxygen adsorbate and enhance the   $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$   adsorption, which can potentially be contributed to the  improved OER activity.  \n\nTo further clarify the impact of oxygen vacancy on the surface reaction kinetics, first-principles calculations based on DFT  were performed. Gibbs free energy diagram of the four-step   $4\\mathrm{e}^{-}$   OER mechanism is plotted in Figure 3d. As a comparison,  PBSCF slabs with and without one surface vacancy were  created, with available adsorption sites investigated: Co and Fe  sites for PBSCF; Co, Fe, and   $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{o}}$   sites for PBSCF-V o . Without  oxygen vacancies, Fe and Co are the adsorption sites for PBSCF,  both  $^{\\ast}\\mathrm{OH}$   to   $^{*}\\mathrm{O}$   as potential determining step show over potential  of 0.62 and   $0.70~\\mathrm{V},$  , respectively.  \n\nIn contrast, as one vacancy was introduced onto PBSCF slab  surface, both over potentials and the corresponding limiting  steps changed. The Co site has a significant over potential reduction of   $0.33\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , while keeping the potential determining step as \n\n  $^{\\ast}\\mathrm{OH}$   to  $^{*}\\mathrm{O}$  , while the Fe site has an exothermic reaction from \n\n  $^{\\ast}\\mathrm{OH}$   to   $^{*}\\mathrm{O}$  , pushing the potential determining step to the   $\\mathrm{\\textperthousand}$  to   $^{\\ast}\\mathrm{OH}$   with over potential of   $0.84{\\mathrm{~V}}.$   The   $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{o}}$   site has a larger  over potential of   $1.60~\\mathrm{V}$   for   $^{*}\\mathrm{O}$   to  $^{\\gg}\\mathrm{OOH}$   step. The atomic structure with different catalytic centers with and without oxygen  defect and the corresponding Gibbs free energy are shown in  Figure S11 in the Supporting Information. Based on the fourstep Gibbs free energy or electrochemical potential data, it was  found that higher OER performance of PBSCF $\\cdot\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{o}}$   results from  Co adsorption site.  \n\nBesides surface adsorption characteristics, the electronic  structure of the catalysts was reported to critically determine  the electro-catalytic activity of transition metal oxides.  Band  gap is one important electronic descriptor for predicting  catalyst activity.  Oxides with smaller band gaps are  expected to exhibit higher electronic conductivity, more facilitated electron transfer process, and thereby better OER catalytic  activity.  To understand the impact of oxygen vacancy from  the aspect of defects-induced changes in electronic structure,  we used STM/STS to probe the surface electronic structure,  particularly the band gap, of PBSCF thin film before and after  introducing oxygen vacancies. To obtain a reliable STM image  and tunneling spectra, the oxide thin films need to be cleaned  to remove adsorbates such as hydrocarbon or water molecules  on the surface. Normally the cleaning process is carried out by  heating the film in oxygen gas environment.  To avoid the complication induced by such cleaning procedure, instead of measuring the PBSCF film with ex situ generated oxygen vacancies,  we generated oxygen vacancies within the STM chamber by  heating the cleaned PBSCF films to  $400~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $2\\,\\mathrm{{h}}$   in   $10^{-6}$   mbar   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   environment. The STM/STS for untreated   $\\mathrm{(w/o\\V_{O}..)}$  ) and  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  annealed PBSCF films (with   $\\mathrm{V_{O}}{\\ddot{}}$  ) was carried out at room temperature at a base pressure of   $10^{-10}$   mbar.  \n\nThe surface morphology of PBSCF remained unchanged  after introducing oxygen vacancies by   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   annealing in the STM  chamber, with a surface roughness less than   $1\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   ( Figure   4 a).  Height profile of the STM image is shown in Figure S12b in  the Supporting Information.
