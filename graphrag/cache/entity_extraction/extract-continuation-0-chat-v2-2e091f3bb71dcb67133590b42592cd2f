CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Specifically, we fixed the spin-coating speed  of   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   as   $1500\\;\\mathrm{rpm}$   (revolutions per minute)  from DMF/DMSO solution, and changed  the upper layer of FAI spin-coating speed for  1000, 1300, 1500, and   $1700\\;\\mathrm{rpm}$  , respectively.  After coating organic salt, the films were  annealed at   $150~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $15~\\mathrm{min}$   in ambient air  to form perovskite layer. The obtained pero  \n\nlayer during measurement in ambient air or unreacted   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  at the bottom close to the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layer where the FAI could not  be easily reached. Strong   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   diffraction peak for samples   $_\\mathrm{B-D}$   confirmed the obvious existence of   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}.$  , and the diffraction peak of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   is even stronger than that of perovskite for  sample D. It was also found that the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   content in perovskite  layer influences the absorption and also the bandgap obviously  (Figure 2b). Perovskite with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   deficient (sample A) showed  the smallest bandgap, and the bandgap of perovskite was slightly  shifted to wide bandgap direction while the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   contents in the  perovskite layer were increased. It can be easily explained that  in the perovskite layers, there are two phases coexisted, i.e.,   $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   phase comes from the decomposed  perovskite. It was suggested that   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   could form type II band  alignment with perovskite, and the excess   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   could passivate  the surface or grain boundary of perovskite layer.  Consistent  with previous reports, photo luminescence (PL) intensity of  perovskite was significantly increased with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   precipitation,  and the emission peak was shifted from 789 to   $782~\\mathrm{nm}$   while  increasing the residual   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   contents, the PL blueshift is consistent with absorption shift shown in Figure 2b. According to  the SEM images (Figure 1b–d) and XRD patterns (Figure 2a),   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$   phases are two separate phases in the formed  films; they have not formed an alloy, and doping could not exist  in these systems. The band edge absorption, photo lu minescence, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$   could  not be changed if no other effect happened. The blueshift of  \n\nvskite film from the combinations of 1500/1000, 1500/1300,  1500/1500, and 1500/1700 are named as sample A, sample B,  sample C, and sample D, respectively. Correspondingly, the  devices made from these perovskite layers are labeled as device  A, B, C, and D. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images  of perovskite layers with different compositions are shown in  Figure   1 . It can be found that all of the samples showed obvious  white phase except for sample A. More importantly, the white  content was increased gradually with the reduction of FAI, and  almost half of surface was covered by white phase for sample D.  Previous results have confirmed that the white phases are   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$  ,  and the black phases are perovskite materials, i.e., the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  formed around the perovskite grain boundary.  Cross-section  SEM image showed that the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   layer was mainly formed on  the perovskite surface (Figure S2, Supporting Information). For  two-step spin coating, FAI will first contact with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   surface  and perovskite was formed initially at the surface, and it could  be safely concluded that the   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   we observed on the surface  could be mainly from perovskite decomposition by heating.  \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) results shown in  Figure   2 a confirmed  the same tendency as SEM images demonstrated in Figure 1.  For sample A, almost all diffraction peaks were originated from  perovskite phase, only a weak   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   diffraction peak located at   $12.6^{\\circ}$   was observed. From the SEM image shown in Figure 1a,  it was assumed that there is no   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   left at least on sample A  surface (Figure 1a). The small   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peak appearing in XRD  for sample A might be from the decomposition of perovskite  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/81df05dcf7cb793c6ed8ea854b52e8f914d7409a28e7517973843f47c77e1918-1723832621.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   Properties of perovskite layers with different compositions. a) X-ray diffraction pattern of perovskite films with different compositions.  b) UV–vis absorption spectra of perovskite with different compositions. c) Steady-state photo luminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite with different  compositions. d) Time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) spectra of perovskite with different compositions.  \n\nabsorption, emission and EQE observed (Figures   $^{2\\mathrm{b},\\mathrm{c}}$   and 4) in  this study could be due to the pass iv ation of defects in  $\\mathrm{F}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{b}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   by   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . Similar pass iv ation of perovskite with phenyl-C61-butyric  acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been found while PCBM was  coated on perovskite surface.  Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results showed that the lifetime of   $\\mathrm{FAD}_{3}$  was also significantly increased from 110 ns for   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   deficient \n\n (sample A) to 529 ns for   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   rich (sample D), indicating that \n\n  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   actually passivate the perovskite defects significantly.  \n\nFigure   3 a shows the light current–voltage   $(J-V)$   curve of the  devices with different residual contents of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  . According to  the reverse scan (  $\\cdot V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   to  $J_{S C})$  , it was found that the devices with   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{2}$   deficient showed lower performance in all parameters,  and the devices only showed   $18.3\\%$   power conversion efficiency  (device A).
