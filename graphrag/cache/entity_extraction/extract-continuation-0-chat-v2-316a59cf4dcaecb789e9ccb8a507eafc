Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a.

Among various photo luminescent  converters, down conversion or quantum  cutting of rare earth (RE) ions is an attractive approach.  By virtue of energy  transfer processes between different RE  centers, such as   $\\mathrm{Ge}^{3+}$   and   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  , quantum  cutting can realize the emission of two or  multiple near-infrared photons for each  ultraviolet/visible photon absorbed and  has potential to largely improve the PCE  of SSCs as well as the other types of solar  cells.  However, due to lack of ideal  down conversion material, it merely serves  as a principle in laboratory until now. It is  emergent to seek novel down conversion  phosphors with excellent intrinsic optical  properties, including large absorption  \n\nQuantum cutting can realize the emission of multiple near-infrared photons  for each ultraviolet/visible photon absorbed, and has potential to significantly  improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. However,  due to the lack of an ideal down conversion material, it has merely served as  a principle in the laboratory until now. Here, the fabrication of a novel type of  quantum cutting material,  $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathsf{B r}_{1.5}{\\cdot}\\mathsf{Y b}^{3+}$  ,  $\\mathtt{C e}^{3+}$   nano crystals is presented.  Benefiting from the larger absorption cross-section, weaker electron–phonon  coupling, and higher inner luminescent quantum yield   $(146\\%)$  , the doped  perovskite nano crystals are successfully explored as a down converter of commercial silicon solar cells (SSCs). Noticeably, the PCE of the SSCs is improved  from  $18.1\\%$   to  $21.5\\%$  , with a relative enhancement of   $18.8\\%$  . This work  exhibits a cheap, convenient, and effective way to enhance the PCE of SSCs,  which may be commercially popularized in the future.  \n\nSilicon solar cells (SSCs), taken as the most efficient and  mature photoelectric transformation platforms, have been  installed all over the world.  The response of SSCs almost  covers the range of the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared   $(300{-}1100\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ), and the maximum theoretical efficiency of a  crystalline-silicon (c-Si) solar cell can approach to   $31\\%$   under  AM 1.5G illumination.  Currently, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) for most of commercial SSCs is in the  range of   $10{-}25.6\\%$  .  The limitation of PCE for c-Si solar  cells can be attributed to the low spectral response at ultraviolet  (UV) and blue wavelengths   $(300{-}450\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  ). Incident photons  of higher energy within UV-blue wavelengths are absorbed  within a short distance from the surface, which results in high  recombination loss.  Until now, various strategies have been  demonstrated on solving this problem, for instance, fabricating  different tandem solar cells (such as perovskite/silicon solar  cell,  polymer/perovskite solar cell,  etc.) or inserting various  \n\ncross-section, weak electron–phonon coupling and high inner  luminescent quantum yield.  \n\nHalide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), emerging as a new  class of QDs, have attracted extensive current interests owing  to their excellent and controllable optical and electric properties and great application potentials in various photoelectric  devices.  In particular, all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   (  $(\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Cl}$  , Br, I)  QDs are less susceptible toward oxygen and moisture and dis  \n\nplay very high photo luminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) up  to   $90\\%$  .  Recently, some transition metal ions such as   $\\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Bi^{3+}}$   were successfully doped into the perovskite lattices by substituting  $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   and considerably modified the optical and electric  properties of the halide perovskite QDs.  It is expected that  the introduction of some RE ions with near-infrared emissions  into lattices of the halide perovskite QDs can exhibit the excellent optical properties of both RE ions (long lifetime and large  Strokes shift) and the perovskite QDs (large absorption crosssection, weak electron–phonon coupling and high luminescence quantum yield),  expand their optical properties and  applications in solar cells, photodetector, and modern optical  communication.  In this work, we successfully fabricated  novel   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$  as well as   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$   codoped   $\\mathsf{C s P b C l}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Br}_{1.5}$    perovskite QDs by the modified hot-injection method, which  displayed strong infrared emissions with optimum luminescent quantum yield of  $146\\%$  . To our knowledge, it is the highest  practical quantum yield for various quantum cutting materials  reported until now.

In a typical reaction,   $\\mathrm{YbCl}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$   with various molar ratios were foremost dissolved in a  mixture of octadecene, oleylamine, and oleic acid under protection of nitrogen at   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . Subsequently, cesium–oleate solu- tion was rapidly injected into the cation precursor at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    and kept at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for   $10\\,\\mathrm{~s~}$   to maintain the growth of QDs.  The practical doping concentrations of different   $\\mathrm{RE}^{3+}$   ions in  perovskite QDs were confirmed by the inductively coupled  plasma optical emission spectrometry measurements (Table S1,  Supporting Information), with varied molar concentrations of   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$   (  $71.2{-}7.2\\%)$  ),   $\\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$     $\\mathrm{\\Delta}[0.13\\mathrm{-}1.7\\%]$  ), and   $\\mathrm{Ge^{3+}}$     $(2.0–2.5\\%)$  ), which  were about one-order lower than those of starting materials  (Table S2, Supporting Information).
