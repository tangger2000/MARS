Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface.

OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

Second, in the low frequency range of  $0.3–6~\\mathrm{Hz}$  ,  the electrons in the external circuit have sufficient time to balance the piezoelectric potential. Finally, when the force along  the radial direction of the fiber is removed, PENG can quickly  return to the initial position. Therefore,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite fibers based PENG can complete the task of collecting  and converting energy in different frequency ranges, greatly  expanding the application range.  \n\nThe output characteristics of PENG are affected to some extent  by the external load. The PENG voltage increases from 0.10 to   $1\\;\\mathrm{V}$   and the current density is reduced from 55 to   $18~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ranging from 1 to   $100~\\mathrm{~M~O~}$   (Figure  6c,d; Figure S5a, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the power density calculated  by the formula   $V^{2}/R$   can be observed, where   $V$  and   $R$   represent  the voltage and the corresponding external load resistance,  respectively. The maximum power density of the PENG is   $14\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{W}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and the external resistance is   $100~\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$   (Figure S5b,  Supporting Information). For practical application, two  PENGs are connected in series and in parallel, respectively. As  shown in Figure  6e, the resulting parallel current can reach   $343~\\upmu\\mathrm{A}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , which is approximately equal to the sum of individual outputs. This typical additive effect fully certifies that  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/ee978b50d7b81cffc33f75ae9757e4d60e2de9d8ecb126f95a8fb45c37791bc6-1727102197.jpg)  \nFigure   5.   a) The density of   $I_{\\sf s c}$   of PENGs with composite fibers prepared with different mass ratio of   $\\mathsf{P V D F}{:}\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}$  . b) The density of   $I_{\\mathfrak{s c}}$   of PENGs  with different electro spinning time. c) The density of  $I_{\\sf s c}$   of PENGs with different polarization voltages, and the inset of (c) is under potential of  $15~\\mathrm{kV}$  to polarized and the charges are arranged in order. d) The density of  $I_{\\sf s c}$   of PENGs with different fabrication method. e) Stability of PENG tested under  a final velocity of   $10\\;\\mathsf{m}\\;\\mathsf{s}^{-1}$   for 20 000 cycles.  \n\nthe electrical signals come from the assembled PENGs. The  resulting series current can reach   $180\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (Figure 6f). The  output reduction of the PENG mainly comes from the change  of the loop resistance, which can be effectively reduced by optimizing design of structure.  \n\nThe high performance of PENG based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$  composite fibers could be mainly attributed to the following  points: i) The intrinsic properties of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   and PVDF: The  piezoelectric coefficient   $(d_{33})$   of lead halide perovskite including   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs is about   $25\\;\\mathrm{pm}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$  , which is comparable to other  piezoelectric perovskite ceramic materials such as   $\\mathrm{BaTiO}_{3}$  NCs of   $28\\ \\mathrm{pm}\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1}.$  .  And PVDF with   $\\beta$  phase has the highest  piezoelectric coefficient of   $29\\,\\mathrm{\\pm}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$  , which can be utilized  to enhance the overall output performance.  ii) Synergistic  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/3d04b6dc67d1e3bbd3751912d933bd533d77142931fd0bab8f45abfb40fb3839-1727102074.jpg)  \nFigure   6.   a) The density of  $I_{\\sf s c}$   of the PENG at different final velocity and the inset of (a) is a linear motor. b) The density of  $I_{\\sf s c}$   of the PENG under the  velocity of   $10\\;\\mathsf{m}\\;\\mathsf{s}^{-1}$   at different frequency. c,d)   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and the density of  $I_{\\mathfrak{s c}}$   of the PENG with different external load resistance.

The reason is that the electro active   $\\beta$  -phase  of PVDF is nucleated by the presence of inorganic nanoparticles using surface electrostatic interaction.  Second, the stiff PVDF polymer can effectively reinforce the stress applied to  the dispersed piezoelectric   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs because of the higher  Young’s modulus of PVDF, that is,   $2{-}2.90\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$  . This increases  the local electric field and can enhance the domain mobility of  the localized stress points. Thus it contributes to enhance the  overall polarization.  iii) The morphology of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$  \n\ncomposite fibers: First, according to the former works, the  uniformly dispersed   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs in the PVDF matrix can  improve the piezoelectric output.  The composite fibers  obtained by in situ growth method possess perfectly uniformly  dispersed   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs. Second, compared with films, PVDF  fibers are separated into many segments by   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   NCs. The  NCs can act as stress concentration points when the fibers are  subjected to a compression stress. Therefore, the local deformations of the PVDF segments will be dramatically enhanced,  which can lead to larger piezoelectric potential.  \n\n# 2.4. Stability and Application of   $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}@$  PVDF Composite  Fibers Based PENG  \n\nIn order to verify the thermal stability and possible application  under harsh environment, the performance of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$  composite fibers based PENG is characterized by recording the  density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   changes at different temperatures and immersed  in pure water, sulfuric acid solution, and sodium hydroxide  solution for different time, respectively. The density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the  PENG at different temperatures from 20 to  $220~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is examined,  which show that the output of the PENG decreases slightly  with the change of temperature. The density of   $I_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of the PENG  retains beyond   $79.16\\%$   ( Figure   7 a) of its original value after  being heated at   $220~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $^{1\\textrm{h}}$\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Linear motor<|>Equipment<|>Device used to apply force to the PENG during testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PENG<|>Product<|>Piezoelectric nanogenerator based on CsPbBr3@PVDF composite fibers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CsPbBr3@PVDF<|>Material<|>Composite material used to fabricate the PENG)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Piezoelectric potential<|>Property<|>Electrical potential generated by the piezoelectric effect)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Electrospinning<|>Fabrication method<|>Method used to produce the CsPbBr3@PVDF composite fibers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Piezoelectric coefficient<|>Property<|>Measure of the piezoelectric effect, represented by d33)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BaTiO3<|>Material<|>Piezoelectric material used for comparison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PVDF<|>Material<|>Polyvinylidene fluoride, a polymer used in the composite)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Beta phase<|>Phase<|>A phase of PVDF with high piezoelectric coefficient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Young's modulus<|>Property<|>Measure of the stiffness of a material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Domain mobility<|>Property<|>Ability of domains in a material to move)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Polarization<|>Process<|>Process of aligning the dipoles in a material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Stress concentration points<|>Property<|>Areas where stress is concentrated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Thermal stability<|>Property<|>Ability of a material to maintain its properties at high temperatures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Harsh environment<|>Condition<|>Environment with extreme conditions such as high temperature or corrosive substances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Sulfuric acid<|>Substance<|>Corrosive substance used to test the stability of the PENG)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Sodium hydroxide<|>Substance<|>Corrosive substance used to test the stability of the PENG)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Linear motor<|>PENG<|>The linear motor applies force to the PENG during testing<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Piezoelectric potential<|>PENG<|>The piezoelectric potential is generated by the PENG<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Electrospinning<|>CsPbBr3@PVDF<|>Electrospinning is used to produce the CsPbBr3@PVDF composite fibers<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Piezoelectric coefficient<|>CsPbBr3<|>The piezoelectric coefficient of CsPbBr3 is about 25 pm V^-1<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Beta phase<|>PVDF<|>The beta phase of PVDF has the highest piezoelectric coefficient<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Young's modulus<|>PVDF<|>The Young's modulus of PVDF is 2-2.90 GPa<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Domain mobility<|>PVDF<|>The domain mobility of PVDF is enhanced by the presence of CsPbBr3 NCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Polarization<|>PVDF<|>The PVDF is polarized to align the dipoles<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Stress concentration points<|>CsPbBr3@PVDF<|>The CsPbBr3 NCs act as stress concentration points in the PVDF fibers<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Thermal stability<|>CsPbBr3@PVDF<|>The CsPbBr3@PVDF composite fibers have good thermal stability<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Harsh environment<|>CsPbBr3@PVDF<|>The CsPbBr3@PVDF composite fibers can be used in harsh environments<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
