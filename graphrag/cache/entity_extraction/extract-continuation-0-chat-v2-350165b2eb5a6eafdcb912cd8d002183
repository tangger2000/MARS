CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The as-prepared SFMC is indexed in an ortho rhombi c double  perovskite (PDF#01-080-8394), which partly transforms to Ruddlesden–Popper phase   $\\mathrm{Sr}_{3}\\mathrm{Fe}_{2\\cdot x\\cdot\\gamma}\\mathrm{Mo}_{x}\\mathrm{Co}_{\\gamma}\\mathrm{O}_{7-\\delta}$   (denote as RPSFMC, PDF#01-075-3655) after reduction,  and the phase  transformation aggravates with prolonging the reduction time.  A CoFe alloy phase could also be observed in the reduced samples, illustrating that Co in conjunction with Fe could be in situ  exsolved from the parent SFMC in alloy form. The exsolution  process is shown in Equation (1).  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{Sr_{2}F e_{1.35}M o_{0.45}C o_{0.2}O_{6-\\delta}}\\!+\\!\\mathrm{H_{2}}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Sr_{3}F e_{2-x-y}M o_{x}C o_{y}O_{7-\\delta}}}\\\\ &{\\quad+\\mathrm{Sr_{2}}\\left(\\mathrm{Fe_{1.35}M o_{0.45}C o_{0.2}}\\right)_{1-z}\\mathrm{O_{6-\\delta}}+\\mathrm{CoFe+H_{2}O}\\!+\\!\\mathrm{V_{0}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $\\mathrm{Sr}_{2}(\\mathrm{Fe}_{1.35}\\mathrm{Mo}_{0.45}\\mathrm{Co}_{0.2})_{1\\cdot2}\\mathrm{O}_{6-\\delta}$   represents B-site deficient  double perovskite after reduction and before the phase transformation,  $\\mathrm{V_{O}}$   represents the oxygen vacancy.  \n\nHigh-temperature in situ XRD measurement was conducted  on the as-prepared SFMC powder to investigate the redox stability by switching the atmosphere between reduction and  ox i diz ation (Figure  1c). The XRD patterns shift to lower 2 θ values at   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in Ar and during the following reduction process in   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  , indicative of lattice expansion after the loss of lattice oxygen. The phase transformation occurs and aggravates  with prolonging the reduction time. Then, the XRD patterns  shift to higher   $2\\theta$  values in air, accompanied with the phase  transformation back to double perovskite. The peak position  moves slightly to the low angle after complete re-oxidation  (green line), compared to that at room temperature, mainly due  to the loss of lattice oxygen at high temperature. Re-oxidation  serves to heal the disordered region by driving CoFe nanoparticles and oxygen back into the parent perovskite to convert into  the original perovskite (Figure 1d,e). The cyclical in situ XRD  results demonstrate that CoFe alloy exsolution and phase transformation are reversible, indicative of good redox r ever sibi lit y  ( Scheme    1 a). The reversible phase transformation between  SFMC and RP-SFMC with CoFe alloy nanoparticles is also  confirmed within thermodynamic equilibrium (Scheme S1,  Supporting Information).  \n\nPure   $\\mathrm{Sr}_{2}\\mathrm{Fe}_{1.5}\\mathrm{Mo}_{0.5}\\mathrm{O}_{6-\\delta}$   (SFM) is redox stable, with no exsolution of Fe nanoparticles under reducing atmosphere at high  temperature.  In the case of Co-doped SFM, Co cation has a  higher tendency to be exsolved toward the surface than Fe. The calculated segregation energy of Co and Fe with oxygen  vacancies are   $-0.64$   and   $0.91~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively (Scheme 1b). The  introduction of cation defects and oxygen vacancies by Co exsolution could decrease the segregation energy of Fe to   $0.62\\ \\mathrm{eV}$  and thus facilitate Fe exsolution, as obtained by DFT calculations.  We therefore speculate that exsolution phenomenon  origins from oxygen vacancies introduced after   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   annealing,  nucleated metallic Co that is exsolved from the parent perovskite with the generation of cation defects and oxygen vacancies, and then metallic Fe can be exsolved to generate CoFe  alloy nanoparticles. After re-oxidation at   $200–600\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  , CoFe  phase disappears gradually (Figure  1f,g), whereas the layered  perovskite phase remains unchanged, which  illustrates fast  oxidation of CoFe alloy to   $\\mathrm{CoFeO}_{x}$   and sluggish cation dissolution into the perovskite at low temperatures. Figure S1, Sup- porting Information, shows the surface morphology evolution  of SFMC before and after reduction as well as after re-oxidation. The nanoparticles are exsolved directly after reduction.  After re-oxidation, certain flat particles with irregular shape  appear and are attached onto the perovskite surface.  From  XRD and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) results in Figure   $_{1\\mathrm{f,g}}$  and Figure S2c, Supporting Information, we speculate that the  composition of   $\\mathrm{CoFeO}_{x}$  is probably   $\\mathrm{CoFe_{2}O_{4}}$   spinel (PDF#03- 0864). The diffraction peak that ascribed to   $\\mathrm{CoFe_{2}O_{4}}$   has a low  signal-to-noise ratio, mainly due to the low crystal lin it y of the  re-oxidized nanoparticles (Figure S2, Supporting Information).  After re-oxidation at  $800~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , a complete dissolution of the CoFe  alloy nanoparticles into the perovskite occurs (Figure S1h, Supporting Information).  \n\nIn situ TEM has been employed to provide insights at  nanoscale into the exsolution of metallic nanoparticles in  per ovsk ites under reducing atmosphere.  Herein, we  use in situ STEM and ESEM to provide direct insight into  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/543bc5ea1e9e899e9af7c40aab7a193e7b8d7f43cab4768582f20f9daa1e4ca9-1727127568.jpg)  \nFigure 1.  $38–50^{\\circ}$   of (a). c) In situ XRD patterns of as-prepared  SFMC upon switching between reducing and oxidizing conditions at  $800~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .

In Figure  2a, CoFe alloy  nanoparticles emerge during the reduction and then vanish  during the oxidation at the same location. The local structure  of the re-oxidized sample is essentially the same as that of the  as-prepared sample, with no aggregation of CoFe alloy nanoparticles. These in situ STEM and ESEM results perfectly matched  the in situ XRD results that the exsolution and phase transformation are reversible.  \n\nFigure  2b shows direct insights into emerging, growing  (circled with a yellow full line), and coarsening (circled with a  yellow dashed line) processes of CoFe alloy nanoparticles under   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   atmosphere. The metal ions may nucleate at a sub-nanometer size on the surface or inside the parent perovskite, and  then migrate to the surface. The exsolution of SFMC is reversible, therefore, we focus on in situ observation of the re-oxidation process, which has seldom been reported in the literatures.  Figure  2c shows direct insights into the re-oxidation process.  The CoFe alloy nanoparticles are oxidized fleetly to flaky particles that are attached onto the perovskite surface at  $600~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SFMC<|>Precursor<|>Strontium iron molybdenum cobalt oxide, the precursor material for the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RPSFMC<|>Intermediate product<|>Ruddlesden–Popper phase of SFMC after reduction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CoFe alloy<|>Intermediate product<|>Cobalt-iron alloy phase exsolved from SFMC during reduction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Co0.2O6-δ<|>Precursor<|>B-site deficient double perovskite after reduction and before phase transformation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VO<|>Intermediate product<|>Oxygen vacancy formed during the exsolution process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ<|>Precursor<|>Pure strontium iron molybdenum oxide, a redox stable material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>H2<|>Reagent<|>Hydrogen gas used for reduction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ar<|>Reaction atmosphere<|>Argon gas used as an inert atmosphere during high-temperature XRD measurements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Air<|>Reaction atmosphere<|>Atmospheric air used for re-oxidation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XRD<|>Characterization technique<|>X-ray diffraction used to analyze the crystal structure of the materials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HRTEM<|>Characterization technique<|>High-resolution transmission electron microscopy used to observe the morphology and structure of nanoparticles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>In situ TEM<|>Characterization technique<|>In situ transmission electron microscopy used to observe the exsolution and re-incorporation processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>In situ STEM<|>Characterization technique<|>In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy used to observe the exsolution and re-incorporation processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESEM<|>Characterization technique<|>Environmental scanning electron microscopy used to observe the exsolution and re-incorporation processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>800°C<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the reduction and re-oxidation processes were conducted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>200–600°C<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature range for re-oxidation process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CoFe2O4<|>Final product<|>Spinel phase formed after re-oxidation of CoFe alloy nanoparticles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PDF#01-080-8394<|>Reference<|>PDF card number for the orthorhombic double perovskite structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PDF#01-075-3655<|>Reference<|>PDF card number for the Ruddlesden–Popper phase structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Scheme S1<|>Reference<|>Scheme number in the Supporting Information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Scheme 1a<|>Reference<|>Scheme number in the main text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Scheme 1b<|>Reference<|>Scheme number in the main text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DFT calculations<|>Method<|>Density functional theory calculations used to predict the segregation energy of Co and Fe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Figure 1a,b<|>Reference<|>Figure numbers in the main text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Figure 1c<|>Reference<|>Figure number in the main text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Figure 1d,e<|>Reference<|>Figure numbers in the main text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Figure 1f,g<|>Reference<|>Figure numbers in the main text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Figure 2<|>Reference<|>Figure number in the main text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Figure S1<|>Reference<|>Figure number in the Supporting Information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Figure S2<|>Reference<|>Figure number in the Supporting Information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Figure S3<|>Reference<|>Figure number in the Supporting Information)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SFMC<|>RPSFMC<|>SFMC transforms to RPSFMC after reduction<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SFMC<|>CoFe alloy<|>CoFe alloy is exsolved from SFMC during reduction<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Co0.2O6-δ<|>VO<|>Oxygen vacancies are formed during the exsolution process<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SFM<|>CoFe alloy<|>No exsolution of Fe nanoparticles in SFM under reducing atmosphere<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Co<|>Fe<|>Co exsolution facilitates Fe exsolution<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CoFe alloy<|>CoFe2O4<|>CoFe alloy is oxidized to CoFe2O4 after re-oxidation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>In situ XRD<|>Phase transformation<|>In situ XRD is used to observe phase transformations<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>In situ TEM<|>Exsolution/re-incorporation<|>In situ TEM is used to observe the exsolution and re-incorporation processes<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>800°C<|>Reduction<|>Reduction process is conducted at 800°C<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>200–600°C<|>Re-oxidation<|>Re-oxidation process is conducted at 200–600°C<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CoFe2O4<|>Perovskite<|>CoFe2O4 is formed on the perovskite surface after re-oxidation<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
