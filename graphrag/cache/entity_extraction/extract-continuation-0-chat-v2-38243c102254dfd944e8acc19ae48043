CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2OâZr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZrÂ·OH+OHÂ·ZrâÂ·ZrÂ·OÂ·ZrÂ·+H2O\nZrÂ·OC4H9+HOÂ·ZrâÂ·ZrÂ·OÂ·ZrÂ·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 Âµmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

After electrical erasing operation, the threshold voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right)$   can be shifted back to its initial state, implying the release  of the trapped electrons.Â A memory window of   ${\\approx}16.47\\mathrm{~V~}$   was  obtained which is defined as the difference between the programmed state   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   and erased state   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$  .Â Typical   $I{-}V$  curves of  the memory device programmed with various light irradiance  are shown in Figure 2c.   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   of memory device in the initial state  is located at   $-12.51$   V.Â Note that the   $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$   of the memory device  gradually shifted from  $-9.09$   to   $-5.48$  ,   $-1.12$  , and   $2.99\\ \\mathrm{V}$   when  the light intensity increased from 0.041 to 0.069, 0.129, and   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~}\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  .  \n\nTo address the maintenance capability of the trapped charge  carriers, light programming operations with a series of control  parameters were carried out on the flash memory.Â  Figure 2d  shows the transient curve of flash memory programmed by  the light pulses with fixed irradiance of   $0.153\\,\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}}$   and  wavelength ranging from 365 to   $660\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  .Â  Light illumination  with short wavelengths induces the large enhancement of  the   $I_{\\mathrm{DS}}$   which can reach   ${\\approx}10^{-8}$   A for   $520~\\mathrm{nm}$  ,   ${\\approx}6\\times10^{-8}$   A for   $450\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , and   ${\\approx}10^{-7}$   A for   $365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   while red light irradiation   $(660~\\mathrm{nm})$  ) produces weakest effect which is consistent with the  strong absorption of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   in the UV region.Â All the photoprogrammed states can be maintained for more than   $1\\times10^{4}$   s  without obvious degradation.Â The stable current levels promise  at least four data level storage in one single memory cell  through simple tuning the light wavelength.Â Figure 2e outlines  the impact of the light intensity on the memory devices.Â With  a fixed wavelength of   $365~\\mathrm{nm}$  , the light intensity is varied from  0.041 to   $0.153\\mathrm{~mW~cm}^{-2}$  .Â Photo-to-dark current ratio is gradually increased with the enhanced light intensity.Â  The photoprogramming process is also highly dependent on theÂ  light  illuminating time, which can be applied to control the photoÂ­ recording functionality.Â  As shown in Figure   $2\\mathrm{f}_{\\ast}$  , illumination  with longer endurance induces a higher recorded current  after the photo programming.Â However,   $I_{\\mathrm{DS}}$   almost achieves its  maximum level after light programming operation with the  pulse width longer than   $120~\\mathrm{s}$  , which is attributed to the limited charge trapping centers inside the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs layer.Â As  the surface of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs layer is passivated by PMMA  film, the flash memory shows uniform electrical characteristics  in Figure S3 (Supporting Information).Â  The good reproducibility of the repetitive photo programming and electrical-erasing  cycles in ambient conditions is depicted in Figure 2g.Â Both the  programmed erased states of the device can be maintained  for cyclic operations of   $10^{3}$   times without significant fluctuations.Â The retention test in Figure S4 (Supporting Information)  suggests the possibility of attaining the industry-standard of ten  years data retention.  \n\nThe energy band diagrams of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  -based flash memories  under light programming operation and the electric erasing  operation

Schematic energy diagram  of the device during light programming operation and during electrical erasing operation under dark condition.  \n\nphoto programming operation, large numbers of charge carriers were generated in the active layer.Â Photo generated holes  can easily escape from the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   to pentacene through a  bending of energy band and thus leaving behind photoinduced  electrons in the conduction band of the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  .Â The trapped  electrons can act as an additional internal electric filed which  further accelerates the holes to be swept into the semiconductor  channel.Â After the removal of the light stimuli, trapped charge  carriers are retained by the potential well for a long lifetime.  \n\nWe further demonstrate that the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  -based flash  memory is capable of emulating the information transmission  in neuro m orphic architectures.Â As shown in  Figure   3 a, synapse  is the functional link between the neurons.
