Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

Despite these merits,  QDs still have issues with toxicity, efficiency, and instability. The use of QDs  containing toxic heavy metals (Cd, Hg,  and Pb) is restricted by the Restriction of  Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS)  in the European Union. However, toxicmetal-free QDs such as InP and   $\\mathrm{CuInS}_{2}$    exhibit limited emission bandwidth and  quantum yield, as well as limited stability.  Their device efficiencies are  lower than those of Cd-based QDs in  both QD films and QLEDs. In particular,  InP QDs are unstable in QD photoluminescence (PL) films and QLEDs under  ambient conditions without gas barrier  films. This instability is considered to be  the most serious obstacle for the commercia liz ation of PL films and QLEDs. QDs  can be degraded by exposure to water,  oxygen, UV, and thermal heating. In this  article, various approaches to enhance the  stability of semiconductor QDs, including  \n\nQuantum dots (QDs) are being highlighted in display applications for their  excellent optical properties, including tunable bandgaps, narrow emission  bandwidth, and high efficiency. However, issues with their stability must be  overcome to achieve the next level of development. QDs are utilized in display  applications for their photo luminescence (PL) and electroluminescence. The  PL characteristics of QDs are applied to display or lighting applications in  the form of color-conversion QD films, and the electroluminescence of QDs  is utilized in quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). Studies on the  stability of QDs and QD devices in display applications are reviewed herein.  QDs can be degraded by oxygen, water, thermal heating, and UV exposure.  Various approaches have been developed to protect QDs from degradation  by controlling the composition of their shells and ligands. Phosphorescent  QDs have been protected by bulky ligands, physical incorporation in polymer  matrices, and covalent bonding with polymer matrices. The stability of  electro luminescent QLEDs can be enhanced by using inorganic charge  transport layers and by improving charge balance. As understanding of the  degradation mechanisms of QDs increases and more stable QDs and   display devices are developed, QDs are expected to play critical roles in  advanced display applications.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nII–VI, III–V, and perovskite compounds, color conversion QD  films, and QLEDs, will be discussed.  \n\nQuantum dots (QDs) have emerged as next-generation semiconducting materials due to their tunable bandgaps and function aliz able characteristics.  QDs are being applied in various  devices in the fields of displays, photovoltaics, and transistors.  Among these, QDs have recently been commercialized in display applications in the form of QD films for liquid  crystal display (LCD) panels, and they will soon be applied  in color conversion matrices in micro light-emitting diodes   $(\\upmu$  -LED) and self-emitting layers in quantum dot light-emitting  diodes (QLEDs), due to their narrow-emission spectra, wide  color gamut, and high quantum yield.  QLEDs have recently  \n\n# 2. Degradation Mechanism of QDs  \n\n# 2.1. Influences of Oxygen and Water Combined with Light  \n\nQDs are known to be degraded via various molecular interactions with oxygen and water. Oxygen and water physically and/ or chemically adsorb on the QD surface, which can enhance  or degrade their optical performance.  Studies of the degradation mechanism and stability of colloidal QDs have mainly  focused on Cd-based QDs. CdSe QDs have been reported to  show enhanced PL when exposed to moisture under light  illumination; this phenomenon is called photo activation. This  enhancement in QD performance is believed to result from the  pass iv ation of surface trap states by the adsorbed water molecules.  The pass iv ation of trap states allows electrons  to repopulate from the trap states to the conduction band of  the QDs, resulting in increased band-edge radiative recombination.  This process can be reversed by detaching  the ph ys is or bed water molecules with inert-gas purging or  vacuum degassing, as shown in  Figure   1 .  Photo activation  by chem is or bed oxygen has also been reported. When photoexcited QDs are exposed to oxygen, they undergo surface oxidation; this mechanism is called photo oxidation. As shown in  Figure   2 , photo oxidation converts the surface of the CdSe QDs  to CdO,  $\\mathrm{{se}O_{2}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{CdSeO}_{x}$  .  The QD surface trap states are  also eliminated by pass iv ation by   $\\mathrm{{se}O_{2}}$   and/or by smoothing  through the dissociation of   $\\mathrm{{se}O_{2}}$  .  Photo activation has been  reported to occur mainly due to the pass iv ation of trap states on  the surface of the CdSe core, rather than on the shell.  \n\nHowever, the optical characteristics of QDs are irreversibly  degraded when photo excited QDs are continuously exposed  to oxygen molecules for long periods.  Long-term oxygen  exposure induces the formation of surface trap states and  causes permanent fluorescence quenching. Ions such as  $\\mathrm{{seO^{3-}}}$    and   $C_{ Ḋ }\\mathrm{d}^{2+} Ḍ$   are produced by photo oxidation, and dissociate from  the core in a process called photo corrosion.  Photo corrosion  generates surface trap states and causes a reduction in the core  size, resulting in permanent PL quenching, spectrum broadening, and a blueshift of the band-edge emission.  The  stability of photo luminescence characteristics can be enhanced  by shell engineering.  However, it is difficult to protect  the cores if the shells are not grown epi taxi ally on the core surface.  None pit axial growth of the shells may occur due  to lattice mismatch between CdSe and   $Z\\mathrm{n}S$  , which also causes  defects in the core and shell interfaces.  \n\nThe most well-known Cd-free QDs, InP QDs, are quite sensitive to oxygen.  The use of thick shells without grain boundaries can protect InP QDs, but implementing this strategy is  challenging. One possible reason is the surface oxidation of InP  QDs during the synthesis process.  The surface oxidation  of InP QDs is mainly due to the water molecules generated  during InP QD synthesis.    $\\mathrm{InP}$   QDs have stronger covalent  bonding compared to II–VI QDs, and a high growth temperature of above   $188~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   is required.  At this high temperature,  carboxylic acids, which are widely used in InP QD synthesis,  generate water via the side reaction shown below  \n\n$$\n2\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\right)_{14}\\mathrm{COOH}\\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{In\\,P\\,QDs,\\,300\\,\\,^{\\circ}C}}\\left[\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\right)_{14}\\right)\\right]_{2}\\mathrm{CO}+\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\n$$  \n\nThe amorphous phase of the surface oxide can inhibit epitaxial growth of the   $Z\\mathrm{n}S$   shell, as can the relatively large lattice  mismatch between the surface oxide and   $\\mathrm{ZnS.}^{[24]}$   The lattice  constant of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   is   $10.12\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$  , which is very different from that  of   $Z\\mathrm{n}S$   (5.41 Å).  \n\nPerovskite structures have generally the chemical formula   $\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$  , where “A ” and “B” are cations of different sizes and “X” is  anion. Perovskite QDs can be divided into two types depending  on the material used as cation “A.” The first is the organic– inorganic hybrid type, in which “A ” is an organic substance \n\n (e.g., methyl amine (MA), ethylamine (EA), or form amid in i um \n\n (FA)). The second is the all-inorganic type containing an inorganic cation such as Cs. Pb and Sn are the most common “B”  cations, and halogen anions such as Cl, Br, and I are\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Quantum dots
