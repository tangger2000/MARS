CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

These findings are in agreement with other reports indicating improvements in device interfaces and perovskite film quality are  critically important to improve the overall efficiency of  PVSCs.  \n\nEIS measurements were also carried out to investigate the  inter facial charge transfer properties in PVSCs.  Herein,  the EIS spectra were measured at an applied bias of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   with a  frequency range from   $1\\:\\mathrm{MHz}$   to  $1\\;\\mathrm{Hz}$   and  $10\\:\\mathrm{mA}$   AC amplitude  under illumination of simulated solar AM1.5 global light at   $100\\ \\mathrm{mW\\cm^{-2}}$  . Figure 5d presented the Nyquist plots from the  impedance spectra results for the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL-modified devices. We used a simple circuit model  to fit these Nyquist curves by Z-View software. There are two  semi c irl ces that can be fitted in the high-frequency region  and low-frequency region, respectively. Normally, the highfrequency arc displayed the transport process with combining  the transport resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{trans}}\\right)$   and the transport chemical  capacitance   $\\left(C_{\\mathrm{trans}}\\right)$   feature that related to the charge transport from the cathode to the anodes. The low-frequency arc or  the main arc shows the recombination process by integrating  the recombination resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{rec}})$   and the chemical capacitance   $(C_{\\mathrm{rec}})$  . As shown in Figure 5d, it is clear that the   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   of   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL-based devices have larger values  than the   $R_{\\mathrm{rec}}$   of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL-based devices, which indicates the  stronger recombination process occured in the single-layer   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETL-based devices. Therefore, the significant enhancement of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   and PCE can also be attributed to the decreased  recombination rate in   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL-based devices.  In addition, the poor efficiencies of   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  -based PVSCs could  also be attributed to the severe charge recombination and low  extraction efficiency compared with the reference   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -based  devices (Figure S7, Supporting Information).  \n\nIn conclusion, our work has demonstrated a dramatic  enhancement of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   FF, and PCE in all-inorganic PVSCs  through the introduction of a   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL aiming  to improve the charge extraction properties and energy level  alignment in the devices. The high-quality   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   film with  full coverage and regular crystal grains can be realized on the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   surface. It was found that the favorable matching of  cascade energy band between the  $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{I}}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   enables a more efficient extraction of photo generated  electron from perovskite layer to ITO electrode, resulting in the  suppressed inter facial trap-assisted recombination with a lower  charge recombination rate and greater charge extraction efficiency. The efficiencies of all-inorganic   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\I}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}$   PVSCs with  the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}/Z n O}$   bilayered ETL were demonstrated to be over   $14\\%$   and their long-term thermal stability greatly outperformed  those with the organic–inorganic PVSCs. These findings provide important interface design insights that will be crucial to  further improve the efficiency of all inorganic PVSCs in the  future.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation  of China (Nos. 91633301, 91733302, 21761132001, and 51573057),  the Ministry of Science and Technology (Nos. 2014 CB 643505 and  2017 Y F 0206600), and the Science and Technology Program of  Guangzhou, China (Nos. 201607020010 and 2017A050503002).  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/77edc09e31a22bf0c8f2c87efb8695ea54ed15f5884b7788074ef92685126201-1727118597.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $J-V$   properties of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}.$  - and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/Z\\mathsf{n O}.$  -based   $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PVSCs. b) Transient photo voltage and c) transient  photo current measurements for  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}.$  - and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/Z\\mathsf{n O}$  -based   $\\mathsf{C s P b I}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PVSCs. d) Nyquist plots of the   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2^{\\cdot}}$   and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/Z\\mathsf{n O}$  -based  $\\mathsf{C s P b l}_{2}\\mathsf{B r}$   PVSCs.
