CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Moreover,  $\\Delta V$  for the illumination from the backside  of the PD was slightly lower than that for illumination from  the top, which can be explained by the parasitic absorption of  the ITO. Overall, these results demonstrate that the PD features  omni directional light-harvesting capabilities, and good durability under various bending conditions.  \n\nAdditionally, conventional TENG-powered devices require  a motion actuator to power the system during operation.  However, the voltage output by the TENG might be variable,  depending on how the surrounding conditions influence the  actuator’s motion, which can affect the accuracy of photodetection. The PD reported in this work utilizes a voltage regulating  circuit to ensure the detected voltage only depends on the light  intensity, rather than the mechanical pressure being applied  to the TENG. Furthermore, this design allows the PD to function properly even under irregular mechanical motions (for  example, in this work we powered the device by finger tapping),  which greatly enhances the versatility of the system. Figure 4d  shows two sets of the TENG output (displayed in blue and red)  when operated by two different people. The results are highly  consistent, which is important for ensuring the accuracy in the  self-powered voltage detection mode.  \n\nBesides systematically characterizing the PD in the lab, we  also performed field tests to study the device performance under  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/9647ed1cb5aaf30c4045a64740369010e8e7658e29c4cea4b98453041b9a44e1-1727115914.jpg)  \nFigure 5.  $\\Delta V$   and PDCR of the perovskite PD under sunny, cloudy, and room lighting conditions.

A detailed description of the field tests can  be found in the Experimental Section.  Figure   5  presents the  photo-to-dark current ratio (PDCR, defined as   $\\frac{\\left(I_{\\mathrm{light}}-I_{\\mathrm{dark}}\\right)}{I_{\\mathrm{dark}}}\\,)$  )  and   $\\Delta V$   of the PD, which represent the results from the conventional current detection mode and the self-powered voltagedetection mode, respectively, both of which feature the same  trend. Notably, the PD exhibited a   $\\Delta V$   of   $58\\%$  ,   $45\\%$  , and   $16\\%$    on sunny, cloudy, and room lighting conditions, respectively,  which shows the PD can clearly distinguish between different  levels of light. We ascribe this performance to the optimized  resistance matching between the perovskite PD and the TENG.  These results demonstrate the strong functionality and sensitivity of the self-powered PD in real-world environments.  \n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a self-powered, flexible and transparent organometallic halide perovskite PD. The  photo­ detector is versatile and exhibits stable prolonged operation under different bending angles, different environments,  and varying incident angles of light. The PD also exhibits an  impressive detect iv it y of   $\\bar{1.22\\times10^{13}}$   Jones in the current detection mode, and a large resp on siv it y of up to   $79.4\\,\\mathrm{V}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{W}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   in  self-powered voltage detection mode. These results were made  possible through the use of a high quality   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   thin  film, which we achieved using solvent engineering. In addition,  the PD demonstrates a voltage response of up to  ${\\approx}90\\%$   between  the highest and the lowest light intensities studied, which can  be attributed to the optimized resistance matching between the  TENG and the PD. More importantly, with the voltage regulating  circuit, the self-powered PD functions with regular precision  even as irregular mechanical forces are applied, such as by  human finger tapping, all without the aid of a bulky external  power system or motion actuator. These results demonstrate a  simple and promising approach for developing a flexible and  self-powered sensing system for applications such as smart textiles and smart buildings.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nFabrication of the Perovskite PD : A   $5.5\\ \\mathsf{c m}\\times5$   cm commercial   $\\mathsf{T O}/\\mathsf{\\bar{T}O}$  PET film (Sigma-Aldrich) with resistivity of   $100\\,\\textrm{\\textOmega}\\mathfrak{s q}^{-1}$   area and a   $5\\ {\\mathsf{c m}}\\times5\\ {\\mathsf{c m}}$   PDMS-coated PET film (Gel-Pak, PF film) was prepared  and cleaned with acetone, iso prop an ol, and deionized water. A 1:1  molar ratio of   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}|$   (Dyesol) and   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   (  $(99.9985\\%$  , Alfa Aesar)  were dissolved in a solution composed of gamma-bu tyrol act one and  dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent grade)   $(3{\\cdot}2,\\ \\mathsf{v}/\\mathsf{v})$   at   $50~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $24{\\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The perovskite solution was filtered (PTFE filter,   $0.45\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$  pore size, Fisher brand) and then spin-coated onto a   $\\rceil.5\\times\\rceil.5\\textsf{c m}^{2}$   area  as defined by Kapton tape on the PET side of the ITO/PET film. Spincoating involved two stages at 5000 and 1000 rpm for 20 and   $\\mathsf{\\Delta}^{\\mathsf{T}_{0}}\\mathsf{s}$  ,  respectively. Approximately   $50~\\upmu\\mathsf{L}$   of toluene was added drop-by-drop  during the second stage of spin-coating to form an intermediate  phase that prevented the   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{I}$   and   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   reagents from reacting  too quickly, thus enabling a uniform   $\\mathsf{C H}_{3}\\mathsf{N H}_{3}\\mathsf{P b}|_{3}$   film to be deposited  onto the PET surface. Two   $40\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   thick gold electrodes were then  deposited   $100~\\upmu\\mathsf{m}$   apart on top of the perovskite layer by e-beam  evaporation. For the other side of the TENG electrode, a   $200\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   thick  layer of ITO was deposited on the PET side of the PDMS-coated PET  film by DC magnetron sputtering. Finally, the two films were bonded  together with the ITO side of the ITO/PET film facing the PDMS side  of the other film using Kapton tape. A small gap of about   $5~\\mathsf{m m}$   was  left between the two films since one film was slightly longer than the  other as shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information.  \n\nVoltage Regulating Circuits : The voltage regulating circuits which limit  the output voltage of the TENGs consist of a Zener diode and resistor.  Zener diode allows a wide range of currents when a reverse voltage  exceeds a threshold value which called Zener voltage. In this work, a  Zener diode with Zener voltage of   $10~\\lor$  has been chosen and connected  it at the output of the TENGs. As a result, the voltage of the TENGs is  regulated at  $10\\;\\lor.$  \n\nDevice  Characterization  and  Field  Testing  Conditions :  SEM  characterization was performed using an FEI Zeiss Merlin field  emission SEM. An Enlitech 350 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G filter was  used for 1 sun simulated illumination.
