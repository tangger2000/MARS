CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

It  is apparent that the transmittance decreases with increase of  the ITO layer thickness, while the conductivity is significantly  increased as expected. Accordingly, the F-PSCs based on various ITO thicknesses were fabricated, and their current density–voltage   $(J-V)$   characteristics and key parameters are shown  in Figure S5b and Table S2 (Supporting Information). It can be  seen that the device with   $90\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick ITO gives the highest   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   due to the good transmittance, while the FF is the smallest  because of the largest sheet resistance   $(92~\\Omega)$  . When the ITO  thickness is increased to   $180\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , the   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   evidently decreased  owing to the inferior transmittance. Finally, in order to keep a  good balance between high optical transmittance and low sheet  resistance to obtain optimized result,   $160\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   thick ITO was  \n\ncoated on PET substrates to fabricated the F-PSCs. The PCE  reaches to   $16.64\\%$   with  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $21.46\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ,   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of 1.092, and  FF of 0.710. In addition, when   $\\mathrm{MgF}_{2}$   was used to reduce optical  reflection (Figure S6a, Supporting Information), the PCE is further increased to   $17.03\\%$   (Figure S6b, Supporting Information). The DS volume ratio with solvent was further optimized on  the basis of the above results. For the test, the F-PSCs with different DS concentrations were investigated to clarify the influence of the DS on the performance of the F-PSCs. Figure S7  (Supporting Information) shows the  $J{-}V$  curves of the flexible  devices, with key  $J{-}V$  parameters summarized in Table S3 (Supporting Information). It is clear that the PCE initially increases  when the DS volume ratio is increased from   $0\\%$   to   $10\\%$  . It  reaches the maximum at   $10\\%$  . It then decreases with the DS  volume ratio. Apparently, when the DS volume ratio is smaller  than   $10\\%$  , it is too low to cause significant effect because of  the weak interaction with   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   cation, yielding low FF and therefore poor PCE. However, when the volume ratio is over   $10\\%$  the excessive DS would cause higher   $R_{s}$   and smaller shunt  resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{sh}})$   (Table S3, Supporting Information), resulting  in reduced FF.  Consequently, we adopted   $10\\%$   DS to modify  the perovskite films and fabricate high performance F-PSCs.  Figure 2b shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the completed device, it is clear that the perovskite crystal grains grow  large enough to go through the film thickness, consistent with  the top-view SEM results (Figure 1c). Figure 2c shows the  $J{-}V$  curves of F-PSCs based on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$   under AM   $1.5G$   illumination with   $100\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}}$   at both reverse and forward scan directions, with key  $J{-}V$   parameters listed in  Table   1 The flexible device without DS additive under reverse scan directions exhibits the PCE of   $17.03\\%$   with   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\,=\\,21.97~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}=1.090{\\mathrm{~V}},$   and   $\\mathrm{FF}=0.711$  . Interestingly, when the DS additive was used under the same conditions, the   ${\\cal J}_{\\mathrm{sc}},\\ {\\cal V}_{\\mathrm{oc}},$   and FF  increase to   $22.48\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}\\,\\mathrm{\\cm}^{-2}$  ,   $1.103\\;\\mathrm{~V~},$  , and 0.742, respectively,  yielding a PCE as high as   $18.40\\%$  , the highest reported so far  for F-PSCs. The significantly larger   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and FF are attributed  to good crystal lin it y and large grain size, resulting in effective  charge transport and less carrier recombination at grain boundaries.  We fabricated   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}-\\mathrm{DS}}$   solar cells on both flexible and rigid substrates using identical condition, including  the spin-coating procedure, annealing temperature and time,  etc. The XRD patterns reveal that the   $\\mathrm{\\MAP{bl}_{3}–\\mathrm{DS}}$   deposited  on glass/ITO/  ${\\mathrm{Yb}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}_{5}$   substrate displays lower intensity of (110)  peak with wider full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.22  than that of   $\\mathrm{PET/ITO/Nb_{2}O_{5}/M A P b I_{3}-D S}$  with the narrow  FWHM of 0.19 at the same location, as shown in Figure S8a  (Supporting Information), indicating that the MAPbI 3 –DS  exhibits inferior crystalline quality when deposited on the rigid  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/e85c9155c02e5fdc240abdc2a66428ce8a02b2e474363117c4c2c59a441042fc-1727118085.jpg)  \nFigure 2.   a) Illustration of the F-PSC structure. b) Cross-sectional SEM image of a completed flexible device with the   $\\mathsf{M A P b}|_{3}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{D S}$   absorber. c)  $J^{-V}$    curves of F-PSCs under both reverse and forward scan directions using   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   and MAPbI 3 –DS as the absorber layer. d) Stable current density and  PCE of the F-PSCs based on   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$   and   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$  –DS measured when the device was biased at 0.84 and  $0.88\\;\\lor,$   respectively. e) The PCEs of flexible  device based on   $\\mathsf{M A P b}|_{3}\\mathrm{-}\\mathsf{D S}$   at different bending curvature radii after 5000 flexing cycles.  \n\nTable 1.  $\\mathsf{k e y}J\\mathrm{-}V$   parameters of the F-PSCs. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/25172e7dbf8e58b2377cb42d1cfe1633d970b5490800f4eee08493962fbead22-1727118068.jpg)  \na) The active area of the cell is  $0.052\\;{\\sf c m}^{2}$   for F-PSCs.  \n\nsubstrate using the same condition.

In order to form high film quality on rigid substrates, the deposition conditions need further optimization,  as demonstrated in the previous work.  It is well-known that  the performance of perovskite solar cells strongly depends on  the crystalline quality of the perovskite absorber layer, which is  closely related to the annealing process, including temperature  and annealing time. It is apparent that the glass substrate needs  more time   $(\\approx\\!7\\,\\mathrm{min})$  ) than that of PET   $({\\approx}3\\ \\mathrm{min})$  ) to reach   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ,  as shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). Therefore, in  order to improve the crystalline quality of the perovskite layer\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ITO<|>Reagent<|>Indium tin oxide, used as a transparent electrode in the solar cell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PET<|>Substrate<|>Polyethylene terephthalate, used as a flexible substrate for the solar cell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F-PSCs<|>Product<|>Flexible perovskite solar cells, the final product of the synthesis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MgF2<|>Reagent<|>Magnesium fluoride, used to reduce optical reflection in the solar cell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DS<|>Reagent<|>Dopant solution, used to modify the perovskite films and improve the performance of the solar cell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pb<|>Reagent<|>Lead, a component of the perovskite material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPbI3<|>Reagent<|>Methylammonium lead iodide, a perovskite material used in the solar cell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Annealing<|>Reaction condition<|>Process of heating the perovskite material to improve its crystalline quality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Spin-coating<|>Synthesis method<|>Method used to deposit the perovskite material on the substrate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XRD<|>Characterization technique<|>X-ray diffraction, used to analyze the crystalline structure of the perovskite material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEM<|>Characterization technique<|>Scanning electron microscopy, used to observe the morphology of the perovskite material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>J-V<|>Characterization technique<|>Current density-voltage, used to measure the electrical performance of the solar cell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PCE<|>Performance parameter<|>Power conversion efficiency, a measure of the solar cell's efficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Jsc<|>Performance parameter<|>Short-circuit current density, a measure of the solar cell's current output)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Voc<|>Performance parameter<|>Open-circuit voltage, a measure of the solar cell's voltage output)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FF<|>Performance parameter<|>Fill factor, a measure of the solar cell's efficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITO thickness<|>Morphology control factor<|>Thickness of the ITO layer, affects the transmittance and conductivity of the solar cell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DS volume ratio<|>Morphology control factor<|>Ratio of DS to solvent, affects the performance of the solar cell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Annealing temperature<|>Reaction condition<|>Temperature at which the perovskite material is annealed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Annealing time<|>Reaction condition<|>Duration of the annealing process)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITO<|>F-PSCs<|>ITO is used as a transparent electrode in the F-PSCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PET<|>F-PSCs<|>PET is used as a flexible substrate for the F-PSCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MgF2<|>F-PSCs<|>MgF2 is used to reduce optical reflection in the F-PSCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DS<|>F-PSCs<|>DS is used to modify the perovskite films and improve the performance of the F-PSCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Pb<|>MAPbI3<|>Pb is a component of MAPbI3<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAPbI3<|>F-PSCs<|>MAPbI3 is used as the absorber layer in the F-PSCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Annealing<|>MAPbI3<|>Annealing is used to improve the crystalline quality of MAPbI3<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Spin-coating<|>MAPbI3<|>Spin-coating is used to deposit MAPbI3 on the substrate<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XRD<|>MAPbI3<|>XRD is used to analyze the crystalline structure of MAPbI3<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEM<|>MAPbI3<|>SEM is used to observe the morphology of MAPbI3<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>J-V<|>F-PSCs<|>J-V is used to measure the electrical performance of the F-PSCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PCE<|>F-PSCs<|>PCE is a measure of the F-PSCs' efficiency<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Jsc<|>F-PSCs<|>Jsc is a measure of the F-PSCs' current output<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Voc<|>F-PSCs<|>Voc is a measure of the F-PSCs' voltage output<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FF<|>F-PSCs<|>FF is a measure of the F-PSCs' efficiency<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITO thickness<|>Transmittance<|>ITO thickness affects the transmittance of the solar cell<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITO thickness<|>Conductivity<|>ITO thickness affects the conductivity of the solar cell<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DS volume ratio<|>PCE<|>DS volume ratio affects the PCE of the solar cell<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Annealing temperature<|>Crystalline quality<|>Annealing temperature affects the crystalline quality of the perovskite material<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Annealing time<|>Crystalline quality<|>Annealing time affects the crystalline quality of the perovskite material<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
