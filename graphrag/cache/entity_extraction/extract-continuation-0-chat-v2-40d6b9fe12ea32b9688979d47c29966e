Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface.

OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The SNO nanosheets  were prepared by shaking the TBAOH-containing solution under  room temperature for 10 days, then washed three times with distilled  water and collected by cent ri fuga tion. Before any characterization and  measurement, (TBA)SNO sheets were dispersed on substrates and then  kept under UV exposure to burn out residual  ${\\mathsf{T}}{\\mathsf{B}}{\\mathsf{A}}^{+}$  .  \n\nCharacterization of SNO Samples : The size and morphology of  exfoliated SNO nanosheets were investigated by field-emission SEM  (Zeiss Sigma). The AFM measurement was conducted on a Bruker  Dimension Edge atomic force microscope. High-resolution morphology  and structure of SNO nanosheets were characterized by TEM (JOEL JEM2100F). A Bruker D8-A25 diffract o meter was used for the crystal structure  analysis of powder samples using Cu   $\\mathsf{K}\\alpha$  radiation   $(\\lambda=1.5405\\,\\mathrm{~\\AA~})$  ),  while GIXRD was performed for SNO nanosheets on a Rigaku  Smartlab9 diffract o meter. The XPS test was carried out using a PHI  5300 ESCA system   $(\\mathsf{M g},\\ ]4\\ \\mathsf{k V},\\,250\\ \\mathsf{W})$  ). UV–vis spectra were obtained  by measuring dispersed SNO nanosheets on quartz substrate using a  UV–vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900H). The room-temperature  PL and TRPL emission spectra were obtained on an Edinburgh FS5  spec tro flu oro meter. Temperature-dependent PL emission spectra were  measured by a LabRAM HR800 spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon).  \n\nPhotoelectric Measurements : The SNO-based PDs on  $\\mathsf{S i}/\\mathsf{S i O}_{2}$   substrate  were fabricated by photolithography, electron beam deposition of  metal contacts (  $\\mathsf{T S5/50\\ n m\\ C r/A u})$  , and subsequent lift-off process. The  photolithography was conducted on a Heidelberg  $\\upmu\\mathsf{P G}$   501 direct writer  system. After lift-off, fabricated devices were annealed at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  in Ar  atmosphere for  $2~\\mathsf{h}$  . For the construction of flexible SNO PDs, a shadow  mask was used for patterning of   $\\mathsf{C r/A u}$   contacts. All the electric and  photoelectric measurements were conducted using a semiconductor  characterization system (Keithley 4200, USA) and a four-probe station. A  450 W Xenon lamp equipped with a monochromator was utilized as the  light source whose power density was measured with a NOVA II power  meter (OPHIR Photonics). For pulse response characterization, a digital  oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 5140B) and a   $355\\ \\mathsf{n m\\ N d}{\\mathsf{:Y A G}}$   pulsed  laser system with a pulse duration of 3–5 ns were used. Temperaturedependent transport properties were measured using a closed-cycle  helium compressor-cooled cryostat (HC-4E1, Sumitomo).  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors appreciate Dr. Weixin Ouyang, Jian Cai, Hong Zhu, and  Yajie Yan for their kind support to this work.
