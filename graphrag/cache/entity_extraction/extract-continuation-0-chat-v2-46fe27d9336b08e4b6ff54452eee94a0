Here, we review these factors that  cause instability of MHP materials. We categorizeÂ  the instability in PeLEDs into two types; i.e.,Â instability of: (i) the MHP  materials and (ii) the constituent layers and interfaces in PeLED  devices. Then, we critically review recent studies that have tried  to improve the stability of MHP materials and PeLEDs. Based  on advances made in these studies, we present insight toward  future research directions and an outlook of PeLEDs for practical applications.  \n\n# 2. Origins of the Low Stability of PeLEDs  \n\n# 2.1. Intrinsic Instability of MHP Materials  \n\nMany MHP materials undergo significant changes in structural and op to electronic properties under phase transitions,  thermal stress, air exposure, and illumination; some previous  review papers have reported these instabilities of MHPs. However, such reviews have mainly focused on applications of  MHPs in solar cells. In this section, we review previous reports  about the intrinsic instability of MHPs, with a focus on how  this instability affects the luminescence properties of MHPs.  Also, we review instability of MHP NPs in the solution and  film states.  \n\n# 2.1.1. Influence of the Crystal Structure on Stability  \n\nMHPs can generally have three crystal structures: cubic,  tetragonal, and ortho rhombi c, which can be transformed  into eachÂ other reversibly by temperature change or chemical  exchange of halide anions. The cubic perovskite structure is  highly symmetric and thermodynamic ally more stable than  the tetragonal and ortho rhombi c perovskite structures because  of the lowest formation energy among three structures. TheÂ structure of MHPs can be determined by calculating the  tolerance factor  \n\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{f}}={\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{A}}+R_{\\mathrm{X}}}{{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{B}}+R_{\\mathrm{X}}\\right)}}\n$$  \n\nand the octahedral factor  \n\n$$\no_{\\mathrm{c}}={\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{B}}}{R_{\\mathrm{X}}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $R_{\\mathrm{{A}}},\\ R_{\\mathrm{{B}}}$  , and   $R_{X}$   are the effective radii of the A, B,  and   $\\mathrm{X}$   ions, respectively.  MHPs have cubic structure   $(P m3m)$   when   $0.813\\protect\\leq t_{\\mathrm{f}}\\protect\\leq1.107$   and   $0.442\\leq o_{\\mathsf{c}}\\leq0.895$  ;  otherÂ­ wise it has a tetragonal   $(I4/m c m)$   or ortho rhombi c   $(P n a2_{1})$   structure. Therefore, it is very important to control  the radii of the constituent ions to make a stable cubic perovskite structure. Considering the effective radii of halogen  anions (  $\\cdot\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$  : 167 pm;   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$  : 182 pm; I â : 206 pm),   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   have cubic structure and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PeLEDs<|>Product<|>Perovskite
