CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Here, we review these factors that  cause instability of MHP materials. We categorize  the instability in PeLEDs into two types; i.e., instability of: (i) the MHP  materials and (ii) the constituent layers and interfaces in PeLED  devices. Then, we critically review recent studies that have tried  to improve the stability of MHP materials and PeLEDs. Based  on advances made in these studies, we present insight toward  future research directions and an outlook of PeLEDs for practical applications.  \n\n# 2. Origins of the Low Stability of PeLEDs  \n\n# 2.1. Intrinsic Instability of MHP Materials  \n\nMany MHP materials undergo significant changes in structural and op to electronic properties under phase transitions,  thermal stress, air exposure, and illumination; some previous  review papers have reported these instabilities of MHPs. However, such reviews have mainly focused on applications of  MHPs in solar cells. In this section, we review previous reports  about the intrinsic instability of MHPs, with a focus on how  this instability affects the luminescence properties of MHPs.  Also, we review instability of MHP NPs in the solution and  film states.  \n\n# 2.1.1. Influence of the Crystal Structure on Stability  \n\nMHPs can generally have three crystal structures: cubic,  tetragonal, and ortho rhombi c, which can be transformed  into each other reversibly by temperature change or chemical  exchange of halide anions. The cubic perovskite structure is  highly symmetric and thermodynamic ally more stable than  the tetragonal and ortho rhombi c perovskite structures because  of the lowest formation energy among three structures. The structure of MHPs can be determined by calculating the  tolerance factor  \n\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{f}}={\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{A}}+R_{\\mathrm{X}}}{{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(R_{\\mathrm{B}}+R_{\\mathrm{X}}\\right)}}\n$$  \n\nand the octahedral factor  \n\n$$\no_{\\mathrm{c}}={\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{B}}}{R_{\\mathrm{X}}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $R_{\\mathrm{{A}}},\\ R_{\\mathrm{{B}}}$  , and   $R_{X}$   are the effective radii of the A, B,  and   $\\mathrm{X}$   ions, respectively.  MHPs have cubic structure   $(P m3m)$   when   $0.813\\protect\\leq t_{\\mathrm{f}}\\protect\\leq1.107$   and   $0.442\\leq o_{\\mathsf{c}}\\leq0.895$  ;  other­ wise it has a tetragonal   $(I4/m c m)$   or ortho rhombi c   $(P n a2_{1})$   structure. Therefore, it is very important to control  the radii of the constituent ions to make a stable cubic perovskite structure. Considering the effective radii of halogen  anions (  $\\cdot\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$  : 167 pm;   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$  : 182 pm; I − : 206 pm),   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   have cubic structure and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PeLEDs<|>Product<|>Perovskite
