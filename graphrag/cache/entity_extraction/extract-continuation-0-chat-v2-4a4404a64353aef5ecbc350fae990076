OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

The   $q,\\ m,$  , and   $n$   charge  states are defined as   $q=m\\,+\\,n$  . The combinations satisfying  the condition   $q=m+n$   are summarized in  Table   1 . Based on  the Table  1 data, there are three decomposition pathways for   $\\mathrm{Pb}_{\\mathrm{Br}}^{-1}$  . In the case of the   $\\mathrm{Pb_{Br}}$   antisite,   $\\mathrm{Br_{i}}$   and   $\\mathrm{Br_{Pb}}$   can decompose to  ${\\mathrm{V_{Pb}}}$  ,   ${\\mathrm{V_{Br}}}$   and  $\\mathrm{{Pb}_{\\mathrm{{i}}}}$  .   $\\mathrm{Br_{i}}$   in oxidation state  $+1$   was shown to  have a narrow stable region for overwhelming p-type doping. \n\n  $\\mathrm{Br_{Pb}}$   defect complexes, such as   $\\mathrm{Br}_{\\mathrm{Pb}}^{+3}$    and   $\\mathrm{Br}_{\\mathrm{Pb}}^{+2}$   , decompose to \n\n  $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{Br}}^{+1}$   , and either   $\\mathrm{{Pb}_{i}^{+1}}$    or   $\\mathrm{{Pb}_{i}^{+2}}$   . The major deep defect,   $\\mathrm{{Pb}_{\\mathrm{{i}}}}$  , can  change to dimerized   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   atoms or   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$   cations in the deep electron trapping region. In the case of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$  ,  halide vacancies were also observed, and these formed deep  defect levels. The   $\\sf P b_{I}^{0}$   antisite in   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   does not changed to   $\\mathrm{V_{Pb}}$   and   $\\mathrm{I_{i}}$  . In excess halide conditions in the   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX_{3}}$   system,  for example, the creation of deep-trap levels is prevented by  addition of   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{2}$   or HX.  \n\nConsequently, the reaction enthalpies of the HMHP precursors shed light on the stability of the HMHP materials. A zero  reaction enthalpy indicates a dynamic equilibrium between the  initial precursors and final HMHP crystal. A higher enthalpy  in the exothermic reaction   $\\mathrm{PbX}_{2}\\,+\\,\\mathrm{MAX}\\,\\rightarrow\\,\\mathrm{MAPbX}_{3}$   implies  a higher stability of the formed HMHP crystal. The reaction  enthalpy is given by Equation (4)  \n\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{HMHF}}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{lead\\,hadde}}^{\\mathrm{solid}}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{MA\\,hadde}}^{\\mathrm{solid}}\n$$  \n\nThe calculated reaction enthalpies for   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\mathrm{{MA}}I_{3}}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  ,  and   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$   are  − 0.1,  $-0.25$  , and   $-0.7\\;\\mathrm{eV},$  , respectively.  \n\nBased on these theoretical approaches, the general compositions of HMHP materials for solar cell devices should be investigated. Mixed halides have been used as light absorbers, for  example,   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   with a fraction of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$  ,  for high-efficiency solar cells. Furthermore, in   $\\mathrm{FrobI}_{3}$   systems,  mixed halides with A-site cations have also been prepared, and  these light-absorbing materials are often used in high-efficiency  solar cells. There are many reports on the segregation of halides and A-site cations formed together in bulk materials. In  this case, it is challenging to define the defect formation mechanism. Before addressing this, the specific roles and effects of  the addition of each halide on the nucleation growth of HMHPs  need to be firstly identified. If these effects on the formation are  determined, new approaches for device and material stabilization can be devised. Fortunately, the mixed   $C s^{+}$   and   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   cation  HMHPs discussed in Section  2.1 can be re investigated with  respect to the thermodynamic relationship of   $\\alpha$   and   $\\delta\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$  phases with  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\cal I}_{3}$  .  \n\n# 3.2. Dissociation of Methyl ammonium  \n\nThe   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation is the most used cation in HMHP materials  such as   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{(FA^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}\\,\\ m i x e d})\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  , (guan id in i um \n\n  $\\mathsf{G U}^{+[91-93]}$   and   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}\\,m i x e d}\\}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$  , and   $\\mathrm{(Cs^{+}}$  ,  $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$  , and   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   mixed)\n\n  ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{3}$  . As mentioned above, the role of  $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   in HMHPs has been  identified as a particular influence on the stability of   $\\alpha{\\mathrm{F}}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{P}{\\mathrm{bl}}_{3}$  ,  for example, that of   $\\mathrm{FA^{+}}$   and   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   mixed cations in HMHPs.  Many previous works have addressed unstable   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and  its use in solar cell devices.  Thus, the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation has a  critical effect on the crystal stability of   $\\mathrm{Frob}_{3}$  , and hence, the  reason for the chemical instability of the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation must be  understood. The intrinsic degradation processes of HMHP  materials are also significant, contributing to the de stabilization  of   $\\mathscr{\\alpha}\\mathrm{FAPbI}_{3}$   crystals (or films).  \n\nThe decomposition of MA was reported many years ago.  In 1935, the kinetics of the thermal decomposition of MA  was reported by Emeléus and Jolley.  Cullis and co-workers  reported the thermal oxidation of MA in 1951.  In 1979, the  decomposition rate of chemically activated methyl amine was  reported by Chao and co-workers.  In 1992, Johnson and  co-workers reported the che mi sorption and thermal decomposition of MA on the   $\\mathrm{{Ru}}(001)$   surface.  Very recently, concerning HMHPs, Delugas, and co-workers  investigated  MA fragmentation. First, the electronic structure and energy  levels of each chemical and ionic bonding states of the MA  cation were investigated. The DOS of the electronic state of  the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation in the ideal   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$   structure has been calculated, as shown in  Figure    6 .
