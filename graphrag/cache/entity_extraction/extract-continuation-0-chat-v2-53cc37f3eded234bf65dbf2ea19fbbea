CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Inset shows the corresponding electroluminescence (EL) spectrum at  $2.5\\,\\lor.$   b) Plot of external electroluminescence quantum efficiency   $(\\mathsf E Q\\mathsf E_{\\mathsf E L})$  versus current density. Inset shows the   $\\mathsf{E Q E}_{\\mathsf{E L}}$   of  $\\mathrm{\\Omega}\\approx\\mathrm{\\Omega}.5\\%$   at a driving current equal to the short-circuit current of the device. Evolution of the  $\\mathsf{E Q E}_{\\mathsf{E L}}$   for  the un encapsulated quasi-2D perovskite LED measured under an air atmosphere of   ${\\approx}37\\%$   RH at a constant current density of c)   $200\\textsf{m A c m}^{-2}$   and  d)  $1000\\textsf{m A c m}^{-2}$  .  \n\n$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{oc,nonrad}}$  , a predicted   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.24~\\mathrm{V}$   is obtained, confirming the  value of   $1.23~\\mathrm{V}$   measured from the  $J{-}V$  curve.  \n\nFurthermore, the   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   of the solar cell device reaches up  to   $3.85\\%$   at a high current density of   $342~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   (Figure 4b)  and a high brightness of 68.4  W   $\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{\\textrm{m}}^{-2}$   (Figure  4a). The  quasi-2D perovskite LED shows a low efficiency roll-off at high  driving current density. The   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   value has almost no roll-off  at  $500\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   and remains   $50\\%$   of its peak even at an enormous injection current density of   $1880~\\mathrm{mA}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . We evaluate  the operation stability of the un encapsulated LED devices under  an air atmosphere with relative humidity of   ${\\approx}37\\%$  . As shown in  Figure 4c,d, an enhancement of the   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   can be observed in  the first few hours of device operation. We believe this is probably resulting from two reasons: 1) a slow trap-filling process  by the injected carriers and/or ionic motion; 2) a slow internal  field-redistribution due to local ionic motion of excess ions  under external electric field.  The device   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   decays to  half of the initial value after   ${\\approx}96\\$   h of continuous operation at  a given current density of   $200\\ \\mathrm{mA}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , creating a new record  of operation lifetime for perovskite LEDs, and even better than  the best performing near infrared organic LEDs.  For a  higher injection current density of   $1000\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , the operation  lifetime of quasi-2D perovskite LED still reaches an impressed   $5.35\\mathrm{~h~}$  . Our results suggest that the good stability of the LED  devices can be attributed to the intrinsic stability of quasi-2D  perovskite films with high crystal lin it y and a low level of defects.  \n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that high performance  solar cells and LEDs can be achieved by using 3BBAI based  quasi-2D perovskite film. The film has a layered structure of  vertically oriented small $\\cdot n$   per ovsk ites covered by a layer of  oriented large $_{,n}$   components. This unique micro structure leads  to form an energetically ordered and highly crystalline perovs­ kite film with good charge transport, suppressed non radiative  recombination, and excellent moisture resistance. Our results  suggest that 3BBAI based quasi-2D perovskite materials are  ideal for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cell, LEDs  and other op to electronic applications, and tuning the growth of  2D perovskite films is a key step toward achieving this goal.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nSynthesis and Materials Preparation : 3BBAI was synthesized by adding  hydroiodic acid (1 mmol) into a solution of   $m$  -Br-benz yl amine (1 mmol)  in ethanol   $(20~\\mathsf{m L})$   at   $0~^{\\circ}\\mathsf C$  and then stirred for   $2~\\mathsf{h}$  . Next, the solution  was evaporated at   $60~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   to obtain precipitates, which were washed  three times with diethyl ether and then vacuum-dried at   $35~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for   $\\mathsf{T}2\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathsf{h}$  .  Precursor solution were prepared by dissolving 3BBAI, MACl, and   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  in DMF with different molar ratio in DMF at a weight concentration of   $20\\%$   and stirring at  $60~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $8\\;\\mathsf{h}$   in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.  \n\nDevice Fabrication : ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned  sequentially in acetone and alcohol, followed by   $10~\\mathsf{m i n}$   oxygen plasma  treatment. The substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove  box for the further fabrication steps. A hole-transport layer of PTAA  (molecular weight:   $1000{\\scriptstyle{-10}}\\,000{\\mathrm{\\g\\}}{\\mathsf{m o}}^{|{\\mathrm{-}}1})$  ) from a chl oro benzene solution \n\n  $(6~\\mathsf{m g\\,m L^{-1}})$  ) was spin-coated onto the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate  at 5000  rpm for   $30\\,\\mathrm{~s~}$   and annealed at   $100~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . After the  substrates were heated to a temperature of   $\\ ]40\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  , the perovskite films  were deposited by hot-casting the precursor solution onto the substrates  at 5000  rpm for   $20~s$   and annealed at   $90~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $15\\,\\mathrm{\\mum}$  . An electrontransport layer of  $\\mathsf{P C}_{61}\\,\\mathsf{B M}$   was deposited from a chl oro benzene solution   $(20\\ \\mathsf{m g\\ m L^{-1}})$   at 1000 rpm for   $60~\\mathrm{s}$  . Finally, the Cr and Au layers were  deposited using a thermal evaporation system through a shadow mask  under a base pressure o  $\\mathsf{f}\\approx\\mathsf{6}\\times\\mathsf{10^{-7}}$   Torr. The device area was  $0.03\\;{\\sf c m}^{2}$   as  defined by the overlapping area of the ITO film and top electrode.  \n\nDevice Characterization : All perovskite solar cells were measured  under simulated  $\\mathsf{A M I}.5\\textsf{G}$   irradiation at   $100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   by using a solar  simulator (Class AAA, SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) and current–voltage curves  were recorded by a Keithley 2450 source meter. The light intensity was  calibrated by using a Newport standard silicon cell 91150. The devices  were swept from zero bias to forward bias with scan rate of   $0.02\\ \\mathsf{V}\\ \\mathsf{s}^{-1}$  .
