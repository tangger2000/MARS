CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer.

According to the study by McGehee  et al.,  the energy band of   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide perovskite   $(\\mathrm{ABX}_{3})$  is determined by the  $p$   and  s  orbitals of B site and X site. As  the Sn content increases, the compression and distortion of  the perovskite crystal lattice further lead to changes in the  bandgap (Figure 5d). However, the exact origin of this bowing  effect is still under debate.  \n\nA recent density functional theory (DFT) calculation study  by Goyal et al. indicates that the nonlinear bandgap changing  tendency results from the energy mismatch between   $s/p$  atomic orbitals of Sn and   $\\mathrm{Pb}$   that form the band edges of the  alloy (Figure 5e).  Due to the less bound atomic orbitals of  Sn that form the bands, both the edges of CB and VB are less  bound in Sn-based perovskite relative to Pb-based analogs.  This indicates that the Sn-derived valence band maximum  (VBM) and Pb-derived conduction band minimum (CBM)  \n\ndelimit the range of the bandgap of the alloy. As a result, the  bandgap becomes lower than that of either pure compounds  (Figure 5f).  \n\n# 3.2. Morphology of Mixed Pb–Sn Halide Per ovsk ites  \n\nThe mixed   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{Sn}$   halide perovskite films usually showed  better surface coverage than the tin halide perovskite films.  The morphology and film quality play a crucial role in  determining the performance of solar cells. Perovskite films  with inadequate surface coverage and a high density of pinholes suffer from severe charge recombination loss and a high  risk of shunting. The morphology of low-bandgap per ovsk ites  film is mainly adjusted by changing A- and B-site cations.  \n\nFigure    6 a shows   $\\mathrm{MAN}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Pb}_{0.5}\\mathrm{I}_{3}$   perovskite film deposited  on mesoporous   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  .

As the proportion of Sn increases, the regulation of the morphology for low-bandgap per ovsk ites is  more complicated.
