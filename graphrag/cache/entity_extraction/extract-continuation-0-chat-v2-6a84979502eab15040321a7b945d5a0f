The same nomenclature, HEOs,  has been used here. HEOs are located at  the center of a multinary phase diagram,  which is often the least explored realm of  materials compositions, therefore unexpected behaviors can be anticipated.   The formation of chemically complex,  single-phase HEOs is noteworthy, since  enthalpy-dominated phase separation is a  common scenario in most of the complex  multinary systems. Investigations into  these new material classes have already  resulted in many unexpected and inter  \n\nHigh-entropy materials, especially high-entropy alloys and oxides, have  gained significant interest over the years due to their unique structural  characteristics and correlated possibilities for tailoring of functional properties. The developments in the area of high-entropy oxides are highlighted  here, with emphasis placed on their fundamental understanding, including  entropy-dominated phase-stabilization effects and prospective applications,  e.g., in the field of electrochemical energy storage. Critical comments on the  different classes of high-entropy oxides are made and the underlying principles for the observed properties are summarized. The diversity of materials  design, provided by the entropy-mediated phase-stabilization concept, allows  engineering of new oxide candidates for practical applications, warranting  further studies in this emerging field of materials science.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nesting findings. Considering the increasing attention being paid  to this promising design concept of oxides, the recent results  and achievements in the field of HEOs are highlighted in this  research news article.  \n\nOne of the fundamental driving forces in materials science is the  development of advanced materials with tailorable properties.  A new concept of materials design, rendering the possibility to  affect the phase stability of solid solutions through precise control of configuration al entropy, has evolved with the discovery of  high entropy alloys (HEAs).  More recently, the field of high  entropy materials has been broadened to include different groups  of nonmetallic compounds, like oxides,  carbides,  borides   nitrides,  and sulfides.  Rost et  al. discovered the possibility  to incorporate five different cations, in equiatomic ratios, into a  single-phase oxide system and defined this as “entropy-stabilized  oxide” due to the clear evidence of an entropy-driven structural  stabilization effect.

For HEOs, the contribution of the anion site is  expected to only have a minor effect on   $S_{\\mathrm{config}},$  , given that only  one anion is present (i.e., the effect of possible oxygen vacancies is not considered).   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$   in an   $N$  -components solid solution  (with   $N=2$  , 3, 4, or 5) as a function of the mole fraction of the  N th component is plotted in  Figure   1 a.  It can be observed that   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$   increases with the addition of more elements to a given  system. Furthermore,   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$   reaches a maximum when all elements are present in equiatomic fractions (Figure  1a). In an  equiatomic 5-cation system, the maximum   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$   value that can  be achieved is  $1.61\\;\\mathrm{R}$  . As per empirical classification, based on its  configuration al entropy introduced by Murty et al.,  materials  with   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}\\geq1.5~\\mathrm{R}$   can be classified as “high entropy”, materials  with   $1.5~\\mathrm{R}>S_{\\mathrm{config}}\\geq1$   R as “medium entropy” and materials with   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}<1$   R as “low entropy” systems. The dependency of the  free energy of mixing   $(\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}})$   on the enthalpy of mixing   $(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}})$  and the entropy of mixing   $(\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}})$   is presented in Equation (2).  \n\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}=\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}-T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}\n$$  \n\nIn many cases, a single phase is achieved if   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}\\geq1.5\\,\\mathrm{\\tiny~R},$  ,  as then the   $T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$   can be large enough to dominate the free  energy landscape and overcome  $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$  . This emphasizes the fact  that high temperatures are beneficial in the formation of high or  medium entropy (single-phase) systems; at room temperature,  many these systems must be considered metastable. However,  several studies have already shown that this criterion   $(S_{\\mathrm{config}}\\geq$  1.5 R) does not guarantee the formation of a single-phase material.  In many cases, the configuration al entropy gain is not  enough to compensate for   $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$   and, as a result, intermediate  products with more favorable formation enthalpies are produced.  Still, in most of the research on multi component  near-equiatomic systems the term “high entropy” is commonly  used, as there is an assured   $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$   gain (following Boltzmann’s  entropy Equation (1)) with addition of more elements.  \n\n# 2.2. Structural Features of High-Entropy Oxides  \n\nInitial studies on HEOs concentrated on systems with a rock-salt  structure, consisting of only one Wyckoff site for the cations.  The first investigated system of this materials class was   $\\mathrm{(Cu_{0.2}C u_{0.2}M g_{0.2}N i_{0.2}Z n_{0.2})O^{[3]}}$   and, for simplicity, here it is  termed rock-salt type HEO (R-HEO). X-ray diffraction (XRD)  measurements on R-HEO and corresponding structural analysis confirmed the crystallization of a single-phase rock-salt  structure, as shown in Figure  1b.  The range of HEOs  has since widened to include a single-phase fluorite structure,  resulting from the incorporation of five (or more) equiatomic  cations, mostly rare-earth elements, here termed fluorite type  HEO (F-HEO); see Figure  1c.  However, both R-HEO  and F-HEO comprise only one Wyckoff site for the cations\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>High-Entropy Oxides<|>Material<|>A
