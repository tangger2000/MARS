In recent years, various piezoelectric materials including ZnO,  GaN,   and numerous piezoelectric perovskite  ceramics such as   $\\mathrm{BaTiO}_{3}{}^{[4]}$   have been synthesized to construct PENGs. However,  fabrication and growth of such inorganic  nano materials is complicated, and involves  cost-intensive processing and high growth  temperature. Also they have specific deformations to very small range because of  their rigid and brittle nature. Therefore, it  is urgent to develop the materials that are  easy to synthesize, inexpensive, and excellent in performance to assemble (PENGs). Recently, the newly emerging lead  halide per ovsk ites   $(\\mathrm{ABX}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{~\\textit~{~A~}~}=$  organic  group or inorganic ion,   $\\mathrm{~B~}=\\mathrm{~Pb~}$  , and   $\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Cl}$  , Br, or I), have received extensive  attention in op to electronic devices such  \n\nInorganic lead halide perovskite has become an emerging material for modern  photoelectric and electronic nano devices due to its excellent optical and  electronic properties. In view of its huge dielectric and electrical properties,  inorganic  $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}$   perovskite is introduced into the piezoelectric nano generator  (PENG). Based on one-step electro spinning of solutions containing   $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}$    precursors and polyvinyl ide ne difluoride (PVDF), in situ growth of  $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}$    nano crystals in PVDF fibers   $(\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}\\emptyset\\mathsf{P V D F}$   composite fibers) with highly  uniform size and spatial distribution are synthesized. The  $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}@$  PVDF  composite fibers based PENG reveals an open-circuit voltage   $(V_{\\infty})$   of  $\\mathbf{\\bar{\\eta}}\\mathbf{\\mathfrak{d}}\\mathbf{\\nu}$    and a density of short-circuit current  $(I_{s c})$   of   $170\\,\\upmu\\mathsf{A}\\,\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  , where the   $V_{\\infty}$   is  comparable to the state-of-the-art hybrid composite piezoelectric nano generators  (PENGs) and the density of  $I_{s c}$   is 4.86 times higher than that of lead halide  per ovsk ites counterpart ever reported. Moreover,   $\\mathsf{C s P b B r}_{3}\\mathrm{@P V D F}$   composite  fibers based PENG exhibits fundamentally improved thermal/water/acid–base  st abilities. This study suggests that the   $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}\\textcircled{o}$  PVDF composite fiber is a  good candidate for fabricating high-performance PENGs, promising application  potentials in mechanical energy harvesting and motion sensing technologies.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nas photovoltaics, photodetector s, light emitting diode, and laser  diodes, due to their advantages of high photoelectric conversion  efficiency, high photo luminescence quantum efficiency, superior electrical properties, tunable emission wavelength, and  high color purity.  Specially,   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbI}_{3}$   perovskite has been  reported with excellent piezoelectric properties (output piezoelectric of  $2.7\\;\\mathrm{V}$   and   $140\\;\\mathrm{nA}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  ).  The lead halide per ovsk ites  are becoming the potential materials suitable for assembling  PENGs for energy collection and conversion. In comparison  to the hybrid lead halide per ovsk ites, the all-inorganic counterparts are more stable while possessing performance comparable to that.  However, intrinsic ionic character makes the  lead halide per ovsk ites very sensitive toward thermal, water,  and acid–base.  Their intrinsic poor stability greatly limits the  practical applications.  \n\nAs a familiar method of mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion in our life, piezoelectric effect is always considered as a  promising solution to the energy crisis. Based on this effect,  \n\nOne of the effective routes to increase the stability of lead  halide per ovsk ites is to encapsulate the perovskite nano crystals  (NCs) within protecting matrices. The flexible polymer is the  most suitable candidate material, which not only prevents the  agglomeration of perovskite NCs but also buffers the per ovsk ites  from the thermal, water, and acid–base of the environments.   Piezoelectric polymer such as polyvinyl ide ne difluoride (PVDF)  can be a promising candidate as polymer matrix for piezoelectric  composite nano generators owing to their excellent piezoelectric  properties, remarkable flexibility, and high thermal stability.   PVDF is a type of semi-crystalline polymer which consists of at  least four kinds of crystalline phases, that is,   $\\alpha,\\,\\beta,\\,\\gamma$   and   $\\delta$   in  different lattice type and chain conformation. Among them,   $\\beta$    phase can be used as polymer matrix due to the highest piezoelectric coefficient of  $-29\\;\\mathrm{pm}\\;\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$  .  \n\nIn this work, a high-performance PENG based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@$  PVDF composite fibers is constructed by in situ growth method.  After thermal annealing and electric field polarization pretreatment, piezoelectric output signal of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{PVDF}$   composite  fibers based PENG is measured under horizontal mechanical  compression and release. The maximum open-circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   and the density of short-circuit current   $\\left(I_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\right)$   are obtained  to be   $103~\\mathrm{V}$   and  $170\\;\\upmu\\mathrm{A}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , respectively. The energy generated  by the PENG can be used to charge capacitors. Also, PENG can  act as a sensor for motion under harsh environment, including  high temperature, humidity, and corrosive condition. All these  results show that the inorganic perovskite has a great potential  of simplicity and efficiency in high-performance piezoelectric  energy acquisition and sensor devices.  \n\n# 2.
