CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The maximum voltage  for the devices with   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   is   $0.98~\\mathrm{V},$   and the maximum current  density is  $23.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The corresponding steady-state output  PCE was   $22.74\\%$   (Figure   $4\\mathrm{c}$  ). The best-performing device was  sent to a PV calibration laboratory (Quality supervision and  Testing Center of Chemical and Physical Power Sources of  Information Industry, China) for certification. A certified efficiency of   $22.54\\%$   was demonstrated with a   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   of 1.16 V,   $J_{S C}$    of   $24.78\\mathrm{{\\mA\\cm}^{-2}}$  , and FF of   $78.23\\%$   (Figure S17, Supporting  Information), making it one of the best planar PSCs. A performance comparison with previous devices based on bilayer ETLs  can be found in Table S3 (Supporting Information).  \n\nThe stability of PSCs is one of the most important criteria for commercialization.  The device stability was tested  under a nitrogen environment   $(25\\ \\mathrm{~}^{o}\\mathrm{C})$   without encapsulation,  as shown in Figure  4d. After 80 days, the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -based  PSC still maintains   $97.5\\%$   of its initial PCE. Compared with   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based PSCs which retain only   $92.7\\%$   of their initial PCE,  our results verify the enhanced stability of the new device.  Figure 4e shows the normalized PCE changes over time. It is  obvious that after   $180\\textup{h}$   of continuous illumination, the device  based on the   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   bilayer maintains   ${\\approx}91\\%$   of its initial  efficiency. While for the same conditions, the device based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   maintains only   $83\\%$   of its initial efficiency. The stability  was also tested under ambient air (relative humidity (RH)   $75\\%)$  . After   $120\\textrm{h}$  , the devices based on   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   maintain   ${\\approx}80\\%$   of their initial efficiency and the devices based on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$    only provide  $71\\%$   of their initial efficiency under the same conditions (Figure  4f). The same conclusion was also confirmed  by thermal stability measurements (Figure S18, Supporting  Information). The instability of PSCs is due to the decomposition of perovskite materials and organic hole transport layer  (HTL). The grain size of perovskite films based on  $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$    is larger compared to that of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   (Figure 1). The larger grain  size of perovskite films may partly suppress the permeation of  water at grain boundaries and increase stability. We believe that  the stability of perovksite solar cells can be improved further  if new HTL materials  and/or encapsulation methods  are  used.  \n\nIn summary, a simple and effective   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   bilayer ETL  was developed for fabricating efficient low-temperature-processed planar PSCs. The presence of   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$   leads to low trap  densities in perovskite films, better energy alignment, and  enhanced charge transfer, which result in higher   $V_{\\mathrm{OC}}$   and FF.  Eventually, an optimized PCE of   $23.24\\%$   (certified   $22.54\\%)$   was  obtained with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the device based  on   $\\mathrm{In}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}/\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$   ETL retains   $97.5\\%$   of its initial efficiency after  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/e7640943df38d5005622367cb5b024adc72e8436b45050b68df0a04ae04d6a55-1727127439.jpg)  \nFigure 4.  $\\mathsf{I n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL. b) The corresponding EQE of the planar  structure PSC with   $\\mathsf{I n}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}/\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL.

This work demonstrates that a bilayer ETL can provide  sufficient energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer for  efficient and stable photovoltaic devices. The efficiency of PSCs  can be further improved by optimizing the energy alignment  between the interface layers.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : Lead iodide   $(\\mathsf{P b}|_{2})$  , bis(tri flu oro methyl s ulf on yl)-imide  lithium  salt  (Li-TFSI),  4- tert -but yl pyr i dine  (tBP)  chl oro benzene,  dimethyl s ulf oxide  (DMSO),  N , N -dimethyl form amide  (DMF),  and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich.
