What's more, no  obvious PL intensity deterioration was observed for   $53.4\\%$  maintenance of PLQYs after being stored for more than  40 day under ambient condition as shown in Figure 6e, which  verify the ultrahigh environmental stability of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  composites. Besides, the typical time trace measurement of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}@\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   displayed a minor decrease in fluorescence  intensity or oscillation following a Poisson intensity distribution with a continuous ON state, this non blinking character  is caused by surface sensitivity pass iv ation from   $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   shell as  well.

The robustly porous inorganic salts include mesoporous  silica, zeolites and some uniform   $\\mathrm{CaF}_{2}$   hierarchical nanospheres (HNSs) or magnesium silicate hollow spheres (MSHSs)  obtained by natural or artificial way. These porous inorganic salts  could localize PQDs in confined space inhibiting aggregation  \n\neffectively and act as protective layer against the attack of  oxygen or moisture by prohibiting the lattice disturbance or  degradation.  And dense inorganic ionic salts can provide  robust matrix for PQDs resulting in a remarkable improvement  of stability.  \n\nThe mesoporous silica composed by either pure silica or  a lumi no silicate, is one of the wide varieties of both natural and  synthetic inorganic salts exhibiting long-range ordered framework and high level of porosity over widely varying length  scales with diameters about   $2–50~\\mathrm{nm}$  .  Usually, there are  some well-known MS members such as MCM-41, MCM-48,  and SBA-15. The structure of MCM-41 is characterized by a  hexagonal packing of 1D channels with pore diameters ranging  from 20 to   $100\\textup{\\AA}$  .  The MCM-48 with cubic   $I a3d$   structure  has a bi continuous structure as two independent and intricately  interwoven networks of mesoporous channels. The SBA-15 is  a hexagonal silica with a larger pore size than MCM-41 and  thicker silica cell walls. As more and more mesoporous silicates  were reported successively, the complexity of MS materials  has greatly boomed the synthesis of PQDs.  Malgras et  al.  found quantum confinement effects of   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   QDs in  the MS matrix. By increasing the pores size, a gradual redshift  of PL was observed along with significant peak broadening  ( Figure    $\\mathrm{7a}$  ) and increasing PL lifetimes (Figure 7c). They also  embedded PQDs of different compositions inside the same MS  and found a clear change of color as displayed in Figure   $7\\mathrm{b}$  ,  which provides a direct evidence for the small variations of  band gap, confirming that most   $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SiO2<|>Precursor<|>Silicon
