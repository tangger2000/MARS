CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

In contrast, the average  open-circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   shows similar values for   $x=0$   to 10,  but increases progressively with increasing GAI proportions  from  $x=15$   to 30. The observed variations of  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   might  be due to the combined effects of bandgap energies   $(E_{\\mathrm{g}})$   and  the band alignment, for which the   $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$   values continuously  increase (favoring larger   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}})$   whereas the energy levels of the  VB shift continuously downward upon increasing GAI proportions (Figure 2d) for E1G10 and E1G20 devices for which the  energy levels match better with that of the PEDOT:PSS layer  (favoring larger   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}})$  . For the FF values, a systematic variation  on the FF was observed with the best value occurring at the  E1G20 cell. As a result, the device with the best performance is  the   $\\mathrm{CA}_{0.2}\\mathrm{FA}_{0.78}\\mathrm{SnI}_{3}–1\\%$     $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   (E1G20) cell that shows average  PCE  $7.4\\pm0.3\\%$   and the best cell PCE   $8.5\\%$  .  \n\nThe additive   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   plays an important role in the PV performance of our tin-based hybrid cation planar PSC. We hence  used the G20 cell as a reference to fabricate devices with   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$    in varied proportions from   $0.5\\%$   to   $2\\%$  . Figure S7 (Supporting  Information) shows   $J{-}V$  curves of the   $\\mathtt{Egamma G}20$   cells with   $\\gamma=0$  ,  0.5, 1, and 2. The poor performance of the G20 cell is obvious,  for which PCE was only   $0.5\\%$   because the perovskite layer has  a poor morphology containing many pinholes, according to  the top-view SEM shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). When the proportion of   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   was increased, the PV  performance enhanced substantially, from PCE   $3.4\\%$   (E0.5G20)  increasing to   $7.9\\%$  (E1G20), and then slightly decreasing to  PCE   $7.2\\%$   (E2G20). This poor performance of the G20 cell is  attributed to the poor film coverage that led to serious charge  recombination in the device.   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   hence plays an important role to passivate the surface defects, to control the film  morphology, and to suppress the oxidation of   $\\mathrm{Sn^{2+}}$   to   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  , as  reported elsewhere.  For our tin-based hybrid cation PSC  case, the optimized proportion of   $\\mathrm{EDAI}_{2}$   is   $1\\%$  . No hysteresis  was observed for both E1 and E1G20 cells according to the  $J{-}V$  scan curves shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information).  \n\nAs the stability of a tin-based PSC is a major challenge, we  tested the stability of our best cell E1G20 under severe environmental conditions.

The  superior enduring stability of the unencapsulated E1G20 device in air indicates that  the presence of guan id in i um as a cocation  with zero electric-dipolar moment inside the   ${\\mathrm{FA}}{\\mathrm{snI}}_{3}$   framework had the effect of retarding  the oxidation of perovskite in the presence  of moisture. The fabrication of air-stable Sn  \n\nbased perovskite solar cells has been clearly a challenging task,  but we have tackled this problem on incorporating a nonpolar  organic cation with an effective additive in a trace proportion.
