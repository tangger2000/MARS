CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

A spiro-OMeTAD HTL was deposited on  top of the perovskite layers by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for   $30~\\mathrm{s}$   from the  aforementioned solution. Finally, a   $100\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   gold electrode was thermally  deposited in vacuum to complete the devices. The completed devices  were encapsulated using a glass lid and UV-cured sealant. All the film  fabrication and device encapsulation were carried out in nitrogen, except  the spin-coating and annealing of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   in air with a relative humidity of   $\\approx\\!60\\%$  . In the devices, the thicknesses were  $30~\\mathsf{n m}$   for   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  ,   $650~\\mathsf{n m}$   for  the perovskite,   $150~\\mathsf{n m}$   for spiro-OMeTAD, and   $100\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   for Au.  \n\nOptimized PSC Fabrication Conditions : Deposition of   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   layer was  conducted in air with a relative humidity below  $30\\%$  . This humidity was  lower than that used for the initial batch and provided higher performing  PSCs. During a deposition of perovskite layer in a nitrogen-filled  glovebox, the glovebox was purged by nitrogen continuously to avoid the  solvent vapor-induced damage to a perovskite film.  \n\nCharacterization :  $J^{-V}$  measurements were performed on PSCs using a  computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source unit under simulated AM1.5G  solar illumination from a Xe lamp-based solar simulator (SRO-25 GD,  Bunkokeiki). The scan rate was   $0.2\\ \\vee\\ s^{-1}$   unless otherwise mentioned.  The active area of the PSCs was defined to be   $3.24~\\mathsf{m m}^{2}$     $(\\mathsf{I}.8\\times\\mathsf{I}.8\\ m m^{2})$    by using a black shadow mask while the original device area defined  by an overlap of the ITO and Au electrodes was   $4\\ m m^{2}$  . Prior to each  measurement, the lamp power was carefully calibrated at   $100\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$  (1 sun) using a crystalline Si reference cell with an amorphous Si optical  filter (Bunkokeiki), which was certificated by the National Institute of  Advanced Industrial Science and Technology of Japan. For morphological  and structural characterization of fresh and degraded perovskite films,  scotch tape was used to peel off the top metal electrode after carefully  removing the encapsulation glass. Then, chl oro benzene was used to  remove the HTL. Steady-state PL spectra of these perovskite films were  obtained using a JASCO FP-8600 spec tro flu oro meter with a wavelength  range between 600 and   $900\\ \\mathsf{n m}$   with a step of   $0.2\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  . The excitation  wavelength was fixed at  $460\\:\\mathsf{n m}$  . XRD patterns of the perovskite films were  evaluated with an XRD system using a typical 2  θ / θ  technique  $[\\lambda=].54\\:\\AA$    (CuK α )] (Rigaku, Ultima IV). SEM images and HR-SEM images of the  perovskite films were taken with a JEOL JCM-5700 and a HITACHI SU8000  system at an acceleration voltage of 5 and   $1~\\mathrm{\\bf~kV}$  with magnifications  of  $\\mathsf{c}_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}{\\times}\\mathsf{\\pi}_{0}\\mathsf{\\pi}_{000}$   and  $\\times\\ 40\\ 000$  , respectively. Quantitative elemental analysis  was performed on the samples with a HITACHI SU8000 SEM-EDS system  equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer.  \n\nDevice Lifetime Measurements : White light from a LED with an  intensity of   $\\bar{1}00\\ m\\mathbb{W}\\circ m^{-2}$   was used to illuminate the PSCs continuously  at  $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  .   $V_{0C},J_{S C},$  \n\nusing a lifetime measurement system (System Engineers). In between  scans, PSCs were connected with a  $\\rceil\\ \\lvert\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$   resistor.  \n\nPhotolysis Experiments of   $P b I_{2}$   Neat Film :   $0.5~\\mathrm{~M~}$   of   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   solution in  DMF: DMSO (4:1 vol/vol) was stirred at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for  $5\\,\\mathsf{h}$  . With this solution,   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   films were spin-coated on the cleaned glass substrates at 4000 rpm  for   $30~s$   and annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The film thicknesses were   $\\approx\\!60\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu m}$  , which was measured by a Dektak pro filo meter.   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   films were  irradiated by UV light for 1, 2, or   $3\\ \\mathsf{h}$  . It was noted that the samples were  put on a hot plate kept at 370 or   $500~\\mathsf{K}$   during the irradiation of UV light.  After irradiation, absorption spectra and XRD patterns of UV-illuminated  and fresh   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$   films were measured and compared.  \n\nImpact of Excess   $P b I_{2}$   on Performance of   $M A P b I_{3}$   Based PSCs :   $\\mathsf{M A P bI}_{3}$  films were prepared from a stoic hio metric solution of   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  : MAI  (1:1 by mol) with a concentration of   $1.2~\\mathrm{M}$   for each chemical. To prepare  precursor solutions with excess   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$  , 1.21 or   $1.23~\\mathrm{~M~}$   of   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   was used  while the concentration of MAI was fixed at   $1.2~\\mathrm{M}$  .   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   and MAI were  dissolved in a DMF: DMSO   $(4;1\\ \\mathsf{v o l}/\\mathsf{v o l})$   solvent. These solutions with  the different   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   concentrations were stirred at   $70~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   overnight. The  solutions were spin-coated on glass substrates coated with ITO and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   at   $4000\\ \\mathsf{r p m}$   for 30 s.   $200~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   of chl oro benzene was dropped on  the substrate at   $5\\ s$   after the spin program started. After the deposition  of the perovskite layers, the substrates were immediately annealed at   $100~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   for   $30~\\mathsf{m i n}$  . The fabrication conditions for other layers were the  same as those mentioned earlier.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThe authors thank Dr. Watanabe Dori for her instruction and assistance  for HR-SEM and SEM-EDS measurements.
