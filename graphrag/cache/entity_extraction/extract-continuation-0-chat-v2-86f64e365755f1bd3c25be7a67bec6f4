CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

The reduced trap density is ascribed  to the pass iv ation effect of DFPDA and the improved crystal  quality of the perovskite, which is consistent with the PL and  TRPL results (Figure 5b,c).  \n\nIt is found that the DFPDA is insoluble in chl oro benzene  (Figure S5, Supporting Information) and well-maintained even  after washing with chl oro benzene, as evidenced by the detectable F element in the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy for  the washed perovskite film (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting  Information), indicating a strong bond formed between the  perovskite and DFPDA. It is worth noting that the atomic ratio  of F/Pb is  ${\\approx}5.6{:}100$   (1:17 .9) in the final film, which is much higher  than in the precursor (0.4:100). Therefore, it is believed that the  DFPDA additive would be spontaneously excluded and distributed at the GBs and surface of the perovskite. The existence of  fluorine ions results in the surface becoming hydrophobic, as  evidenced by the increased contact angle (Figure 4c), which prevents the permeation of moisture and benefits the stability of the  perovskite. The influence of the top DFPDA layer on the SpiroOMeTAD was characterized by hole mobility measurement  using a space-charge-limited-current model (SCLC) (Figure S8,  Supporting Information). The photo current density-voltage   $(J-V)$   curves obtained in the dark for the Spiro-OMeTAD and  Spiro-OMeTAD/DFPDA bilayer films were fitted by the equation   $\\mu=8J_{\\mathrm{D}}L^{3}/9\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_{0}V^{2}$  ,  where   $\\mu_{;}$  ,   $J_{\\mathrm{D}}$  , and   $V$   are the charge  carrier mobility, current density, and applied voltage, respectively.  $\\mu$   is calculated to be   $1.53\\times10^{-4}$   and  $1.93\\times10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{S}^{-1}$  for the Spiro-OMeTAD and Spiro-OMeTAD/DFPDA films,  respectively, which means that the mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD  is increased  ${\\approx}12.6$   times by combination with DFPDA film. The  improved hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD can be assigned to  the influence of fluorine ions in the DFPDA molecule: fluorine ions can form different non covalent interactions, such as   $\\mathrm{F}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot\\mathrm{H}$   and   $\\operatorname{F}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot\\pi,$  , with Spiro-OMeTAD to increase its order,  resulting in increased hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD.  \n\nConsidering the above advantages of DFPDA additive on  the perovskite film and Spiro-OMeTAD layer, hybrid PSCs  with a typical structure are fabricated using Spiro-OMeTAD  and DFPDA as the HTL and additive, respectively ( Figure   6 a).  Figure S9, Supporting Information, depicts the cross-sectional  SEM images of the hybrid PSCs. The thickness of the perovskite film is almost unchanged by the addition of DFPDA. The  control perovskite film shows two grains laminated in the vertical direction. By contrast, dense and large crystal domains can  be observed along the vertical direction of the pervoskite film  with DFPDA additive, which effectively decreases the density  of GBs and benefits charge transport along the vertical direction.  Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted to study the effect of DFPDA additive on the energy  band character of the perovskite films in the hybrid PSCs. As  shown in Figure S10, Supporting Information, compared with  the control perovskite, the conduction band minimum, work  function, and valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite with DFPDA additive shift from  $-3.96$   to   $-3.82~\\mathrm{eV},$   from  − 4.12 to  $-3.92~\\mathrm{eV},$   and from  $-5.52$   to  $-5.38~\\mathrm{eV},$   respectively. The  upward-shifted work function positions (more n-type nature)  are probably due to the electron donor and/or pass iv ation  effect of the carbonyl groups   $(C=\\mathrm{O})$   in the DFPDA additive.   On the one hand, the lone pair electron on a carbonyl group  can transfer from the DFPDA to   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   in the perovskite, thus  increasing the Fermi level of the perovskite. On the other hand,  carbonyl groups passivate the charged species on the surface  that could provide extra energy levels within the forbidden gap  of the perovskite.  As shown in Figure 6b, the upward shifts  of the Fermi level and VBM position ensure better energy level  matching, which is favorable for photo generated hole extraction  from the perovskite to the Spiro-OMeTAD due to the increased  built-in potential and separating force.  \n\nFigure 6c depicts the  $J{-}V$  curves of regular planar PSCs with  different concentrations of DFPDA additive, and  Table   1  summarizes the detailed photovoltaic parameters. The control device  delivers a champion PCE of   $20.0\\%$   with an open circuit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\right)$   of   $1.08\\;\\mathrm{V},$   a short-circuit current   $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{sc}}\\right)$   of   $24.69\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , and  a fill factor (FF) of  $75.01\\%$  . When the DFPDA was added into the  perovskite, the PCEs of the corresponding PSCs first increased  and then decreased with the best device efficiency obtained  at a concentration of   $0.4\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\%$   DFPDA. A   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of   $1.10\\ \\mathrm{V},$  ,   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   of   $25.16\\mathrm{\\mA\\,cm}^{-2}$   $80.35\\%$   are obtained in the champion  device, yielding a PCE of   $22.21\\%$  . The enhanced performance  could be attributed to the improved perovskite film quality and  good pass iv ation effect of the DFPDA. Shown in Figure S11  and Table S6, Supporting Information, the hysteresis index   $\\mathrm{(HI=(PCE_{\\mathrm{reverse}}-P C E_{\\mathrm{forward}})/P C E_{\\mathrm{reverse}})}$   of the champion devices  with and without DFPDA additive were calculated according to  previous report.  The calculated HI is   $12.1\\%$   for the control  device, while this value decreased to   $2.95\\%$   for the device with  DFPDA. Therefore, with the introduction of DFPDA, there is  an obvious reduction in the hysteresis, which should benefit  from the efficient charge extraction at the perovskite (DFPDA)/ Spiro-OMeTAD interface and the reduced defect density in  perovskite as discussed previously. When more DFPDA (over   $0.4~\\mathrm{mol}\\%$  ) was added, the degradation of crystal lin it y caused  the PCE to decline, showing an apparent decrease in both   $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  and   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of  the champion devices with and without DFPDA additive are  depicted in Figure 6d. The integrated  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$   values of the devices  with and without DFPDA additive are 24.99 and  $24.47\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  respectively, which match well the values obtained from the   $J{-}V$   curves in Figure  6c   $\\scriptscriptstyle(<\\!1\\%$   discrepancy). Figure  6e shows  the steady-state current density and PCE measured at the  maximum power point of\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DFPDA<|>Additive<|>Fluorinated molecule used to improve perovskite film quality and passivate defects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Perovskite<|>Material<|>Semiconductor material used in the photovoltaic device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Spiro-OMeTAD<|>Material<|>Material used as the hole transport layer in the photovoltaic device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Hybrid PSCs<|>Device<|>Photovoltaic device with a perovskite absorber layer and Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Chloro benzene<|>Solvent<|>Solvent used to test the solubility of DFPDA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy<|>Characterization technique<|>Technique used to analyze the elemental composition of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Contact angle<|>Property<|>Measure of the wettability of the perovskite film surface)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Space-charge-limited-current model<|>Model<|>Model used to measure the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD films)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Photo current density-voltage<|>Property<|>Measure of the current and voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy<|>Characterization technique<|>Technique used to analyze the energy band structure of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Fermi level<|>Property<|>Energy level of the electrons in a material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Valence band maximum<|>Property<|>Highest energy level of the valence band in a material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Open circuit voltage<|>Property<|>Voltage of the photovoltaic device when no current is flowing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Short-circuit current<||>Property<|>Current of the photovoltaic device when the voltage is zero)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Fill factor<|>Property<|>Ratio of the maximum power output to the product of the open circuit voltage and short-circuit current)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Hysteresis index<|>Property<|>Measure of the hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>External quantum efficiency<|>Property<|>Measure of the efficiency of the photovoltaic device in converting photons to electrons)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DFPDA<|>Perovskite<|>DFPDA improves the crystal quality of the perovskite<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DFPDA<|>Spiro-OMeTAD<|>DFPDA increases the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DFPDA<|>Hybrid PSCs<|>DFPDA is used as an additive in the fabrication of hybrid PSCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Perovskite<|>Spiro-OMeTAD<|>Perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD are used together in the fabrication of hybrid PSCs<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Chloro benzene<|>DFPDA<|>DFPDA is insoluble in chloro benzene<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy<|>F element<|>Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is used to detect the presence of fluorine in the perovskite film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Contact angle<|>Hydrophobicity<|>The contact angle is increased by the presence of fluorine ions, indicating increased hydrophobicity<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Space-charge-limited-current model<|>Hole mobility<|>The space-charge-limited-current model is used to measure the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD films<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Photo current density-voltage<|>J-V curves<|>The photo current density-voltage curves are used to measure the current and voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic device<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy<|>Energy band structure<|>Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy is used to analyze the energy band structure of the perovskite film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Fermi level<|>Work function<|>The Fermi level and work function of the perovskite are shifted by the presence of DFPDA<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Valence band maximum<|>Fermi level<|>The valence band maximum and Fermi level of the perovskite are shifted by the presence of DFPDA<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Open circuit voltage<|>Short-circuit current<|>The open circuit voltage and short-circuit current are measured to determine the fill factor of the photovoltaic device<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Hysteresis index<|>DFPDA<|>The hysteresis index is reduced by the presence of DFPDA<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>External quantum efficiency<|>J-V curves<|>The external quantum efficiency is measured using the J-V curves of the photovoltaic device<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
