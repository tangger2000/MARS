CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

To understand the excellent rate capability of the   $S/\\mathrm{CNT}/$  PrNP cathode, CV was conducted at a scan rate of   $0.05\\ \\mathrm{mV}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  .  Two cathodic peaks were observed at   $2.2–2.4$   and   $2.0{-}2.1\\;\\mathrm{~V~}$    (Figure S7, Supporting Information), representing the stepwise  reduction of S to LiPSs and further to   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$  , respectively.   The slightly shifted peak in the high voltage toward left in the  PrNP cell was attributed to a lower content of CNT in   $S/\\mathrm{CNT}/$  PrNP composite compared with the routine   $S/\\mathrm{CNT}$   electrode.  Owing to the anchoring LiPS and promoting the LiPS conversion in the subsequent reductions, the PrNP cell demonstrated  sharper cathodic peaks than a routine cell. Interestingly, the  anodic process in a PrNP cell displayed two unambiguous  peaks while the routine cell represented a broad peak that  almost merged two anodic peaks, indicating the sluggish oxidation kinetics of insulating   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   compounds in PrNP-free cells.  \n\nTo reveal the role of the   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   promoter on the actual Li–S  batteries, the electrochemical performance was collected on  cells with the   $S/C N T/P r N P$   composite cathode. The   $S/C N T/$   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   electrode with   $70\\%$   S and   $10\\%$   PrNP delivered a discharge capacity of   $986~\\mathrm{mA}$   h   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   at   $0.2{\\mathrm{~C~}}$  . Further increasing  current density to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and   $4.0\\,\\mathrm{~C~}$   maintained reversible capacities of 853, 796, 753, and   $351~\\mathrm{mA}$   h  $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$  , respectively  ( Figure   4 a). When abruptly switching current density from  4 to   $0.2{\\mathrm{~C~}}$  again, the discharge capacity of   $854\\mathrm{\\mA\\hag}\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$   was  resumed. However, the   $\\mathrm{CNT}/S$   cathode with   $70\\%$   S exhibited a  \n\nThe inter facial affinity to LiPSs is the key to retard LiPS  \n\nshuttle and thus give rise to a stable Li–S cell in long life cycles.  The   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   with dual bonding to LiPSs is  anticipated to play a vital role to boost the  cycling performance of Li–S batteries. The  discharge capacity of the cell with   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   displayed an initial capacity of   $793\\mathrm{\\mA}$  h   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   at   $0.5\\,\\mathrm{~C~}$  . The   $\\mathrm{PrNIP}$   cell preserved high reversible capacity of   $695~\\mathrm{mA\\,h}~\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$   after 200 cycles,  and   $632\\mathrm{\\mA}$    h   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   after 400 cycles. In contrast, the routine cell exhibited a higher  initial discharge capacity of   $835\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}$  h   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$    but only retained a discharge capacity of  437 mA h  $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   after 200 cycles. This indicated  a significant capacity decay rate of   $0.23\\%$    per cycle in 200 cycles, approximately fourfold faster than the PrNP cell   $(0.062\\%)$  . To  confirm the importance of the multifaced  inter facial affinity to LiPSs, an   $\\mathrm{S/CNT/BaO}$    cathode was employed as a control sample  (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The S  electrode with PrNPs maintained a discharge  capacity of   $737\\,\\mathrm{\\mA}$    h   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$  , which is much  higher than that of BaO   $(625\\mathrm{~mA~h~g^{-1}})$  .  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/acdc402496676294daf238b123f5149d094b75f59018f312347317dde888cba4-1723832806.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   Electrochemical properties of Li–S cells with an   $\\mathsf{S/C N T/P r N P}$  cathode. a) The rate  capability of Li–S cell, b) galva no static discharge–charge profiles at a current density of   $2.0\\,\\mathsf C$  ,  c) long-term cycling performance at a current density of   $0.5\\subset$  , and d) stable operation of Li–S  cells with a range of sulfur loadings from 2.5 to   $5.2\\;\\mathsf{m g}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   at   $0.2\\,\\mathsf{C}$  .  \n\nThe conversion of S to   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   involves distinct two plateaus, implying solid–liquid– solid phase transfer. The occurrence of soluble LiPS in the first plateau is closely related  to the LiPS shuttle, while the formation of  solid   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   in the second plateau brings up the  cell resistance. The gradual capacity loss in  an Li–S cell intimately correlates to the evolution of these two  plateaus, which emphasize the analysis of high plateau capacity   $(Q_{\\mathrm{H}})$   and low plateau capacity  $(Q_{\\mathrm{{L}}})$  .  The   $S/C N T/\\mathrm{Pr}\\mathrm{NP}$   cathode  exhibited a mild   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}\\log{}$   in the long cycle tests, attaining  $84.8\\%$  and   $77.1\\%$   of the initial   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}$   in 200 and 400 cycles, respectively (Figure   $\\mathrm{S9a}$  , Supporting Information). However, the  routine   $\\mathrm{S/C}$   cathode displayed a marked   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}$   drop in the first  50 cycles and only maintained  $52.8\\%$   after 200 cycles. The similar capacity tendency can be identified in   $Q_{\\mathrm{{L}}}$   of two types of  cathodes (Figure S9b, Supporting Information). In general, the   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}$   determines the   $Q_{\\mathrm{{L}}}$   to some extent since the weak LiPS  bonding energy on the conductive scaffold inevitably causes the  rapid   $Q_{\\mathrm{H}}$   loss upon cycling, which subsequently worsens electrolyte, impedes   $\\mathrm{Li^{+}}$   diffusion, and builds up barriers for   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$  precipitation.  The   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   addition in the S cathode is capable  of regulating the LiPS diffusion,   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   nucleation, and propagation, and eventually influences the overall capacity of a cell.  \n\nTo understand the kinetic characteristics of a   $\\mathrm{PrNP}$   cell,  electrochemical impedance spectra were performed in the  1st and 50th cycles (Figure S10a, Supporting Information).  The intercept in the high-frequency regions was a measure of  the bulk electrolyte resistance   $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$   in a cell and the semicircle  in the high–medium-frequency region represented charge  transfer resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}})$  , which reflected the electrode/electrolyte inter facial resistance. In the first cycle, the cell with the   $S/C/\\mathrm{Pr}\\mathrm{NP}$   cathode exhibited an almost equal   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$     $(20.2\\ \\Omega)$   to  the routine cell   $(22.4\\ \\Omega)$  , indicating the comparable inter facial  resistance at the initial state. After the extended 50 cycling, a  noticeable augment of   $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$     $(41.6~\\Omega)$   can be identified in a routine cell while the PrNP cell achieved a similar value   $(20.9\\ \\Omega)$\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Liquid LiPS<|>Intermediate product<|>Lithium polysulfide in liquid state, intermediate in the conversion
