CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Inset: SHG response of  R -LIPF,  S -LIP,  rac -LIP, and KDP at  room temperature.  \n\npolarization switching is the most direct evidence of presence  of ferro electricity. We then performed the PFM-based hysteresis  loop measurements to study the local polarization switching  behavior on the thin film of  R -LIPF. From Figure 5e,f, the clear   $180^{\\circ}$   reversal of PFM phase signal and the typical butterfly loop  of amplitude signal can be observed, demonstrating the switchable polarization of ferroelectric domains. As deduced from  the minima of the amplitude loop, the local coercive voltage  for a selected point is relatively large, about   $112\\ \\mathrm{V}.$   To further  visualize the domain switching process, we carried out local  domain manipulation experiments on the thin film of  R -LIPF  (Figure S11, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S11a  in the Supporting Information, the as-grown state of thin film  exhibits the irregular domain structure with a clear phase contrast. When a tip under   $-200\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   bias was applied to pole the  thin-film surface for   $10~\\mathrm{s}$  , the central domain with purple color  expanded, indicating the polarization directions of some areas  were switched upwards (Figure S11b, Supporting Information).  All the above PFM results provide solid evidence for the stable  and switchable polarization in the thin film of  R -LIPF.  \n\nThe optical properties of the three compounds were  investigated by UV–vis absorption spectra in the solid state  ( Figure   6 a). They show similar absorption feature with a sharp  absorption edge at around   $550~\\mathrm{nm}$  , revealing a direct bandgap  semiconductor characteristic, typical for hybrid layered perovskites. The optical bandgap calculated from Tauc plot is   $2.34~\\mathrm{eV}$  for  R - and  S -LIPF and   $2.36~\\mathrm{eV}$   for  rac -LIP (Figure  6a, inset  and Figure S12, Supporting Information), comparable to that  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/7c0c1168030bea031b08dcd796a31ddcf499f787080c0d659ca1475d7b9c4b23-1727122929.jpg)  \nFigure 5.   a–d) Vertical and lateral PFM phase and amplitude images in the thin film of  R -LIPF. e,f) Vertical PFM phase and amplitude signals as functions of the tip voltage for a selected point at room temperature, showing local PFM hysteresis loops.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/caf95feb1d483eb5128f936639d41977f8e3b2717f6b6f6f239fe99c76e5de52-1727122897.jpg)  \nFigure 6.   a) UV–vis absorption spectrum of  R -LIPF,  S -LIPF, and  rac -LIP.

They also present  strong photo luminescence (PL) emission peaks at   $551\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   at  the vicinity of the onset of the absorption edge under different  selected excitation wavelength from 380 to   $500~\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 6b;  Figure S13, Supporting Information). This provides a good candidate for the development of 2D ferroelectric semiconductor  devices.  \n\nIn summary, we have successfully demonstrated 2D  homochiral lead iodide perovskite ferroelectric s [ R - and  S -1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethyl ammonium  $]_{2}\\mathrm{PbI}_{4},$  , which show outstanding ferroelectric performance with an extraordinary high  phase transition temperature of 483 and   $473.2\\mathrm{~K},$  , respectively,  as well as the multiaxial ferroelectric nature. They also display the unique homochirality and the semiconductor characteristic with a direct bandgap of   $2.34~\\mathrm{eV}.$   In contrast to the  racemic counterpart, the homochiral molecule makes the 2D  lead iodide per ovsk ites much favorable to crystalize in polar  point groups required for ferroelectric s. This work opens a  feasible avenue to design 2D lead iodide perovskite ferroelectrics. Considering that both the homochiral cation and the  thickness of the inorganic layer have much room to be regulated, more 2D lead iodide perovskite ferroelectric s with better  properties and greater application prospects can be constructed. Work on increasing the perovskite layer thickness by  introducing   $[\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{NH}_{3}]^{+}$  ,   $[\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{NH}_{2})_{2}]^{+}$  , and   $C s^{+}$   cations is currently underway.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : [ R -,  S -, and  rac -1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethyl ammonium  $\\mathsf{l}_{2}\\mathsf{P b I}_{4}$  were prepared with the same method by mixing stoic hio metric  amounts of   ${\\sf P b I}_{2}$   and the corresponding  R -,  S -, and  rac -1-(4- chl oro phenyl)ethylamine in HI solution in a round bottom flask. The  produced orange precipitates were dissolved by heating to get a clear  solution. Slowly cooling the solution resulted in the formation of platelike orange crystals of the target compounds. Thermo grav i metric  analyses (TGA) showed that [ R -,  S -, and  rac -1-(4-chl oro phenyl) ethyl ammonium  $\\mathsf{]}_{2}\\mathsf{P b I}_{4}$   were thermally stable up to about 512, 512,  and   $527\\ \\mathsf{K},$   respectively, before decomposition (Figure S14, Supporting  Information).  \n\nThin-Film  Preparation :  The  precursor  solutions  of  [ R -1-(4- chl oro phenyl)ethyl ammonium  $\\mathsf{I}]_{2}\\mathsf{P b I}_{4}$    were  prepared  by  dissolving   $40\\:\\mathrm{\\textmu g}$   of the as-grown crystals in   $1\\;\\mathrm{\\textmu l u}\\;N,N$  -dimethyl me than amide.  Cleaned ITO (indium tin oxide)-coated glass was put onto the hotplate  with   $120~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for 5 min. Then, a drop   $(\\mathsf{I}\\,0\\;\\upmu\\mathsf{L})$   of precursor solution was  carefully spread on the hot substrate to obtain compact thin films of  [ R -1-(4-chl oro phenyl)ethyl ammonium  $\\mathsf{l}_{2}\\mathsf{P b I}_{4}$  . The phase purity of the thin  film was confirmed by the PXRD (Figure S15, Supporting Information).  \n\nCCDC 1885084-1885086 contains the crystallographic data in the  Supporting Information for this paper.
