CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF.

Lower Gibbs free energies in heterogeneous nucleation are known to facilitate the perovskite  nucleation process.  Thus, the carboxylic acid- and hydroxylrich RCQs on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   surface can promote perovskite  crystal lin it y and, thus, an increased grain size, as observed by  SEM and AFM, and later by GIXRD. The optical absorption  spectrum (Figure  2b) and the photo luminescence (PL) spectrum (Figure 2c) of the perovskite film grown on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs  further demonstrate higher light absorption and weaker PL  emission than those of the control film, indicating enhanced  photo generated carrier generation with reduced recombination, which will eventually lead to increased photo currents  in the PSCs.  The enhanced extraction of electrons in the  perovskite film grown on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   was further confirmed  by time-resolved photo luminescence (TRPL) measurements  (Figure 2d), which showed that the lifetime of an electron in  this film was significantly reduced to 44 from 103  ns in the  control film grown on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  .  \n\nSynchrotron-based 2D-GIXRD measurements were performed to further show the change in film crystallization on the \n\n  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs film.  In Figure 2e, both the perovskite films on \n\n  $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}{\\cdot}\\mathrm{{RCS}}}$   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   exhibit diffraction profiles that are similar to those reported for textured highly crystallized perovskite  films. To quantify the crystal lin it y difference between these  films, we show in Figure 2f the  $q$  -dependent 1D-GIXRD spectra  around the perovskite (110) peak in Figure 2e. Both (110) diffraction peaks at   $q\\approx10.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$   exhibit similarly symmetrical  intensity profiles, proving the formation of a highly crystallized  film with high-phase purity in both cases. However, in addition  to the lower (110) diffraction peak corresponding to a low crystall iz ation degree, a mesophase feature at   $q\\approx9.3~\\mathrm{{nm}^{-1}}$   appears  in the perovskite film deposited on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , indicating an incomplete crystal structural transition from precursor to perovskite.  Therefore, the GIXRD results show that the perovskite film  grown on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs had a higher crystallization degree than  that grown on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   ETLs, which can help to enhance the  device performance of PSCs in the future.  \n\nMicro structural uniformity is crucial in large high-performance  PSCs. To investigate the variation in the crystal lin it y at different  locations in the perovskite films deposited on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}.$  - RCQs, we show in  Figure    3 a a schematic of the GIXRD line  scan, i.e., the change in the 2D GIXRD pattern is recorded by  scanning along the   $\\gamma\\cdot$  -direction perpendicular to the incoming  X-ray beam on the sample surface. At different   $\\gamma$  -locations, the  detected pattern actually averages over an irradiated area to  form a line shape that is elongated in the   $_{x}$  -direction because  of the small grazing X-ray incidence angle. Figure 3b,c shows  the 1D GIXRD profiles around the perovskite (110) peak  that were obtained from the 2D GIXRD patterns at different   $\\gamma$  -locations of the films on  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs, respectively, to  provide an overview of the uniformity of the crystal lin it y of the  two films. In the perovskite film on   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -RCQs in Figure 3b,  all diffraction profiles are almost identical and have a slightly  asymmetric (110) peak, which indicates the formation of a relatively pure perovskite phase structure over the entire scanning  area. By contrast, for the control film on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  , all (110) diffraction peaks are broader than those on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs, and three of  these peaks are fairly asymmetric and exhibit different shapes,  indicating a film with a lower crystallization degree and a less  pure phase that contains more residual stress, impurities, and  defects. For a better comparison, Figure 3d,e summarizes the  full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the position of the  (110) perovskite peak at different   $\\gamma$  -locations, respectively. Both  the FWHM and the peak position for the control film on   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$    clearly vary more significantly than those for the film on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}.$  - RCQs. Therefore, doping RCQs into   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   not only promotes  perovskite film crystallization, but also significantly improves  the film micro structural uniformity, which is desirable for large  high-performance PSCs.  \n\nAll of the present perovskite film structural enhancements could be attributed to the highly conjugated SH- and  OH-rich RCQs at the ETL/perovskite interface that are shown  in Figure 3f. These RCQs reduce the Gibbs free energy of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   surface to facilitate the perovskite nucleation process and  serve as nucleation centers for perovskite growth.  In addition, the RCQs at the interface can bond efficiently with the  in completely coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   of the per ovsk ites to promote  high-quality film formation.  Like phenyl-C61-butyric acid  methyl ester, the highly conjugated units in RCQs can also  form RCQ-iodide radicals to lower the content of Pb-I defects  at the ETL/perovskite interface.  However, the uncoordinated  lead ions on the grain boundaries (dangling bonds) can interact  with the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups on the RCQs  surface to reduce I-ion migration and non radiative recombination (discussed below), which may contribute to the reduction  of the negligible hysteresis of PSCs.  \n\nTo determine how the novel  $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs ETL can promote PSC  performance, we fabricated a series of   $\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{s}_{0.05}(\\mathrm{MA}_{0.17}\\mathrm{FA}_{0.83})_{0.95}$   $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{I}_{0.83}\\mathrm{Br}_{0.17})_{3}$  -based planar-type PSCs on both the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and  the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs ETLs with an   $\\mathrm{ITO/S n O}_{2}$     $(20\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$  )/perovskite   $(540~\\mathrm{nm})$  )/spiro-OMeTAD   $(80\\ \\mathrm{nm})/\\mathrm{MoO}_{3}$     $(5\\mathrm{~nm})/\\mathrm{Au}$     $(100\\ \\mathrm{nm})$  structure, as shown in  Figure   4 a. Figure 4b shows the current  density versus the voltage   $(J-V)$   for the champion PSCs based  on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -RCQs ETLs under an illumination of  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/8a2439b1757d0db959a2065e86baa7d2fea41c66f43004d9969496fe5b5cff75-1723835116.jpg)  \nFigure 3.  $\\gamma.$  profiles around the perovskite (110) peak derived from the GIXRD patterns at different  y  locations, respectively. d,e) FWHM and position of the  perovskite (110) peak at different  y  locations, respectively. f) Crystalline mechanism of a perovskite film grown on   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   ETL\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RCQs<|>Reagent<|>Reagents with carboxylic acid- and hydroxyl-rich surfaces used in the synthesis process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SnO2<|>Equipment<|>Equipment used in the synthesis process, specifically the substrate for the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Perovskite film<|>Product<|>Final product of the synthesis process, a film with enhanced crystallinity and optical properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Gibbs free energy<|>Reaction condition<|>A thermodynamic property that influences the nucleation process of perovskite crystals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEM<|>Characterization technique<|>Scanning Electron Microscopy, a technique used to observe the morphology of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFM<|>Characterization technique<|>Atomic Force Microscopy, a technique used to observe the morphology of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIXRD<|>Characterization technique<|>Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction, a technique used to analyze the crystallinity of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Optical absorption spectrum<|>Characterization technique<|>A technique used to measure the light absorption properties of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum<|>Characterization technique<|>A technique used to measure the light emission properties of the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL)<|>Characterization technique<|>A technique used to measure the lifetime of photo-generated carriers in the perovskite film)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITO<|>Equipment<|>Indium Tin Oxide, a transparent conductive oxide used in the fabrication of PSCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Spiro-OMeTAD<|>Equipment<|>Spiro-MeTAD, a hole transport material used in the fabrication of PSCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MoO3<|>Equipment<|>Molybdenum trioxide, a buffer layer used in the fabrication of PSCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Au<|>Equipment<|>Gold, a metal used as the top electrode in the fabrication of PSCs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSCs<|>Product<|>Perovskite Solar Cells, the final product of the synthesis process)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RCQs<|>Perovskite film<|>RCQs are used to promote the crystallinity of the perovskite film<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SnO2<|>Perovskite film<|>SnO2 is the substrate on which the perovskite film is grown<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Gibbs free energy<|>Perovskite film<|>Lower Gibbs free energy facilitates the nucleation process of perovskite crystals<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEM<|>Perovskite film<|>SEM is used to observe the morphology of the perovskite film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFM<|>Perovskite film<|>AFM is used to observe the morphology of the perovskite film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIXRD<|>Perovskite film<|>GIXRD is used to analyze the crystallinity of the perovskite film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Optical absorption spectrum<|>Perovskite film<|>Optical absorption spectrum is used to measure the light absorption properties of the perovskite film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum<|>Perovskite film<|>Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum is used to measure the light emission properties of the perovskite film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL)<|>Perovskite film<|>Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is used to measure the lifetime of photo-generated carriers in the perovskite film<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITO<|>PSCs<|>ITO is used as the transparent conductive oxide in the fabrication of PSCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Spiro-OMeTAD<|>PSCs<|>Spiro-OMeTAD is used as the hole transport material in the fabrication of PSCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MoO3<|>PSCs<|>MoO3 is used as the buffer layer in the fabrication of PSCs<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Au<|>PSCs<|>Au is used as the top electrode in the fabrication of PSCs<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
