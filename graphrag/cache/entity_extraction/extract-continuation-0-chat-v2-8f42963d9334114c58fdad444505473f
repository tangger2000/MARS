CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Polarization resistance   $(R_{\\mathrm{p}})$   from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  is crucial to the electrode performance. As expected,   $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$   values  are significantly reduced by the in situ exsolution operation  (Figure S10b, Supporting Information). For example,   $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$   is  reduced by   $57.9\\%$  , from   $0.280~\\Omega~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   of the SFMC-GDC cell  to   $0.118\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   of the SFMC-GDC 2h cell (Figure  4b). Each  EIS data can be fitted with the equivalent circuit, that is, L1-R0- (R1-CPE1)-(R2-CPE2) (inset in Figure 4b). As proposed by the  previous studies,  the high-frequency process is assigned to  charge transfer and ion migration processes, and the low-frequency process is related to the electrochemical adsorption and  activation processes. The   $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$   values of the two cells at various  temperatures and the sub-process resistances are presented in  Figure 4c, Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information. All the  resistances are reduced significantly, and the activation energy \n\n  $\\left(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\right)$   of the electrode reaction (R2) is decreased slightly from \n\n 110.6 to   $102.3\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}}$   (Figure 4d), illustrating the improved  catalytic activity by in situ exsolved CoFe alloy nanoparticles.  \n\nPotenti o static  tests  of  these  cells  were  conducted  (Figure S10c, Supporting Information) to measure the CO  volumetric production and corresponding Faradaic efficiencies  (Figure S10d, Supporting Information), which further confirms the enhanced performance of CoFe alloy nanoparticlesdecorated cathodes. To assess the stability and coking resistance  of SFMC-GDC and SFMC-GDC 2h cells, the current densities  at a constant voltage of   $1.2\\mathrm{~V~}$   were recorded as a function of  time, as shown in Figure 4e. The current density of the SFMCGDC 2h cell stabilizes at   ${\\approx}0.40\\;\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  and no distinct degradation is observed over   $230\\textrm{h}$  . Compared to the SFMC-GDC cell  (the decrease rate is   $8.6\\mathrm{\\mA\\h^{-1}}$  ), the stability is significantly  improved by the in situ exsolved CoFe alloy nanoparticles   $(0.17\\,\\mathrm{\\mA\\h^{-1}}$   for SFMC-GDC 2h cell), which is comparable  with the reported materials that process high stability and  Faradaic efficiencies,  and is much higher than our  previous result.  The corresponding Faradaic efficiencies fluctuate slightly above  $98.0\\%$  (Figure 4e), indicative of no coke formation, in accordance with Raman results after the stability test  (Figure S11, Supporting Information).  \n\nThe redox stability of the SFMC-GDC 2h cell was also  assessed (Figure  4f; Figures S12a and S12b, Supporting  Information). In practical applications, the SOECs are  expected with good redox cycling stability since the system  might suffer from inevitable fuel supply interruption  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/84ce76dcb155809ad2a1317e554c7de69fc6bb051c1d3dd410643e27c160a36f-1727127549.jpg)  \nFigure 3.   a–d) SEM images of SFMC (a), SFMC 1h (b), SFMC 2h (c), and SFMC 4h (d). e,f) Annular dark field (ADF) and bright field (BF) STEM images  of SFMC 2h. g) HRTEM image of SFMC 2h and h) STEM image and element maps of SFMC 2h.  \n\nduring a long-term operation. In addition, it can be a feasible strategy for solving the possible problems of particle  agglomeration and coke formation in the cathode through  redox cycles. All of the 12 redox cycles display good reproducibility,  demonstrating  excellent  redox  r ever sibi lit y.  This result is comparable with the reported materials,  such  as   $(\\mathrm{La}_{0.75}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.25})_{0.9}(\\mathrm{Cr}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.5})_{0.9}(\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Cu}_{0.5})_{0.1}\\mathrm{O}_{3-\\delta}{}^{[5]}$  and   $(\\mathrm{La}_{0.2}\\mathrm{Sr}_{0.8})_{0.95}\\mathrm{Ti}_{0.85}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.1}\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.05}\\mathrm{O}_{3+\\delta}.$   Therefore, SFMCGDC 2h cell shows a high catalytic activity, stability, coking  resistance, and redox r ever sibi lit y, which make it a potential cathode material for   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis. It should be noted  that the change in the surface morphology results in slightly  improved SOEC performance (Figure S12c, Supporting  Information) since the surface of SFMC becomes rough  after exsolution/re-oxidation cycles (Figure S1h, Supporting  Information).  \n\nDFT calculations were performed to understand the mechanism of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis.   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis over SFMC surface,  RP-SFMC surface, and CoFe  $@$  SFMC (the composition of SFMC  2h) interface are investigated, including the transfer of  $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$   inside  SFMC and RP-SFMC. As the RP-SFMC could not be synthesized  using the same method as SFMC, DFT calculation prediction is  used for comparison. The potential energy diagrams in  Figure   5 and the corresponding structures in Figure S13, Supporting  Information, display the whole pathways of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis over  three patterns: SFMC (121) surface, RP-SFMC (105) (Figures S14  and S15, Supporting Information) surface, and CoFe  $@$  SFMC  interface. At   $800~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   and   $0\\ \\mathrm{V},$     $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   molecule is trapped stoutly at  CoFe  $@$  SFMC interface compared to SFMC, which is consistent  with the experimental result of enhanced adsorption of   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   after  the exsolution (Figure S8, Supporting Information). By Bader  charge analysis, the active center transfers   $0.95~\\left|\\mathrm{e}\\right|$   amount of  electrons to   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   to form   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}{^{\\delta-}}$  for CoFe  $@$  SFMC, while 0.84  | e | for SFMC, indicative of the enhanced   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   adsorption of CoFe  $@$  SFMC. Then this activated   $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}{^{\\delta-}}$   in CoFe  $@$  SFMC would enable  the barrier of   $0.27\\,\\mathrm{\\eV}$   for CO generation, and the analogous  barrier is   $0.77~\\mathrm{eV}$   in the case of SFMC (Figure  5a). Therefore,  CoFe  $@$  SFMC cathode displays enhanced  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   electrolysis performance compared to SFMC and RP-SFMC cathodes (Figure S13a,  Supporting Information).
