CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

X-ray diffraction (XRD)  was conducted to explore the effect of different ETLs on the  perovskite crystallization. As shown in Figure  3d, the characteristic diffraction peaks of all the perovskite films are almost  the same, along with a similar peak intensity. Note that the diffraction peak at   $12.7^{\\circ}$   with a strong peak intensity should be  assigned to   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$  , and these moderate residues of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   could  passivate the surface or grain boundary defects of perovskite  films.  \n\nIn order to explore whether RbF penetrates into the perovskite, time-of-flight secondary ions mass spectroscopy (ToFSIMS) was used to study the depth profile of RbF in the  structure of the ETL/perovskite. For the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  /RbF/perovskite  film, Figure 3e shows that the curve of   $\\mathrm{Rb+}$   shows an almost  constant height in the perovskite region, demonstrating  a homogeneous distribution of the Rb in the perovskite  layer. The low adsorption energy of Rb on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   surface  observed in DFT could lead the Rb ions to easily escape into  the perovskite. The infiltrated Rb ions are likely to partially  occupy the interstitial sites of the perovskite, which will further inhibit ion migration and thereby suppress the mutual  reaction of halides.  As shown in Figure S11, Supporting  Information, the XPS spectra of  $\\mathrm{Rb}\\;3\\mathrm{d}$   for the perovskite films  based on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   display no obvious peak, which signifies  that only a very small amount of   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   cations have penetrated  into the perovskite. However, it's interesting that the curve of  F- decreases severely from the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   layer to the perovskite  layer for the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   sample, which signifies that the F  ions still stay at the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}/$  perovskite interface and do not  enter the perovskite layer. Why do the F ions have a stronger  favoritism for staying at the surface instead of infiltrating  into the perovskite lattice? On the one hand, the huge size  difference between I and F ions would induce a severe lattice strain once F ions were incorporated into the perovskite  lattice. On the other hand, F ions locating at the FAI-terminated surfaces would make the local structure more stable via  increasing the bonding with  $\\mathrm{Pb}$   and hydrogen bonds with FA  ions.  Figure 3f shows the depth profile of RbF in the   $\\mathrm{SnO_{2}}.$  - RbF/perovskite model. Unlike the distribution of   $\\mathrm{Rb+}$   in the   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}_{f}}}$  perovskite film, here we can see that the   $\\mathrm{Rb+}$   curve  gradually rises in the perovskite region, which demonstrates  that the Rb ions gradient penetrate into the perovskite layer  and mainly distribute at the bottom of the perovskite films. In  addition, the F ions still stay at the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2,}$  /perovskite interface  as discussed earlier.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/9c1ff8cb1d3700290d68ab4a896fcc012b8299397728bb59b54b7f46452dee33-1727101952.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   a) Dark   $I{-}V$   curves for the electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/various  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/$  perovskite/PCBM/Ag. b) Steady-state PL and c) TRPL  spectra of perovskite films deposited on different ETLs.  \n\nSubsequently, we fabricated electron-only devices with a  structure of   $\\mathrm{ITO/S n O}_{2}/$  perovskite/PCBM/Ag to investigate the  trap-state density of perovskite films based on different ETLs. The corresponding dark   $I{-}V$   curves are displayed in  Figure   4 a,  which are divided into three parts including the ohmic region  at low bias voltage, trap-filling limited region with current  increasing greatly, and then the trap-free child's region.  The  trap density   $\\left(N_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)$   is determined by the trap-filled limit voltage   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\right)$   as follows:  \n\n$$\nN_{t}=\\frac{2V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}\\mathbf{\\mathcal{E}}_{r}\\mathbf{\\mathcal{E}}_{0}}{q L^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $L$   is the thickness of the perovskite film,   $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$   is the relative  dielectric constant of the perovskite,   $\\varepsilon_{0}$   is the vacuum permittivity,   $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$   is the onset voltage of the trap filled limit region,  and   $q$   is the electron charge. The calculated   $N_{\\mathrm{t}}$   of perovskite  based on   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  ,   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -RbF and   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/\\mathrm{{RbF}}}$   are   $1.88~\\times~10^{15}$  ,   $1.44\\times10^{15}$  , and   $1.12\\,\\times\\,10^{15}\\,\\,\\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$  , respectively (Table  S4, Sup- porting Information). This result shows that surface modification can reduce defects more effectively than introducing RbF  into the bulk   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  . Both theoretical studies and experimental  evidences have suggested that interstitial halogen   $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{I}_{i}$   and   $\\mathrm{Br}_{i,}$  )  defects and vacancies of lead   $(V_{\\mathrm{Pb}})$   and halides (  $V_{\\mathrm{I}}$   or   $V_{\\mathrm{Br}})$   act as  the main portions of traps in mixed halide perovskite.  The  medium ion radius of   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   make it possible to occupy interstitials or the A-site in the perovskite lattice. For example, recently  Nogueira and co-workers reported that   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   binds to interstitial  halogen   $\\mathrm{I}_{i}$   and Br i ) defects at the grain boundaries, resulting  in a reduced deep traps density by the formation of shallower  states.  In addition, theoretical research also demonstrated  that the deep traps can be reduced by alkali metals in contact  with interstitial halide defects.  For these reasons, we conclude that the decreased trap density should be attributed to the   $\\mathrm{Rb^{+}}$   cations, including those locating at the interface and in the  bulk perovskite.  \n\nTo investigate the charge carrier dynamics in the perovskite  films based on the various ETLs, photo luminescence (PL)  spectra were performed with the excitation wavelength of   $485\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  . Figure   $^{4\\dag}$   shows that perovskite films based on RbFtreated   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   have a stronger steady-state PL intensity (the light  is incident from the perovskite side), which demonstrates that  the corresponding perovskite films are of high quality. In addition, PL peaks shift to a shorter wavelength after surface treatment, indicating that the perovskite films with RbF modification have fewer defects. Figure  $4c$   displays the time-resolved PL  (TRPL) spectra fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, and  the corresponding fitted data are listed in Table S5, Supporting  Information. As we all know, the fast decay   $(\\tau_{1})$   is ascribed to  the quenching of carriers at the ETL/perovskite interface, while  the slow decay   $(\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role":
