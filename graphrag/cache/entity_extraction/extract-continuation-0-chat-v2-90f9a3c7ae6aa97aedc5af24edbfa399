CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is worth noting that  this new perovskite type material features a chemical formula  of   $(\\mathrm{MPEA})_{1.5}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3.5}(\\mathrm{DMSO})_{0.5}$  , in which the solvent DMSO  mole­ cules coordinated axially with   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  in the partially edgeshared octahedron s ( Figure   2 A). The displacement of halide Br  with DMSO in the   $\\mathrm{[PbX_{6}]}$   octahedron s and the resulted structure distortion caused the long-range polar nature of the chiral  perov­ skite nanowires (Figure  2B–E). NLO measurements on  the single nanowires demonstrated an effective second-order  NLO coefficient   $(d_{\\mathrm{eff}})$   of   ${\\approx}0.68\\,\\mathrm{\\pm}\\,\\mathrm{\\V}^{-1}$  with that of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, KDP) ( Table   1 ),  with a polarization ratio as high as   $(96.4\\pm0.1)\\%$   when pumped  with linearly polarized fs laser pulse at   $850\\;\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure 2G). This  new halide perovskite exhibited a remarkable thermo-, air-, and  optical stability, with a laser damage threshold of   $\\approx\\!0.52\\;\\mathrm{m}$  J  $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   $(8.6\\times10^{4}\\;\\mathrm{W}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ) (Figure 2F). These nanowires also exhibited  an NLO circular dichroism when pumped with circularly polarized light, with an SHG-CD of   $(74.0\\pm0.1)\\%$   when the analyzer  is perpendicular to the nanowire axis (Figure 2H).  \n\nThe strategy of introducing chiral amines has also been  applied for constructing metal-free halide per ovsk ites with noncentro symmetric geometries along with ferro electricity and  SHG.
