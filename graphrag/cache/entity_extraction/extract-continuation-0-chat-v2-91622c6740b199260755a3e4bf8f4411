CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Serial numbers 1, 2, and 3 denote low, medium, and high  $\\sf{O}_{\\mathrm{v}}$    density, respectively.  \n\npermittivity (Figure S14a, Supporting Information) increased  with the spinel phase. Additionally, the presence of oxygen  vacancies intensified the electron enrichment phenomenon. In  Figure 5f, it can be observed that the polarization area around  the oxygen atom significantly increased.  \n\nIn contrast to the spinel/perovskite HE oxides, Figure S33a  (Supporting Information), Figure  5g, and Figure S33b (Supporting Information) depict the band structure of rock salt/ spinel HE oxides with increasing spinel content. The DOS  increased with the spinel phase. Moreover, the band structure  and DOS support the prior conclusion that the system exhibits  metal li city. The gain and loss of electrons between atoms at the  system interface are depicted in Figure 5i. It can be observed  that the electrons tend to move toward the spinel phase. When  the spinel content increases, the ability of oxygen atoms to  acquire electrons at the interface also increases. Figure S33d  \n\n (Supporting Information), Figure  5j and Figure S33e  \n\n (Supporting Information) depict the band structure at various  oxygen vacancy contents. The number of energy bands is considerably higher in Figure S33b (Supporting Information),  while the band gap is shorter. The increased polarization of  oxygen atoms in Figure  5l compared to Figure  5i–1 can be  attributed to electron enrichment due to oxygen vacancies.  \n\n# 3. Conclusion  \n\nIn this study, to improve the intrinsically weak microwave  absorption of HE oxides, dual-phase HE ceramic absorbers  were designed; subsequently, their phase content and structural  defects were quantitatively characterized and controlled. Point  defects and stacking faults were observed near the spinel (111)/ perovskite (111) and rock salt (220)/spinel (220) interfaces, and  numerous defects were found inside the complex-phase due  to stress concentration and lattice distortion. Further quantitative characterization of the defects demonstrated their effect on  the EM parameters of HE oxide, i.e., the presence of defects  favors dielectric enhancement. First-principles calculations  confirmed that the modulation of phases and defects can effectively improve the polarization properties of dual-phase HE  oxides. Owning to the numerous heterogeneous interfaces,  multiple defect sites for lossy EM waves, and efficient control  of the electromagnetic parameters by the tunable defects, the  two biphasic HE oxides used in this study demonstrated outstanding broadband microwave absorption in the X-band.  Thus, the EM wave absorption performance of HE oxides was  successfully improved. These results can be used as guidelines  for designing efficient microwave absorbers of HE oxides and  the regulating their components and defects.  \n\n# 4.

Subsequently, the slurries  were dried at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$   in an oven until the alcohol evaporated.
