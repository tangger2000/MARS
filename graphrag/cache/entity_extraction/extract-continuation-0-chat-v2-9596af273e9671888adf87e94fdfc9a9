CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

However, the synthesis of Cd-based QDs  involves a highly complex core–shell  growth process, high synthesis temperature   $(\\approx\\!300\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  , and long reaction time.   These harsh conditions limit their commercial production. Similarly, the currently reported other   $\\mathrm{QDs}^{[11,12]}$   (e.g., InP)  are also faced with the complex core–shell  synthesis. In addition, they exhibited low  peak EQE   $(\\approx\\!3.46\\%)$   and poor color purity  due to large full width at half maximum  (FWHM). Therefore, the industrialization  of QLED displays is heavily limited by QD  materials.  \n\nDeveloping low-cost and high-quality quantum dots (QDs) or nano crystals  (NCs) and their corresponding efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is crucial  for the next-generation ultra-high-definition flexible displays. Here, there is  a report on a room-temperature triple-ligand surface engineering strategy  to play the synergistic role of short ligands of tetra oct yl ammonium bromide \n\n (TOAB), dido dec yl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB), and octanoic acid \n\n (OTAc) toward “ideal” perovskite QDs with a high photo luminescence  quantum yield (PLQY) of   $\\mathord{>}\\mathbf{90\\%}$  , unity radiative decay in its intrinsic channel,  stable ink characteristics, and effective charge injection and transportation  in QD films, resulting in the highly efficient QD-based LEDs (QLEDs).  Furthermore, the QD films with less non radiative recombination centers  exhibit improved PL properties with a PLQY of  $\\mathbf{\\Theta\\!\\!\\!\\!\\slash}\\mathbf{\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!$   through dopant  engineering in A-site. The robustness of such properties is demonstrated by  the fabrication of green electro luminescent LEDs based on  $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs with  the peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1  $11.6\\%,$  , and the corresponding  peak internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and power efficiency are   $\\pmb{52.2\\%}$   and   $44.65\\;|\\mathfrak{m}\\,\\mathbb{W}^{-1}$  , respectively, which are the most-efficient perovskite QLEDs  with colloidal   $\\mathsf{c s P b B r}_{3}$   QDs as emitters up to now. These results demonstrate  that the as-obtained QD inks have a wide range application in future highdefinition QD displays and high-quality lightings.  \n\nHalide per ovsk ites, which have enjoyed  significant success in the applications  of solar cells,  light-emitting diodes  (LEDs),   and  photodetector s,   show great potential as a new generation  of emitter materials. In addition to their  composition-dependent  op to electronic  properties, these materials in the QD form  have high photo luminescence quantum  yields (PLQYs) of up to   $95\\%$   and narrow  \n\nQuantum-dot-based light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) with narrow  and finely tunable emission spectra, which show high purity  and real color, have been considered a promising candidate  for next-generation flexible and high-definition displays.   Among semiconductor colloidal quantum dots (QDs), Cd-based  LEDs first developed in   $1994^{[6]}$   provide a maximum external  quantum efficiency (EQE) of   $19.8\\%$  ,   $15.45\\%$  , and   $20.5\\%$   for  \n\nlight-emitting peaks with an FWHM of about   $20~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  , making  them particularly attractive for high-quality lightings and displays.  Among recently reported perovskite QDs synthesized  by wet-chemistry colloidal methods, inorganic perovskite  cesium lead halides   $(\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$  ,  $\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Cl}$  , Br, and I) are favorable for  practical applications given high thermal stability and low moisture sensitivity  compared with organic–inorganic hybrid  counterparts.   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   QDs exhibiting tunable and highly efficient PL were first synthesized by Kovalenko and co-workers   in 2015. These multicolored LEDs were first reported from  Song et al.,  and the   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   green LEDs exhibited an EQE  of   $0.12\\%$   and a brightness of   $946~\\mathrm{{cd}}~\\mathrm{{m}}^{-2}$  . Presently, LEDs based  on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   QDs demonstrate EQEs of up to   $8.73\\%$   and a peak  luminance of up to   $\\scriptstyle>15\\ 000$   cd   $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$  .  QD materials used  in these devices are synthesized through the hot-injection (HI)  method under the inert gas, which conflicts with low-cost consumption.  Thus, a synthetic process, carried out at room  temperature (RT) without inert gas, was proposed to prepare   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{X}_{3}$   QDs. However, the PLQY of wetchemistry synthesized QDs at RT is relatively  low compared with that synthesized through  the HI process.  Meanwhile, the products accompanied by large particles are not  ideal for assembling high-quality films, thus  leading to poor device performance. The  peak EQE and luminance of LEDs based  on RT-synthesized perovskite QDs are   $3.4\\%$    and   $200\\,\\textrm{c d}\\,\\textrm{m}^{-2};$  , far below than that with  QD synthesized by the HI method.   Consequently, it is highly desired to develop  low-cost (e.g., room-temperature) synthetic  method to obtain high-quality, near-per\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant",
