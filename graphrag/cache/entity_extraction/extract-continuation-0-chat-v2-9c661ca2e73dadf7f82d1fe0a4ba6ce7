CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

To achieve high  STH efficiencies in the PEC/PV tandem  systems, the front   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$  photoanode is  required to generate a high photo current  density while also to be sufficiently transparent to allow more photons penetrating  through the   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   film to activate the rear  solar cell.  Practical photo current densities   $(J_{\\mathrm{p}})$   of the   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photo anodes are  mainly determined by the light absorption efficiency   $(\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}})$  , the charge separation  efficiency   $(\\eta_{\\mathrm{sep}})$  , and the charge transfer  efficiency   $(\\eta_{\\mathrm{trans}})$  , that is,   $J_{\\mathrm{p}}=J_{\\mathrm{max}}\\times\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}}\\times$   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{sep}}\\,\\times\\,\\eta_{\\mathrm{trans}}$  .  Recent studies have demonstrated that the nearly maximum   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{trans}}$    of   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photo anodes during oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) can be achieved  when coupled with proper oxygen evo  \n\nBismuth vanadate   $(\\mathsf{B i v o_{4}})$   is a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, owing to the short carrier  diffusion length, the trade-off between sufficient light absorption and efficient charge separation often leads to poor PEC performance. Herein, a new  electrode position process is developed to prepare bismuth oxide precursor  films, which can be converted to transparent   $\\mathsf{B i v o}_{4}$   films with well-controlled  oxygen vacancies via a mild thermal treatment process. The optimized   $\\mathsf{B i v o}_{4}$   film exhibits an excellent back illumination charge separation efficiency mainly due to the presence of enriched oxygen vacancies which act  as shallow donors. By loading FeOOH/NiOOH as the co catalysts, the  $\\mathtt{B i v o}_{4}$    dual photo anodes exhibit a remarkable and highly stable photo current density  of  ${\\sf5.87}\\;\\mathsf{m A}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   at   $\\mathbf{1.23\\,v}$   versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM  1.5 G illumination. An artificial leaf composed of the BiVO 4 /FeOOH/NiOOH  dual photo anodes and a single sealed perovskite solar cell delivers a solar-tohydrogen conversion efficiency as high as  $6.5\\%$   for unbiased water splitting.  \n\nBismuth vanadate   $\\mathrm{(BiVO_{4})}$   has been regarded as one of the  most promising photoanode materials for photo electrochemical \n\n (PEC) water splitting.  With a direct bandgap of   $2.4\\ \\mathrm{eV},$   \n\n  $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   can deliver a theoretical photo current density   $\\left(J_{\\mathrm{max}}\\right)$   of \n\n  $7.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}^{-2}}$   $1.5\\,\\mathrm{~G~}$   illumination   $(100\\,\\mathrm{\\mW\\cm^{-2}})$  ),  corresponding to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of   $9.2\\%.^{[2]}$   Although the bandgap of   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   is slightly  larger than the ideal bandgap of   ${\\approx}2.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$   for PEC water splitting, its conduction band (CB) edge position is located very  close to the   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$   evolution potential, leading to a much lower  onset potential and much higher photo current densities in the  low applied potential region compared to many other state-ofthe-art photoanode materials.  Owing to these advantageous  \n\nlution co catalysts (OECs).  However, it is very challenging to  achieve high   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}}\\times\\eta_{\\mathrm{sep}}$   in the transparent   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photoanode  required for the PEC/PV tandem systems, because   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}}$   and   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{sep}}$   are coupled: thicker   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   films generally result in higher   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}}$   while lower   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{sep}}$  , and vice versa. For instance, Zhong et al.  recently reported a new type of highly crystalline  $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   films as  photo anodes which were efficient for solar-driven water splitting with semi transparency feature.  How to further improve  film transparency while keeping high photo current densities  of   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photo anodes to achieve high STH efficiencies in the  PEC/PV tandem systems remains challenging.  \n\nHerein, we report an innovative electrode position and subsequent calcination process to fabricate highly transparent   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photo anodes with enriched oxygen vacancies. The dual   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photo anodes composed of two identical transparent  $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$    films exhibit an extraordinary high photo current density of   $6.22\\,\\mathrm{\\mA{~cm}^{-2}}$   at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the presence of   $\\mathrm{Na}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{3}$   under AM   $1.5\\ \\mathrm{G}$   illumination, corresponding to a high   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}}\\times\\eta_{\\mathrm{sep}}$   value of   $83\\%$  . By  loading FeOOH/NiOOH as OECs, the dual   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photo anodes  exhibit an excellent photo current density of   $5.87~\\mathrm{mA~cm}^{-2}$   at   $1.23\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE and a high applied bias photon-to-current  efficiency (ABPE) of   $2.2\\%$   at   $0.7\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$  versus RHE under AM   $1.5\\,\\mathrm{~G~}$   illumination for PEC water splitting. The PEC performance achieved in this work is the highest among the   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$    photo­ anodes without sensitize rs or noble metals.  By coupling with a sealed perovskite solar cell in the back of the dual  photo anodes, a   $6.5\\%$   STH efficiency for unbiased PEC water  splitting is achieved. The strategy of creating oxygen vacancies  to improve the   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{sep}}$   and the design of dual photo anodes to  enhance the  $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}}$   provides a new approach for the design of efficient photo electrodes for unbiased PEC water splitting.  \n\nTo design high-performing   $\\mathrm{BiVO_{4}}$   photoanode thin films,  we first developed an innovative electrode position method to  grow bismuth precursor films (BPFs) on fluorine-doped   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  (FTO) glass substrates in a three-electrode cell with an aqueous  solution containing Bi (III) ions (details shown in the Experimental Section, Supporting Information). Upon the application of   $2.82\\,\\mathrm{~V~}$   versus RHE, grey bismuth metal powder was  grown on the Pt electrode (Figure S1a, Supporting Information), while transparent BPFs with brown color were successfully deposited on the FTO substrates (Figure S1b, Supporting  Information). The as-prepared BPFs are amorphous, since no  obvious peaks can be detected in the X-ray diffraction (XRD)  patterns in addition to the FTO signals (Figure S1c, Supporting Information). After calcination at   $500~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for   $2\\textrm{h}$  , the  amorphous BPFs were converted to crystalline bismuth oxide  films composed of\n######################\noutput:\n"},
