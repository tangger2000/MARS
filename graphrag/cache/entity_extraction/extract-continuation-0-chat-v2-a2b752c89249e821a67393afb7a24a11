Introduction  \n\nThe improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the  perovskite solar cell (PSC) is hindered by carrier recombination originating  from the defects at the buried interface of the PSC. It is crucial to suppress  the non radiative recombination and facilitate carrier transfer in PSC via  interface engineering. Herein, P-big u any l benz oic acid hydrochloride (PBGH)  is developed to modify the tin oxide   $(\\mathsf{S n O}_{2})_{l}$  /perovskite interface. The effects  of PBGH on carrier transportation, perovskite growth, defect pass iv ation,  and PSC performance are systematically investigated. On the one hand, the  PBGH can effectively passivate the trap states of Sn dangling bonds and  O vacancies on the  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   surface via Lewis acid/base coordination, which  is conducive to improving the conductivity of  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   film and accelerating  the electron extraction. On the other hand, PBGH modification assists  the formation of high-quality perovskite film with low defect density due  to its strong interaction with   $\\mathsf{P b I}_{2}$  . Consequently, the PBGH-modified PSC  exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of  $\\mathbf{24.79\\%}$  , which  is one of the highest PCEs among all the  $\\mathsf{F A C s P bI}_{3}$  -based PSCs reported to  date. In addition, the st abilities of perovskite films and devices under high  temperature/humidity and light illumination conditions are also systematically studied.  \n\nOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar  cell (PSC), whose power conversion efficiency (PCE) has surged from   $3.8\\%$   to   $25.7\\%,^{[1-4]}$   has attracted tremendous attention of researchers and made vigorous  progress in the past few years owing to  its charming op to electronic characteristics.  Planar perovskite solar cell is  considered as a promising commercial  approach due to its small current-voltage   $(I{-}V)$   hysteresis, easy processing, and low  energy consumption.  The most widely  employed electron transport layer (ETL)  materials for the state-of-the-art regular  planar PSCs are tin oxide   $(\\mathrm{SNO}_{2})$   and titanium dioxide. Among them,   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   substrate exhibits better performance thanks  to its higher electron mobility, lower  processing temperature, better energy  band alignment, and inert photo catalytic  activity.  However, there still exists some  problems restricting the efficiencies and  st abilities of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -based PSCs. On the  one hand, the O vacancies and Sn dangling bonds with low formation energy  \n\ncommonly exist on the surface of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   prepared under  ambient conditions.  These defects will capture   $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$    in the ambient atmosphere and form potential barriers to  hinder the transmission of electrons.  On the other hand, it  is reported that perovskite film prepared by solution method  contains extensive defects at the ETL/perovskite interface.  The shallow level defects of under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   and iodine  vacancies tend to affect the stability of the perovskite film, while  the deep level defects like   $\\mathrm{Pb_{I}}$   anti-site defects will act as nonradiative recombination centers, resulting in voltage loss   $(V_{\\mathrm{loss}})$    and PCE reduction of devices.  \n\nIn order to facilitate the charge transportation and improve  the photovoltaic performance of the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  -based PSCs, enormous efforts have been made to suppress the trap states  at  the buried interface.  Given that the functional groups  of organic compounds can interact with the trap states on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   surface and bond with the perovskite layer, the interfacial modification of organic molecules is regarded as an effective strategy to restrain the defects at the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/}$  perovskite  interface.  Heparin potassium (HP) was introduced to  regulate the arrangement of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano crystals and induce  crystal growth of per ovsk ites.  HP can passivate the   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$   via  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/23/b4e809c388fafc940bd0f0dd44f8b62b3d862313d219d8d136725a0db026be0e-1727105929.jpg)  \nFigure   1.   a) Schematic diagram of the PBGH modification process. b) Top-view SEM with contact angle images, c) AFM images for   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}/$  PBGH films (on glass/FTO substrates). d) Top-view SEM, e) AFM, and f) contact angle images for perovskite and PBGH/perovskite films (on glass/ FTO/  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   substrates).  \n\nCOO-Sn interaction and has strong chemical affinity toward  under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  . 1-adamant a ne acetic acid (ADAA) was  applied by Zhou et  al. and the PSC based on ADAA exhibits  a champion PCE of   $23.18\\%$  , since the   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   in ADAA can passivate the oxygen vacancies and under coordinated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   at the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}/}$  /perovskite interface.  Dong and coworkers developed  an organic molecule 2,4,5-trich l oro benzene s ulf onic potassium  (3Cl-BSAK) to modify the ETL/perovskite interface, yielding a  PCE of   $24.27\\%$  .  They illustrated that when the 3Cl-BSAK acts  on the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film, the   $_{\\mathrm{C-Cl}}$   with high electron cloud density  will interact with   $\\mathrm{Sn^{4+}}$  , contributing to facilitated carrier transport, and the   $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{S=O}}$   donates a pair of nonbonding electrons to  coordinate with   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$  . These works have achieved satisfactory  results in using organic molecules as buried interface passivators. However, these molecules can passivate limited defect  types, which hinders the further improvement of device performance. Therefore, it is essential to develop a comprehensive defect pass iv ation strategy that can not only improve the  perovskite quality but also have strong interaction with   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   to  regulate the carrier dynamics.  \n\nIn this work, a type of small molecule P-big u any l benz oic  acid hydrochloride (PBGH) was introduced to modify the  buried   $\\mathrm{subseteqO}_{2i}$  /perovskite interface. Importantly, PBGH has  abundant functional groups ( Figure   1 a), which is conducive to  maximizing its potentials in inter facial defect pass iv ation. The  effects of PBGH on carrier transfer, perovskite growth regulation, defect pass iv ation at the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2/}}$  perovskite interface, as well  as PSC device performance were systematically investigated. It  is demonstrated that PBGH can passivate the trap states of Sn  dangling bonds and O vacancies on the   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   surface via Lewis  acid/base coordination, and has strong interaction with   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   to  improve the perovskite film quality. The modification of PBGH  enables improved PCE as high as   $24.79\\%$   compared to   $22.85\\%$    for the control device. In addition, the un encapsulated device  based on PBGH maintained over   $95\\%$   of the initial PCE after   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$   storage in ambient condition with a relative humidity  (RH) of   $25\\%$  .
