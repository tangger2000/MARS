CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

However, due to the highly textured nature of these films the  lab-based XRD measurements which only probe out-of-plane  scattering miss the key 2D peaks that appear in-plane, as  reported in the literature.  \n\nThe above information allows us to form a clear understanding of the unique structure of our quasi-2D perovskite  films, as illustrated in Figure  3c. Although the mechanism  is not clear, the introduction of 3BBAI actually induces the  oriented growth of small $_{,n}$   per ovsk ites perpendicular to the  substrate, following by the order crystallization of large $_{,n}$  components at top. The large $\\cdot n$   components with high crystallinity in the upper region are advantageous for low-energy  solar photon capture and exciton dissociation due to narrow  energy gap and small exciton binding energy. Moreover, the  large $_{,n}$   per ovsk ites form smooth and continuous film surface,  minimizing the leakage current of the device. The small $_{,n}$  components with vertical orientation in the lower region facilitate the rapid transport of photo generated carriers across the  perovskite films, following by efficient extraction of hole or  electron transport layers, respectively.  Therefore, our quasi2D perovskite solar cell show a wide and high IPCE spectrum,  as well as a high FF.  \n\nTo further understand the origin of our robust device  performance, we compared quasi-2D perovskite films and  devices based on benz yl ammonium iodide (BAI) and 3BBAI.  Figure S3 (Supporting Information) exhibits the SEM images  of the quasi-2D perovskite films made from BAI and 3BBAI.  Two films show the densely packed micrometer-scale crystalline grains. However, the BAI perovskite film has pinholes  and the 3BBAI counterpart does not, indicating that 3BBAI  compared to BAI can improve the morphology of quasi-2D  perovskite films. GIWAXS data analysis of the BAI perovskite  film (Figure  S4, Supporting Information) suggest a similar  layered structure with characteristic 2D peaks again appearing  at higher values of   $\\alpha$  . The low $\\cdot q$   2D peaks appear at slightly  higher   $q$   values   $(q=3.8\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$  ,   $7.5~\\mathrm{nm^{-1}}$  ) consistent with the  slightly smaller spacing between 2D sheets. The BAI perovskite  film shows again a large degree of texture, but with the presence of a population of large $_{,n}$   crystal lites that are randomly  oriented indicated by the coexistence of isotropic rings and  well-defined peaks. The film stability was examined by exposing  the quasi-2D perovskite films to a high relative humidity level  of   $90\\%$   and recording their XRD data (Figure  S5, Supporting  Information). Upon humidity exposure for   $10\\,\\mathrm{\\min}$  , the XRD  pattern of the BAI perovskite film shows an obvious   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   diffraction peak, but the 3BBAI perovskite film still illustrates an  unchanged XRD pattern even after   $60~\\mathrm{min}$  , indicating its outstanding stability against moisture. We believe that the halogen  substituent of 3-b romo benz yl ammonium iodide plays a key  role in improving the stability of our perovskite films, presumably due to its hydrophobic nature and the film with pinholefree morphology and good crystal lin it y. The UV–vis absorption  spectra in Figure  S6 (Supporting Information) show that the  light absorption of the 3BBAI perovskite film in the range of   $300{-}800\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   is slightly weaker than that of the BAI counterpart,  but the overall absorption difference is not significant. We further investigated the photovoltaic performance of quasi-2D perovskite solar cells made from BAI and 3BBAI, respectively. As  shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information), the 3BBAI-based  devices show greater performance than the BAI-based devices.  We note that the BAI devices based on BAI, MACl, and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$    with molar ratio of 2:2:3 and 2:3:4 exhibit   $11.50\\%$   and   $13.33\\%$    average efficiency, respectively, which are comparable to that  reported in the literature.  \n\nImportantly, the high quality quasi-2D perovskite film with  unique structure not only enhance FF and   ${\\cal J}_{\\mathrm{sc}},$   but also make  an important contribution to the high   $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$   of our devices due  to minimization of non radiative recombination processes.  We quantified the non radiative recombination losses according  to the external quantum efficiency   $(\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}})$   of electro lu minescence (EL) by operating a solar cell as a LED.   Figure  4 a  depicts the relationship of both current density and radiance  with voltage for the perovskite LED with a low turn-on voltage  of   $1.25~\\mathrm{V}.$  . The near-infrared EL emission peaked at   $\\approx\\!760~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   is  also shown in the inset of Figure 4a. The current density and  EL increase rapidly along with the bias voltage, implying good  charge transport of the quasi-2D perovskite film. A peak brightness of 192.1  W   $\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$   is obtained under a driving voltage  of   $2.85\\,\\mathrm{\\:V},$   which is comparable to the highest radiance of the  reported near-infrared (NIR) perovskite LED.  As shown in  the inset of Figure 4b, the   $\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}$   of  $\\mathord{\\cdot}\\!\\approx\\!1.5\\%$   is chosen at an injection current that is equal to the photo current of   $18.22\\,\\mathrm{mA}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  .  We estimate the non radiative losses   $(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{oc,nonrad}})$   of the photovoltage according to the formula  \n\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{oc,nonrad}}\\,{=}\\,{\\frac{k T}{e}}\\ln\\,\\mathrm{EQE_{EL}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $k$   is Boltzmann constant,   $T$   is the temperature, and   $e$  is the elementary charge. The   $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{oc,nonrad}}$   is calculated to be   ${\\approx}0.11\\ \\mathrm{V},$  , which is one of the lowest reported values in perovskite solar cells.  The low   $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{oc,nonrad}}$   for our device indicates  that the quasi-2D perovskite film has very low bulk and surface  defect density and all major sources of non radiative recombination are strongly suppressed. By the integration of the IPCE  over the blackbody radiation and AM1.5G solar spectra, we estimate the theoretical radiative limit   $\\left(V_{\\mathrm{oc,rad}}\\right)$   of the photo voltage  to be  $\\approx\\!1.35~\\mathrm{V}^{[36,39]}$   According to calculated values of   $V_{\\mathrm{oc,rad}}$   and  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/ba88244aa50bda452b7aa6abba6df0c928accf1b4492e9dfb2ddae534eba076c-1723833644.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   Op to electronic properties of quasi-2D perovskite solar cells measured as LED devices. a) Plots of current density and radiance versus driving  voltage.
