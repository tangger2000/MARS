CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Here, we fabricate  a commercial UV chip   $(365\\,\\mathrm{\\nm})$   pumped warm white-LED  by mixing   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}:S b}$   with the commercial blue phosphor   $\\mathrm{BaMgAl_{10}O_{17}E u^{2+}}$   and green phosphor   $\\mathrm{SrSi}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\mathrm{N}_{2}{:}\\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$  . A warm  white-LED with a Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage  CIE coordinate of (0.40, 0.38), correlated color temperature  (CCT) of   $3416\\mathrm{~K},$  , and the color rendering index (CRI) of 95.4 is  obtained (Figure S18a,b, Supporting Information).  \n\nMeanwhile, a NIR-LED device can be fabricated by combining   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6};\\mathrm{Pb},\\mathrm{Yb}$  b with a commercial   $365~\\mathrm{~nm~}~\\mathrm{UV}$  chip (Figure S19a, Supporting Information). The pc-LED  emits a much stronger NIR emission than visible emission.  A slight spectral deviation between the lamp and the phosphor is related to the calibration difference of the used spectrometers. With the increase of the driving current from 20  to   $300~\\mathrm{mA}$  , a linear increase of the NIR emission intensity is  observed, with no premature saturation toward the UV light  excitation (Figure S19b, Supporting Information). The as-fabricated NIR-LED device with strong NIR luminescence makes  it suitable as the light source for night-vision technologies. As  can be seen in  Figure   5 a–c, printed paper is clear under natural light (Figure 5a). When the natural light is off, no image  can be captured by the NIR camera (Figure  5b). By contrast,  once the NIR LED is ignited, a black-and-white image with  clear Chinese characters can be recorded by the NIR camera \n\n (Figure 5c). Therefore, these results reveal great potential of the \n\n  $\\mathrm{Stb}^{3+}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$   co-doped   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$   phosphor in night-vision technologies and other related fields including medical and food  industries.  \n\nFurthermore,   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AglnCl}_{6}\\mathrm{:St}$    combined  with   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6};\\mathrm{Pb},\\mathrm{Yb}$   can be used for information encryption  patterns. As shown in Figure  5d-f, we designed information encryption patterns by screen printing   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}$  :Sb  (QR code) and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}\\mathrm{;St}_{1}\\mathrm{b},$   (pattern) to form a composite pattern. The pattern composed of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}:S b}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}\\mathrm{;St}_{1}\\mathrm{b},$   is invisible under daylight to the human  eye or visible camera (Figure 5d). However, once placed under  UV light, a QD code pattern composed of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{2}A g I n C l_{6}:S b}$   is  presented and can be captured by visible camera (Figure  5e),  while a pattern composed of   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{AgInCl}_{6}\\mathrm{;St}_{1}\\mathrm{b},$   can be detected  by NIR camera (Figure 5f). This strongly supports their unique  advantages for visible and NIR multi-mode optical information  encryption.  \n\n# 3.

Profiting from the bright STE emission and better resonance with   $\\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$   ions, the highest NIR PLQY of up to   $50\\%$    is realized by efficient energy transfer from STEs to   $\\Upsilon\\mathsf{b}^{3+}$    ions.
