CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

Carbon nanotube fibers/graphene  fibers have been demonstrated as good candidates as the outer  electrodes, however, their conduct iv i ties are less satisfying   $(\\approx\\!10^{3}\\:\\mathrm{~S~}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ), especially in meters-long. Moreover, neither  metal nor carbon-based electrodes are transparent. As transparent electrodes are always desired in op to electronics, developing transparent flexible highly conducting materials are  of great importance in wearable photodetector s. Attempts  like Ag nanowires/PDMS composite materials have shown  some potentials, with Ag network as the conducting phase  and polymer as the flexible matrix, future studies may further  improve the conduct iv i ties of the composite materials while  keeping the transparency through nano structure and microstructure design.  \n\nFor a wearable PD, other than flexibility, more stringent  requirements need to be met. To effectively operate a wearable  PD and acquire useful information, the integration of PDs with  other electronic devices in the system is indispensable. On the  one hand, as the current wearable power supplies cannot fulfill  the need of portable electronic systems, self-powered features  are highly desired for PDs. Strategies such as integration with  solar cells and construction of a   $\\mathrm{p-n}$   junction have been demonstrated successfully. On the other hand, the commercially  miniature data processing and transmitting chips typically  require a threshold current of  ${\\approx}1\\;\\mathrm{mA}$   at a low bias   $(<\\!5\\mathrm{~V})$  , while  the photo current of most PDs in literature are far behind. To  get a higher photo current, MSM structure and photo-FETs are  two main approaches to obtain a high photogain.  \n\nAs for the applications, wearable photodetector s can be  mainly categorized into three groups: monitoring, imaging,  and optical communications.  \n\nIn wearable monitoring systems, internal signals (human  body) and external signals (ambient environment) are the two  primary directions. For health monitoring, photodetector s are  generally integrated with LEDs with constant power densities to detect biological signals of human body, such as heart  rate, heart rate variability, and oxygenation, which are primary  indicators of the health condition of a person. Conformal contact with the skin or nails is generally required for the wearable devices to obtain a stable and reliable measurement. And  the environment light needs to be deducted for the accuracy  of results. Thus, ultra flexibility and a high signal-to-noise ratio  are particularly important for a wearable PD in this scenario.  For monitoring the real-time UV intensity in ambient environment, as UV-B is believed to be a major etiologic agent in most  skin cancers or diseases, a few reports have shown potential as  real-time wearable UV alerts through visible color changes or  intensity variations read on cell phones. However, for the readthrough-color, it is not reliable especially one wants to know  the exact UV intensity. For the read-through-numbers on smart  phones, the bulky and heavy data transmitter and processor are  not compatible with the thin, flexible and wearable UV PDs.  On the one hand, further improvement of the photo current of  UV PDs and self-powered characteristics will free the devices  from amplifiers and additional power sources. One the other  hand, with the advance of flexible electronic circuits, a fully  portable, flexible, and wearable UV monitoring system may be  envisioned.  \n\nFor wearable imaging systems, visible and NIR PDs are  particularly important. A few examples have demonstrated the  preliminary wearable imaging recognition system with the size  of   $10^{*}10$   pixels, or tried to explore new functions such as biomimetic visual memory system by integrating PDs with memristors. However, it is still hard to realize a more sophisticated  and accurate imaging recognition system due to the possible  signal interference and short circuits, especially under bending  or stretching. On the other hand, color display, as an indispensable component in display, has witnessed some progress in  wearable systems. That is direct color display, which directly  switches the generated electrical signals as color changes  and avoids additional electronic components mostly based on  electro chromic effect.  The electro chromic display is well  adapted to low-cost flexible substrates like paper.  Thus, it  not only simplifies the wearable system fabrication but also  becomes very suitable for special working environments like  gaseous mine, where electric output is highly limited for  safety. Despite of these developments, the wearable data display still suffers from monolithic image output, which requires  advances in compatible integrated circuits and flexible display  screens.  Further advances on the flexible control circuits,  device layouts, compatible and effective fabrication methods,  and encapsulation techniques may aid to improve the geometry accuracy of wearable imaging and realize full color flexible  display.  \n\nFor wearable optical communication, IR PDs play a dominant role in versatile applications, including remote control,  data communication, radar systems, and even to future wearable “Internet of Things.” As IR PDs typically have a threeterminal device structure, elaborated design is needed when  introducing the gate electrode in the flexible electronic systems. In other words, for flexible IR PDs, both the preparation methods and integration techniques with other electronic  devices become more complicated in contrast to the stacking  or planar two-terminal PDs. Further exploration of organic IR  sensitive materials and utilization of the interlaced textile structure in the fiber-shaped IR device may serve as a way to address  those challenges.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nS.C. and X.J.X. contributed equally to this work.
