CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is well known that a pair  of enantiomers hase identical achiral properties like melting  point, boiling point, and density. However, in the case of   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF, there is   $9.8~\\mathrm{K}$   difference between their   $T_{\\mathsf{c}},$   although the  melting point is the same (Figure S4, Supporting Information).  Consequently, besides chirality,   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF can also be distinguished by phase transition temperature. It is also worth  noting that their racemic mixture  rac -LIP, exhibits no phase  transition before the melting point (Figure S5, Supporting  Information), although it has the 2D perovskite structure as  well. The phase transitions of the enantiomers were further  confirmed by the remarkable dielectric anomalies at around   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$    (Figures 3b,d). The large change of the real part   $(\\varepsilon^{\\prime})$   of the complex dielectric constant at   $1\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$   near   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$   is the characteristic of  a ferroelectric transition.  \n\nWe tried to determine the high-temperature crystal structure of   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF above   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$  , but the diffraction in the hightemperature phase (HTP) is too weak. The weak diffraction is  probably due to the   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$   close to the melting point (Figure S4,  Supporting Information). We thus carried out variable-temperature PXRD measurements for   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF (Figure S6, Sup- porting Information). The number of the diffraction patterns  in the HTP is obviously less than that in the room-temperature  phase (RTP) below   $T_{\\mathsf{c}},$   suggesting a higher symmetry. The  Pawley refinements of the PXRD data in HTP reveal that both  R - and  S -LIPF have a tetragonal cell with one of the most possible space group of   $P422$   (Figure S6, Supporting Information).  The twisted lattice and the octahedron in RTP can be restored  to the tetragonal lattice and the octahedron with   $C_{4}$   symmetry,  respectively (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Both the   ${\\mathrm{PbI}}_{6}$    octahedron and the organic ammonium cations can become  disordered to satisfy the symmetry for the  P 422 space group  (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information). Therefore, the  space group  P 422 for HTP is possible.  \n\nSecond harmonic generation (SHG) effect is a useful  method to detect the inversion symmetry in crystals. At room  temperature, both   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF are SHG-active with detectable intensity about half that of   $\\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{4}$   (KDP) while  rac -LIP  is SHG-inactive ( Figure   4 , inset), consistent with the noncentro symmetric   $P1$   and centro symmetric   $P2_{1}/c$   space groups.  When increasing the temperature, the SHG intensity in both  enantiomers decreases gradually below   $T_{\\mathsf{c}},$   and reaches zero  above   $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$   (Figure  4). According to the Kleinman’s symmetry  transformation, besides the 11 centro symmetric point groups,  the three non centro symmetric point groups 422, 622, and  432 are also SHG-inactive.  Considering the homochirality  of the enantiomers, the high-temperature phase should adopt  a chiral point group. In addition, the layered   $\\mathrm{[Pbl_{4}]^{2-}}$   framework in the structure has the highest symmetry of fourfold  axis. Thus, the high-temperature structures of the enantiomers  belong to the chiral but SHG-inactive 422   $(D_{4})$   point group, in  accordance with the structural analysis.   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF show  a same piezoelectric coefficient   $d_{33}$   value of   $3\\ \\mathrm{pC}/\\mathrm{N}$   along the  (001) direction at room temperature (Figure S10, Supporting  Information), which further confirms the non centro symmetric  P 1 space group in RTP. From Aizu rule on ferroelectric phase  transition,  that in   $R\\cdot$   and  S -LIPF is classified as the species  of 422 F 1, where the symmetry elements decrease from eight  ( E ,   $2C_{4}$  ,   $C_{2}$  ,   $2C_{2}^{\\,\\prime}$  , and   $2C_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}$  ) in para electric point group 422 to  one   $(E)$   in ferroelectric point group 1, revealing a multiaxial feature with eight re orientable polarization directions and eight  equivalent ferroelectric axes.  \n\nPiezo response force microscopy (PFM) has emerged as a  powerful characterization tool for the study of ferroelectric  polarization at the nanometer scale.   Figure    5  presents the  PFM amplitude and phase images in both vertical (out-of-plane)  and lateral (in-plane) components for the film surface of  R -LIPF  over an area of   $10\\,\\times\\,10\\,\\,{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}^{2}$  . It is clear that the ferroelectric  domains are represented by the characteristic banded domain  structures of herringbone patterns, like those in   $[\\mathrm{Me}_{3}\\mathrm{NCH}_{2}\\mathrm{Cl}]$   $\\mathrm{MnCl}_{3}$  .   The  emerging  herringbone-shaped  domains  are formed by four kinds of domains that have different  polarization directions. From the vertical component, different  phase contrasts mean the existence of at least two domains  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/2fc0a5b848c75066ae429cefcd2788fd7d02e25fa3797a59df5d47ab0dcf06b5-1727122959.jpg)  \nFigure 3.
