CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Therefore, it is very important to control  the radii of the constituent ions to make a stable cubic perovskite structure. Considering the effective radii of halogen  anions (  $\\cdot\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$  : 167 pm;   $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$  : 182 pm; I − : 206 pm),   $\\mathrm{{\\small~\\sf~MAPbCl}}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   have cubic structure and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   has tetragonal  structure at room temperature.  Due to the unstable  tetragonal structure of   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}$  ,   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   PeSCs exhibit signi­ ficant degradation at relative humidity (RH)  $\\geq55\\%$  , whereas  MAPb  $(\\mathrm{Br}_{x}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{I}_{1-x}})_{3}$   PeSCs retained their initial power conversion  efficiency (PCE) for   $20\\,\\mathrm{~d~}$   (at room temperature,   $\\mathrm{RH}\\,=\\,55\\%$  for a day and  $35\\%$   for the rest of days, without encapsulation)  when   $x\\ge0.2$   (cubic structure).  \n\n# 2.1.2. Influence of Temperature on Stability  \n\nThe MHP emission layer in PeLEDs must be thermally stable,  because it may experience high temperatures during fabrication and device operation (Joule heating),  and because  PeLEDs may be used outdoors.  \n\nThe most frequently used A-site cation in MHPs is the   $\\mathrm{MA^{+}}$   cation. Representative ly,   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   have  been used as emission layers to fabricate high-efficiency  green  and infrared  PeLEDs, respectively. However, under thermal stress,   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$   can suffer from severe  degradation by the following decomposition pathways (P1)  and (P2)  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}P b X_{3}\\left(s\\right)\\rightarrow P b X_{2}\\left(s\\right)\\mathrm{+\\,CH_{3}N H_{2}\\left(g\\right)\\mathrm{+\\,H X\\left(g\\right)}}}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}N H_{3}P b X_{3}\\left(s\\right)\\rightarrow P b X_{2}\\left(s\\right)+\\ C H_{3}X\\left(g\\right)+\\ N H_{3}\\left(g\\right)}\n$$  \n\nThe decomposition pathway of   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$   is still under debate  because the decomposition products from both pathways  have been experimentally measured.  A recent study on  thermal decomposition of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   showed that both of the  decomposition pathways are possible and also depend on  temperature.  Pathway (P2), which is thermodynamic ally  favored over pathway (P1), becomes favorable as temperature  increases because kinetic hindrance of pathway (P2) is mitigated  at high temperatures.  \n\nThermo grav i metric analysis measures weight loss of MHPs  as temperature is increased; the onset of weight loss indicates vol at i liz ation of breakdown products, and is therefore a  measure of the stability of the compound.  MABr begins to  decompose at   $200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  ,  and   $\\mathrm{\\AAPbX}_{3}$   begins to decompose at   $200–300\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$     $(\\approx\\!220\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  ,    ${\\approx}200\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ,    ${\\approx}250\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  , and   ${\\approx}294\\ \\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C}^{[53]}$  for   $\\mathrm{MAPbI}_{3}.$  ). The decomposition onset  temperature of  $200–300\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   may be regarded as thermally stable,  but many researchers have reported that thermal degradation  can occur at temperatures   ${<\\!200~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}}$  .  The optimal annealing  temperature to give the best PCE of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   PeSCs is  $\\approx\\!100\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ;  further increase in this temperature degrades device efficiency  by damaging the MHP layers, as proven by the occurrence of \n\n  $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peaks at temperatures   ${>}120~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   in the X-ray diffraction \n\n (XRD) patterns.  Also, the intensity of   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   peak in XRD patterns of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   films is significantly increased by thermal  annealing at   $140~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\\mathrm{min}$  , whereas the increase is negligible at   $100\\ {}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.^{[60]}$   The thermal degradation of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   layers  can be clearly visualized by conductive atomic force microscopy  (c-AFM) measurement ( Figure   2 ).  Even in a nitrogen atmosphere, the annealing of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   layers at   $85\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $24\\textrm{h}$   was  shown to cause a significant amount of current-less dark area  as a result of the degradation of the   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$  .  These experiments clearly show that   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   is not thermally stable.  \n\n$\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   has a stable cubic crystal structure and higher   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{X}$   bond strength than   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  , and therefore has relatively better thermal stability than   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$  .  Irradiation of  100 suns on   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}}_{3}$   films at elevated temperature of   $45–55\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  reduces its absorption, but   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   films were found to  be stable under the same conditions.  However,   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$  also experiences slight thermal degradation even at   ${<}100~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  .  Increasing the annealing time of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   emission layers  from 10 to   $30\\;\\mathrm{\\min}$   (at   $90~\\mathrm{~}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  ) causes slight sublimation of  MABr and reduces crystal lin it y, and thereby decreases the EL  efficiency of   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$   PeLEDs.  \n\nThe thermal instability of   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   can be  understood by calculating the enthalpy of formation from MAI  (or MABr) and   $\\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$   (or   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  ).  The calculated enthalpies  of formation were   $34.50\\;\\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}}$   for  $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $6.69\\;\\mathrm{kJ\\mol^{-1}}$  for   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{PbBr}_{3}$  .  These positive enthalpies of formation indicate  that   $\\mathrm{\\AA{PbI}_{3}}$   and   $\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{bBr}_{3}$   are thermodynamic ally unstable.
