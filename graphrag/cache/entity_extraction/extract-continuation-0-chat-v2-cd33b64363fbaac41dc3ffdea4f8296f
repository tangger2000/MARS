Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is estimated that the rise time   $(t_{\\mathrm{rise}})$   and decay time   $(t_{\\mathrm{decay}})$   of the 7L  device under laser pulse are 0.4 and   $40~\\mathrm{{ms}}$  , respectively. And  the two time constants extracted by second-order exponential  fitting of the decay curve are 4.2 and   $41.3\\,\\mathrm{\\ms}$  , respectively,  suggesting its outstanding response speed. Interestingly, compared with the TRPL decay curve above, the pulse response of  the SNO PD shows a much longer decay process, implying the  dominant effect of non radiative recombination in SNO sheets  after removing the incident light. Moreover, when tested in  vacuum, the PD yields improved  $I_{\\mathrm{p}}$   as high as  $1\\,\\upmu\\mathrm{A}$   at   $1.0\\;\\mathrm{V}$   bias  and shows 16.2 times the   $R_{\\lambda}$   of that tested in ambient pressure,  while the response time is greatly prolonged (Figure S8, Supporting Information). This phenomenon could be related to the  increased carrier number in vacuum condition where the effect  of surface oxygen adsorption is eliminated.  \n\nThe thickness-dependent properties of 2D materials are of  great importance for the investigation and exploitation of those  atomically thin materials. Herein, the UV photo detecting performance of individual SNO nanosheets with various layer  numbers (4L, 6L, and 7L) is investigated and summarized  (Figure 3; Figures S9–S11, Supporting Information). Due to the  difficulty of ex folia ting and dispersing SNO nanosheets, with  both large size and atomically thin thickness, on substrates  for subsequent device fabrication, SNO PDs with thicknesses  below 4L are not investigated in this work. As is shown in  Figure 3g, the  $I{-}t$   curves of the fabricated SNO PDs at   $1\\;\\mathrm{V}$   bias  show fast response speed and high repeatability toward   $270\\,\\mathrm{nm}$  UV on/off switching. It is observed that the photo current value  increases with the increase of SNO layer number, while SNO  PDs with lower thicknesses have an advantage of extremely low  dark current   $(\\approx\\!10^{-14}\\mathrm{~A})$  . According to   $R_{\\lambda}$   curves in Figure   $3\\mathrm{h}$  ,  all the SNO PDs exhibit obvious cutoff edges at  ${\\approx}310\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   with  their highest   $R_{\\lambda}$   located at   $270\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , indicating that the PDs  share similar bandgap corresponding to the UV region. The  cutoff edges (  $.310~\\mathrm{nm})$   are consistent with the optical bandgap  value measured by UV–vis spectroscopy in Figure 2h (3.9 eV).  And it is noteworthy that all the SNO PDs show narrowband  resp on siv it y, with FWHM values of 26, 32, 30 nm for 4L, 6L,  and 7L PDs, respectively. Besides, the thickness dependence of   $R_{\\lambda}$   is also observed, with the 7L PD showing the highest responsivity, followed by that of 6L and 4L. The higher   $R_{\\lambda}$  of thicker  nanosheets in part results from their higher UV absorption  compared with those with smaller thicknesses.  And previous  reports have developed a resistor network model to explain the  relationship between the resistance of 2D nanosheets and their  thickness. That is, to some extent, the resistance of nanosheets  is reduced with the increase of their thickness, which could also  lead to higher photo current and thus improved   $R_{\\lambda}$  .  The two  factors, along with the carrier mobility discussed later, are possible causes that contribute to the thickness dependence of   $R_{\\lambda}$  .  More figures of merit of SNO PDs with various thicknesses,  including   $D^{*}$   and EQE, are available in Figure S11 (Supporting  Information). Furthermore, the relationship between photocurrent of SNO PDs and incident power density is investigated, and the plots in Figure  3i could be well fitted by the  power-law relationship,   $I_{\\mathrm{p}}\\,\\approx\\,P^{\\alpha}$  . The exponent  a  for 4L PD is  close to 1, indicating its near-linear dependence, while 6L  and 7L PDs show sublinear relationship   $(a<1)$  . According to  previous studies, a relatively low value of   $a$   denotes high density of surface carrier traps.  It is natural that liquid-exfoliated nanosheets abound in defects and surface traps, which  may contribute to an increased photo conductive gain.  And  because of the high surface-to-volume ratio of 2D nanosheets,  surface defects and traps may provide abundant recombination  centers, which contributes to the fast decay speed of the PDs  when UV light is switched off.  In general, few-layer SNO  nanosheets exhibit outstanding and thickness-dependent UV  photo detecting performance, proving SNO a promising candidate for high-performance UV PDs.  \n\nWith the aim of getting insightful understanding and further controlling the carrier transport properties of SNO, SNO  nanosheet–based back-gate field-effect transistors (FETs) are  fabricated on heavily doped Si substrate with an oxidation  layer and characterized by three-terminal measurements. As is  shown in  Figure    4 b, the transfer characteristics of SNO with  various thicknesses suggest the n-type nature of SNO. And the  threshold voltages for electron conduction of 4L, 6L, and 7L  SNO transistors are measured to be 3.6, 5.4, and   $8.5\\;\\mathrm{V},$   respectively, showing an increasing trend with increasing nanosheet  thickness. According to transfer curves, the field-effect carrier  mobility   $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}})$   could be extracted as follows  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{FE}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{\\mathrm{gs}}}\\times\\frac{L}{W V_{\\mathrm{ds}}C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $L$   and   $W$  are channel length and width, and   $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$  is  the oxide layer capacitance per unit area   $(1.2\\,\\times\\,10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{~F~}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/865fae8bf19b804d894cfd98a8a2f21e913de89a57b7e4da00b9a16a81ab138d-1723834934.jpg)  \nFigure 4.   The illustration and performance of SNO nanosheet–based photo transistors. a) The schematic illustration of fabricated photo transistors  based on individual few-layer SNO nanosheets. b) The transfer characteristics of SNO transistors with various thicknesses in dark condition.
