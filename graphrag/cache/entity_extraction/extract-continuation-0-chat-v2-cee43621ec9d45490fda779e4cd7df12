CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Besides the enhanced interface properties,  the aligned crystal growth of the perovskite layer may also contribute to the operational stability of such planar PSCs. We propose that the perovskite layer with vertically distributed large  domains more likely has less or compressive strain within the  film, while the perovskite film based on randomly distributed  small domains may suffer tensile strain.  During the operational stability test at elevated temperatures, the compressive  strain can suppress the formation of halide vacancies and  decelerate ion migration in perovskite, improving the intrinsic  stability of the perovskite layer.  Besides the ion migration,  phase segregation in the mixed-halide perovskite has also been  proved to influence the efficiency and stability of PSCs.  Correlating ion migration and phase segregation with the crystal  quality such as morphology and strains of the per ovsk ites may  benefit the understanding of the long-term stability mechanism  of PSCs in the future.  \n\nFor the devices fabricated on flexible substrates, a bending  cycle test was conducted (Figure 4c). Enhanced mechanical stability of   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  –HP-based flexible cell was also demonstrated, for  which   $93\\%$   of the initial efficiency was retained after 500 bending  cycles. Since all the other components in the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$  -based  cell were the same as those in   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$  –HP-based cell, and the  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/f6d1cf05a613dbc7d6f126591459a372731adb85a2e2901dcdab1b392c95fac1-1723835990.jpg)  \nFigure   4.   Long-term device stability. a) Continuous maximum power point (MPP) tracking for   $\\mathsf{1000\\,h}$   of a high-performance  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}.$   and  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$  –HP-based  planar PSC devices under constant simulated solar illumination   $(\\mathsf{I}00\\;\\mathsf{m W}\\;\\mathsf{c m}^{-2})$  ) with no UV cutoff filter. b) The evolution of the PCE of flexible planar  PSCs using  $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}.$  - and   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2^{-}}\\mathsf{H P}$   as the ETL as a function of bending cycles. The inset shows the schematic of the bending cycle, and the bending  radius is  $3\\ m m$  .  \n\n$\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   film itself was considered possessing high stability as  an inorganic material, it was speculated that the degraded  performance of   $\\mathrm{SnO}_{2}$  -based cells was caused by the failure of  interface contact between   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   and the perovskite layer. This  emphasized the importance of enhancing the interface contact  between the stacked layers in PSCs for further improving the  stability of PSCs. For the enhanced flexural endurance, it is  proposed that the biological polymer of HP can work as glue  among the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   nano crystals, and increase the tenacity of the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   thin films.  \n\nNotably, the high temperature stability of such n–i–p PSCs is  always limited by the delicate organic HTL of Spiro-OMeTAD  with dopants. To obtain stable PSCs against harsher conditions,  such as heat stress at  $65–80\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   or even  ${>}85~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  , strategies to stabilize the organic HTL and relative interfaces will be required.  Particularly, mixing Spiro-OMeTAD with polymer-based HTMs  seem effective for enhancing the stability of PSCs against heat  stress.  Such facile method for modifying the ETL and corresponding interface by a multi functional polymer could also  work for tuning the properties of HTLs. It is anticipated that  incorporating specifically designed polymers to stabilize the  organic HTL will be able to enhance the stability of PSCs at  high temperature without sacrificing the efficiency.  \n\nIn summary, we have introduced a biological polymer of HP  for stabilizing the   $\\mathrm{{SnO}_{2}}$   colloid dispersion and depositing thin  films with regulated arrangement of   $\\mathrm{{subseteq}}_{2}$   nano crystals. It was  found that this strategy was able to strengthen the interface  contact between the ETL and the perovskite layer by inducing  vertically aligned crystal growth of mixed-cation per ovsk ites.  Correspondingly,   $\\mathrm{{SpO}_{2}}$  –HP-based planar PSCs obtained a high  average efficiency of over   $23\\%$   on rigid substrates, and   $19.47\\%$  on flexible substrates. Besides, the cells also demonstrated high  operational stability at their MPP under 1 sun illumination for  over   $1000\\mathrm{~h~}$  . This work provides a facile method to modify the  ETL and interfaces of planar PSCs, toward efficient and stable  perovskite op to electronic devices.  \n\n# Experimental Section  \n\nMaterials : The   $\\mathsf{S n O}_{2}$   colloid dispersion was purchased from Alfa Aesar \n\n (tin (IV) oxide,   $15~\\mathsf{w t\\%}$   in   $\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O}$   colloidal dispersion). Dimethyl form amide \n\n (DMF,   $99.8\\%)$  ), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO,   $99.7\\%)$  ), and chl oro benzene \n\n (CB,   $99.8\\%)$   were purchased from Acros. 4- tert -butyl pyridine (tBP,   $96\\%$  ),  lithium bistri flu oros ulf on yl imide (LiTFSI,   $99.95\\%)$  , and iso prop an ol   $(\\mathsf{I P A},\\mathsf{99}.\\mathsf{99\\%})$   were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The Heparin   $(99.9\\%)$  and KOH   $(99.9\\%)$   were purchased from Aladdin. Lead iodide   $(\\mathsf{P b}|_{2}$  ,   $99.99\\%)$  ), cesium iodide (CsI,   $99.99\\%)$  ), and lead bromine   $(\\mathsf{P b B r}_{2},\\,\\mathsf{98\\%})$  were purchased from TCI. MAI, FAI, MACl, and MABr were purchased  from Yingkou OPV Tech Co., Ltd and Suzhou SolarFlex Tech. SpiroMeOTAD   $(99.5\\%)$   was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology  Corp. Indium tin oxide (ITO) (transmission  ${\\tt>}95\\%$  ) substrates were  purchased from South China Science & Technology Company Limited. All  the materials were used as received unless specified.  \n\nSynthesis of HP : The HP was prepared by using a sol–gel method.   $500\\,\\mathrm{mg}$   heparin was added into  $20\\;\\mathsf{m L}$   deionized water with strong stirring.  KOH was added to this solution and the pH was kept at around 8. After  stirring for  $2~\\mathsf{h}$  , the mixed solution was further heated by oil bath at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  for  $\\mathsf{T}2\\,\\mathsf{h}$   with stirring. Subsequently, the product of HP was dried in vacuum.  \n\nPreparation of Precursor Solutions : The perovskite precursor solution  was prepared by dissolving a mixture of   $\\mathsf{P b l}_{2}$     $(742.2\\:\\mathsf{m g})$  ), FAI   $(224.4\\:\\mathsf{m g})$  ,  MABr   $(16.2~\\mathrm{mg})$  ), MACl   $(20.3\\ \\mathsf{m g})$  , and CsI   $(19.8\\ m g)$   in   $\\mathsf{I}~{\\mathfrak{m}}\\mathsf{L}$  of mixed  solvent of DMF/DMSO (volume ratio of 4:1). The composition of the  perovskite is   $\\mathsf{C s}_{0.05}\\mathsf{F A}_{0.85}\\mathsf{M A}_{0.10}\\mathsf{P b}(\\mathsf{I}_{0.97}\\mathsf\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role":
