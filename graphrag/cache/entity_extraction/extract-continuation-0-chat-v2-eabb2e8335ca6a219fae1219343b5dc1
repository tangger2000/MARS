CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

It is found  that the peak intensity of   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   and   $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$   declines after ABA  incorporation in the perovskite due to the weakened   $\\mathrm{C=O}$   and \n\n  $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$   bonds, which indicates both of the oxygen atoms from \n\n  $\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{C=O}}$   and  $_{\\mathrm{C-O}}$   have strong interactions with   $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$  . Besides, the  density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to  further theoretically reveal the interaction between ABA organic  spacer and quasi-2D per ovsk ites (Figure 1g,h). It is found that  the ABA can coordinate the unsaturated   $\\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}$   through the coordination bond of   $\\mathrm{Pb}{-}\\mathrm{O}$   while only van der Waals interaction  is observed between PEA cation spacer and octahedral layer in  pristine perovskite. Specifically, the deformation charge density of pristine per ovsk ites shows that the valence electrons  are merely gathered and distributed near the separated atoms  (e.g., hydrogen atom from PEA cation and lead atom from the  octahedral layer) in pristine perovskite, indicating there is no  bonding interaction between the PEA cation and perovskite  layer. However, distinct charge transfer between oxygen and  lead atoms is observed for ABA incorporated perovskite. Meanwhile, the distance between oxygen and lead atoms of   $2.54\\,\\mathring\\mathrm{A}$   is  comparable to the sum of their ionic radii of 2.59 Å (oxygen:   $1.4\\:\\mathring\\mathrm{A}$  , lead: 1.19 Å). These results demonstrate a strong interaction between ABA and perovskite layer. Then the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements were carried  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/85aa355a763cc2813d7ef21c01b46d31316285302afcc8a8199547b2c9108893-1723836047.jpg)  \nFigure   2.   Optical properties of the perovskite films: a) The UV–visible absorption spectra and b) steady state photo luminescence of the pristine and  pristine/ABA perovskite films. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy of the perovskite films: c,d) TA spectra at different probe delay times, and  e,f) TA kinetics probed at selected wavelengths (453 and   $481\\ \\mathsf{n m}$  ) for pristine and pristine/ABA perovskite films, respectively.  \n\nout to evaluate the effect of ABA on the perovskite phase orientation and distribution (Figure S3, Supporting Information). It  is observed that the bright scatter halos are presented in both   $q_{\\mathrm{z}}$   and   $q_{\\mathrm{r}}$   directions for pristine and pristine/ABA perovskite  films, indicating both parallelly and vertically oriented quasi-2D  per ovsk ites formed in the films.  The X-ray scattering profiles  along the   $q_{\\mathrm{z}}$   direction of the films were plotted in Figure S4  (Supporting Information). It is found that the pristine/ABA  perovskite film shows the same main characteristic peaks as  compared to that of pristine perovskite film, indicating that the  main perovskite phases remain unchanged by ABA incorporation. Meanwhile, an extra peak at   $0.27~\\tilde{\\mathrm{A}}^{-1}$   appears in pristine/ ABA per ovsk ites, which may be attributed to the interaction of  quasi-2D perovskite layers (Figure S5b, Supporting Information). Overall, we demonstrate a strong interaction between  ABA and perovskite layer through the functional groups of  amino and carboxylic acid, which promotes the coupling of  quasi-2D perovskite layers in the perovskite films. The strengthened interaction between the coupled perovskite phases will  benefit the carrier transfer in the perovskite films as discussed  later.  \n\nThe UV–visible absorption spectra of the pristine and pristine/ABA perovskite films are shown in  Figure   2 a. The absorption spectra show two shoulders at around 428 and   $453\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$    for both pristine and pristine/ABA perovskite films, which are  associated with the   $n=2$   and  $n=3$   layered per ovsk ites, respectively, and a red-tail extending to   ${\\approx}481$    nm corresponding to   $n\\geq4$   perovskite phase.  However, their photo luminescence \n\n (PL) spectra only show a single PL peak centered at   $486\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   \n\n (Figure 2b). Since the photo generated carriers are driven from  a larger bandgap (i.e., low-order) phase to a smaller bandgap  (i.e., high-order) phase, and eventually recombine in high-order  phase due to energy funneling effect, thus the single PL peak  in the quasi-2D perovskite films suggests an energy transfer  from the larger bandgap (i.e.,   $n=2$  ,   $n=3$  ) phase to the smaller  bandgap (i.e.,   $n\\geq4$  ) phase (as illustrated in Figure S6, Supporting Information). To investigate the photo generated ­ carrier  transfer dynamics in the pristine and pristine/ABA perovskites, the ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has  been performed. The TA spectra of pristine and pristine/ABA  per ovsk ites at different timescales are shown in Figure  2c,d,  in which three distinctive photo bleaching (PB) peaks centered  at 428, 453, and   $481~\\mathrm{nm}$   are observed, corresponding to   $n=2$  ,   $n\\ =\\ 3$  , and   $n\\geq4$  phases in consistent with the absorption  spectra. It can be observed that the photo generated carriers  are primarily formed in low order (i.e.,   $n=2$  ,   $n=3$  ) phases  with a fast buildup of   $n=2$   and   $n=3$   PB peaks at the initial  stage (Figure 2c,d). When prolonging the decay time, the loworder PB peaks decrease accompanied with a gradual growth  of the high-order (i.e.,   $n\\geq4)$   PB peak, indicating that the carriers transfer from low order phases to the high-order perovskites. To further study the carrier transfer process, time traces  of low-order (e.g.,   $n=3$  ,   $453\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  ) phase and high-order (e.g.,   $n\\geq4$  ,   $481\\;\\mathrm{nm}$  ) phase are extracted as shown in Figure 2e,f. The  kinetics of each PB can be fitted by a multi exponential function:   $\\Delta A(\\mathrm{t})\\,=\\,a_{1}\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau_{1})\\,+\\,a_{2}\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau_{2})\\,+\\,a_{3}\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau_{3})\\,-\\,c_{1}$   $\\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{et}})$  , where   $a_{1},\\,a_{2},\\,a_{3}$  , and   $c_{1}$   are amplitudes;   $\\tau_{1}$   is the fast  decay time constant due to the carrier transfer process in the  perovskite;   $\\tau_{2}$   and   $\\tau_{3}$   represent the slow decay time constant;  and   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{et}}$   is the formation time constant.  The fitting parameters  were extracted and listed in Table S2 (Supporting Information).  In pristine perovskite, the PB of   $n=3$   phase shows a fast decay  time with   $\\tau_{1}$  of 1.31 ps (Figure 2e). The PB formation time of   $n\\geq4$  phase is 1.63  ps within the timescale of the fast decay  time of   $n=3$   phase, indicating a fast carrier transfer process.  Differently, the PB of   $n=3$   for pristine/ABA per ovsk ites show  a smaller   $\\tau_{1}$   of 0.67 ps (Figure 2f), which is nearly half of that  in pristine perovskite (1.31 ps), implying more efficient carrier  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ABA<|>Reagent<|>Organic spacer used in the perovskite structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Perovskite<|>Product<|>Material structure containing lead and halide ions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pb<|>Reagent<|>Lead ion used in the perovskite structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Halide<|>Reagent<|>Halide ion used in the perovskite structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C=O<|>Functional group<|>Carbonyl group present in the ABA spacer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C-O<|>Functional group<|>Ether group present in the ABA spacer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pb2+<|>Cation<|>Lead cation in the perovskite structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DFT<|>Characterization technique<|>Density functional theory used for theoretical calculations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIXS<|>Characterization technique<|>Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering used to evaluate phase orientation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UV-Vis<|>Characterization technique<|>UV–visible absorption spectroscopy used to analyze optical properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PL<|>Characterization technique<|>Photoluminescence spectroscopy used to analyze optical properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TA<|>Characterization technique<|>Transient absorption spectroscopy used to study carrier dynamics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>n=2<|>Phase<|>Second-layered perovskite phase)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>n=3<|>Phase<|>Third-layered perovskite phase)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>n≥4<|>Phase<|>High-order perovskite phase)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Energy funneling<|>Mechanism<|>Process where carriers transfer from higher bandgap to lower bandgap phases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Carrier transfer<|>Process<|>Movement of charge carriers within the perovskite structure)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABA<|>Perovskite<|>ABA is incorporated into the perovskite structure<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C=O<|>Pb2+<|>The C=O group interacts with Pb2+<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>C-O<|>Pb2+<|>The C-O group interacts with Pb2+<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DFT<|>ABA<|>DFT calculations reveal interactions between ABA and perovskite<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIXS<|>Perovskite<|>GIXS is used to evaluate the phase orientation of perovskite<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UV-Vis<|>Perovskite<|>UV-Vis spectroscopy is used to analyze the optical properties of perovskite<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PL<|>Perovskite<|>PL spectroscopy is used to analyze the optical properties of perovskite<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TA<|>Perovskite<|>TA spectroscopy is used to study carrier dynamics in perovskite<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>n=2<|>Energy funneling<|>n=2 phase is involved in energy funneling<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>n=3<|>Energy funneling<|>n=3 phase is involved in energy funneling<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>n≥4<|>Energy funneling<|>n≥4 phase is involved in energy funneling<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Carrier transfer<|>n=2<|>Carrier transfer occurs from n=2 phase<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Carrier transfer<|>n=3<|>Carrier transfer occurs from n=3 phase<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Carrier transfer<|>n≥4<|>Carrier transfer occurs to n≥4 phase<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
