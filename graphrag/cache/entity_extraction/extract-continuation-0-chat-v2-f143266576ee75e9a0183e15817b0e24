CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s.

As a result, the adopted LiPS promoter in the S cathode effectively regulates the redox reactions  between LiPS and   $\\operatorname{Li}_{2}S$   and hence boosts the electrochemical  performance of Li–S batteries.  \n\nIn summary, we proposed a perovskite promoter in Li–S  batteries to immobilize LiPSs, propel its conversion, and  promote   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   deposition. The PrNPs with intrinsic merits  involving lithio/sul fi phil i city and electro catalytic activities  were employed to regulate   $\\mathrm{LiPS/Li_{2}S}$   redox reactions. The dual  bonding of LiPSs on PrNP through   $\\mathrm{Li-O}$   and   $_{S-S r}$   enhances  the inter facial affinity of LiPSs on perovskite hosts. Therefore,  the PrNPs act as favored nucleation sites to guide the uniform  deposition of   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$  , which is beneficial to reduce cell resistance and render a rapid kinetics of LiPS redox reaction. The  bi functional LiPS promoter in the Li–S cell yields an ultralow  capacity decay rate of   $0.050\\%$   in 400 cycles, significantly  improved rate capability of 753 mA  h   $\\mathsf{g}^{-1}$   at   $2\\textrm{C}$   (threefold  larger than the pristine Li–S cell), and a stable areal capacity  with high S loading   $(2.5{-}5.2~\\mathrm{mg}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$  ) toward practical applications. The presented work affords a fresh strategy to immobilize the LiPS, promote the LiPS conversion, and regulate   $\\mathrm{Li}_{2}S$   deposition through an emerging perovskite promoter in a  working Li–S battery, which is expected to be applied in other  energy conversion and storage devices based on multi electron  redox reaction.  \n\n# Supporting Information  \n\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or  from the author.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nL.K., X.C., and B.-Q.L. contributed equally to this work.
