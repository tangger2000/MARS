CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Along with the  active area of the device, the specific detect iv it y   $(D^{*}\\!)$  , another  figure of merit of the photodetector which is related to the sensitivity that a detector can distinguish from the background noise  can be calculated based on the resp on siv it y and noise. Figure 1f  shows the   $D^{*}$   spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   devices. The  peak   $D^{*}$   of about   $9.7\\times10^{12}$   and   $6.0\\times10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{cm\\W^{-1}\\ H z^{1/2}}$   are  obtained at around 525 and   $515~\\mathrm{nm}$   for  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$  devices, respectively, which are among the highest detect iv it y of  the reported perovskite photodetector s (Table 1).  \n\nPhoto response of the photodetector s under weak light is  studied using the lock-in amplifier. A   $450~\\mathrm{nm}$   LED modulated  with a   $35\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$   square wave is used as the light source. Neutral  density filters and a Si photodetector are used to adjust and  calibrate the light intensities.  Figure   2 a shows the photo current  spectra of the  $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   photodetector under dark and weak light  intensities from   $21.5\\ \\mathrm{pW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   to   $3.17\\;\\mathrm{nW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The currents of  the device under dark at different frequencies are about tens of  fA, which is close to the noise current of the devices shown in  Figure 1e. Sharp peaks at   $35~\\mathrm{Hz}$  , which is the modulation frequency of the incident light, can be found under light, indicating  the current peaks are the signals of photodetector responding  to the incident light. When the incident light intensity is about   $21.5\\ \\mathrm{pW}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , an obvious peak at   $35~\\mathrm{Hz}$   can be distinguished  from the noise floor (inset of Figure 2a), indicating the photo­ detector can detect the weak light as low as   $21.5\\ \\mathrm{pW}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The  current at   $35\\ \\mathrm{\\textrm{Hz}}$   increases linearly with the light intensities  when it increases from  $21.5\\;\\mathrm{pW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   to   $3.17\\;\\mathrm{nW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  .  \n\nThe linear response of a photodetector to the light intensity is a key figure of merit to a photodetector, especially for  use in light measurement and imaging applications. As we  show in Figure 2b,c, to determine the linear response range  of the photodetector, we adjust the incident light intensities from   $\\mathsf{p W}\\ \\mathsf{c m}^{-2}$   to hundreds   $\\mathrm{mW~cm}^{-2}$   and measure the  photo current of the photodetector. The photo current of the  device based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   increases linearly from   $4.6\\times10^{-12}$   to   $4.7\\times10^{-2}$   A   $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   when the incident light intensities increase  from   $2.1\\times10^{-11}$   to   $0.23\\ \\mathrm{W}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  . The results indicate that the  device can keep linear response to the light intensity over about  10 orders of magnitude, corresponding to a linear dynamic  range (LDR) of about 200 dB, which is close to that of previous  reported perovskite photodetector s.  The external quantum  efficiency (EQE) of the photodetector is nearly constant   $(57.1\\%\\,\\pm\\,3.1\\%)$  ) within this light intensity range, which confirms the excellent linear response of the device. As shown in  Figure 2c, photodetector based on   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   also shows excellent  linear response and keeps a nearly constant EQE of   $52.8\\%\\pm$   $4.0\\%$   from   $\\mathtt{p W}\\ \\mathtt{c m}^{-2}$   to hundreds mW   $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  , corresponding a  broad LDR of 194 dB.  \n\nWe characterize the response speed of the AIHP photodetector at 0 bias voltage with a pulsed laser and an oscilloscope.  \n\nTable 1.   Summary of performance of photodetector s based on hybrid perovskite and all-inorganic perovskite. \n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/87b01548e381f604de43e053a0b752f9ef17f31f9e0299d21135cee9236a6465-1723833485.jpg)  \n ${\\mathsf{a}})_{\\mathsf{S C}:}$  : single crystal; NW: nanowire; NS: nanosheet; CNT: carbon nanotube; NP: nanoplate; QD: quantum dot; MC: micro crystal.  \n\nFigure 2d,e shows the transient photo current (TPC) curves of  the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{2}$   and   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   devices with different active areas  from 7.25 to around   $0.1~\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$  .
