CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Constructing  p–n junctions or MSM structures are common ways to endow a  PD with self-powered features. Strategies to make a PD device  wearable include careful selection of substrates and elaborate  design of the device layout, which can be referred to the discussion in Section 2.  \n\nThe research about wearable monitoring based on photo­ detectors has continued to grow in numbers, indicating that  there is an urgent need, but it is still a significant challenge to  realize the integration of real-time wearable data acquisition,  processing, and outputting. In addition, to transform rigid device  into a flexible and portable one is the essence of the problem,  which has already been thoroughly discussed in Section 2.  \n\n# 3.2.

On the one hand, the  ability of quick response (QR) code recognition of wearable  imagers can meet the needs of the information age. On the  other hand, wearable imagers play an important role in special  cases like evidence collection for police and wearable navigation  for blind people. Commercial display screens like cathode ray  tube, plasma display panel, and liquid crystal display are currently incompatible with wearable systems due to the bulk size  as well as the complicated electronic control. Fortunately, wireless signal transmission techniques avoid the physical contact  between photodetector s and external components, which have  catalyzed mature wearable photodetector systems based on  remote display equipment like mobile phones.  \n\nA great number of wearable applications like artificial eyes  have been developed based on wearable imaging systems.  Flexible or bendable photodetector s are usually based on  nano structured materials with photo conductive effect or photo­ voltaic effect. The nano structures not only enable a large specific surface area for a high light absorption, but also enhance  the flexibility due to the micro mechanically compatible structures. Moreover, unlike the flat photodetector s, flexible photodetectors offer excellent facilitation for curve design and show  obvious advantages in omni directional photo detection.  \n\nPlenty of considerable work has been reported in flexible  imaging field, with frequency ranging from UV to   $\\mathrm{THz}$  . In the  research of Li et al.,  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   quantum dot (QD) decorated   $\\mathrm{Zn_{2}S n O_{4}}$    nanowire array displayed excellent flexible UV imaging performance ( Figure    7 a).  The nanowires could stand severe  bending on PET substrate and the flexible   $10\\times10$   device array  maintained nearly the same photo current at a bending angle  of   $150^{\\circ}$  . The type II   $\\mathrm{ZnO/Zn_{2}S n O_{4}}$   he t ero junction delivered  little hindered effect and the photo conductive property was  fully guaranteed with a resp on siv it y gain of   $1.1\\,\\times\\,10^{7}$  , along  with a high specific detect iv it y of   $9.0\\times10^{17}$   Jones and a fast  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/09/24/b80b6464780c727b722aa0e1fdf32137e6b199358f2004024f097ec61746ec81-1727123006.jpg)  \nFigure 7.   Wearable optical imaging systems. a) Wearable UV imager based on  $Z\\mathsf{n O}_{2}$   decorated  $Z\\mathsf{n}_{2}\\mathsf{S n O}_{4}$   nanowires.

Similarly, low-bandgap p-type   $\\mathrm{Sn}S_{2}$   QD  was introduced to replace the   $\\mathrm{ZnO}$   QD for the decoration on   $\\mathrm{Zn_{2}S n O_{4}}$   nanowires (Figure 7b),  which extended the photosensitive range to near infrared (NIR) wavelength and generated broadband flexible photodetector s. The   $\\mathrm{Sn}S_{2}$   QD decorated  photodetector was also reported to exhibit excellent sensitivity,  flexibility, and stability. The UV-to-NIR broadband photosensitivity was further utilized in a flexible   $10\\times10$   photodetector  array to form a 100-pixel imaging system. The flexible imaging  system could recognize targets with both white light and red  light, showing promising applications in flexible broadband  imaging technology.  \n\nWearable THz imaging technology has also gained  increasing attention due to its superb performance in biochemical probing and damage detection. Recently, Suzuki et al.  reported a wearable carbon-nanotube-related THz imager based  on chemical Fermi-level-controlled methods,  which was sufficiently miniaturized to be attached at fingertips and delivered  decent imaging performances.  \n\nAs stated above, great progress has been made in flexible  imagers, both in device design and material innovation. However, the current flexible imagers still cannot meet the commercial needs. Current wearable imagers with merely   $10\\times10$   pixels  cannot satisfy the recognition of the simplest QR codes, not to  mention other applications. Typical QR codes contain   $24\\times24$  to  $117\\times117$   pixels, and wearable imagers should at least excess  this level to achieve basic applications. As for wearable objects  and environment observation, we regard   $72~\\mathrm{dpi}$   as the lowest  acceptable resolution, which is commonly set as the lowest  figure quality in commercial requirements with   $600~\\times~480$  pixels. Taking the fingertip area   $(\\approx\\!2\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2})$   as the proper device  size, the first-generation commercial wearable imagers should  at least reach a pixel density of about   $10^{4}~\\mathrm{{cm}^{-2}}$   to satisfy the  QR code recognition, and the next-generation products should  reach   $1.5\\times10^{5}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$   for basic object photographing. The synthesis of photosensitive nano structures is no longer a bottleneck, but the fabrication of highly integrated detector arrays  along with the electric circuits is still a huge challenge, which  is the key to the scanning process in fast imaging. Real-time  imaging is necessary in some cases, but the perceived image  immediately fades away as the incident signal stops, which is  inconvenient for signal\n######################\noutput:\n"},
