CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.\n\n1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:\nZn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH\n\n2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:\nZr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O\nZr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.\n\nSynthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene.

Time-resolved PL  spectrum (Figure 1d) was measured to gain more insights into  the exciton recombination dynamics. The PL decay can be fitted  by a bi exponential function (Equation (1)), yielding a short lifetime of 7.24 ns   $(\\tau_{1})$   with a percentage of   $75.9\\%$   originated from  the high trap density related to the crystal surface while a long  component of 43.0 ns   $(\\tau_{2})$   with a percentage of   $24.1\\%$   that may  correlate with the carrier recombination in defect-free bulk  crystal  \n\n$$\nF(t)=F_{1}\\exp\\!\\left({\\frac{-t}{\\tau_{1}}}\\right)+F_{2}\\exp\\!\\left({\\frac{-t}{\\tau_{2}}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nIn order to further explore the mechanism of photo lu minescence decay in  $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystals, temperature-dependent  PL spectra were obtained. As previously reported, there are  phase transitions at low temperature for  $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$  , which could  significantly modify the emission properties.  To exclude  this effect, we chose   $160–240\\mathrm{~K~}$   temperature range to analyze  the temperature-dependent PL spectra and the corresponding  pseudo color map is shown in Figure 1e. During this temperature range, the PL peak showed a slightly redshift from 453 to   $457~\\mathrm{nm}$   (Figure S3, Supporting Information). With increasing  temperature, the integrated PL intensity of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   decreases  as more trap states that contribute to non radiative recombination in   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   single crystal were activated after   $200\\,\\mathrm{~K~}$  . To  extract the exciton binding energy, the integrated PL emission  intensity   $(I)$   was plotted as a function of temperature using  Equation (2)  \n\n$$\nI(T)\\!=\\!\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{0}}}{1\\!+\\!A\\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{b}}/k_{B}T)}\n$$  \n\nwhere   $I_{0}$   is the intensity at   $0\\;\\mathrm{~K~}$  ,   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   is the exciton binding  energy, and   $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$   is Boltzmann constant. From the fitting analysis,   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   has a large exciton binding energy   $(E_{\\mathrm{b}})$   of  $\\mathrm{\\Lambda_{\\approx}77.9\\ m e V}$    while   $\\mathrm{MA}_{3}\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Br}_{9}$   exhibits an   $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$   of   ${\\approx}57.1$   meV. Importantly, the  larger exciton binding energy is suggestive of potentially higher  photo luminescence intensity.  \n\nWe next sought to design a green synthesis of Bi-based perovskite QDs. In order to choose a suitable and green solvent, we  compared the permissible exposure limits (PEL) and immediately dangerous to life or health concentration (IDLH) of several solvents.  These solvents were commonly used for the  synthesis of perovskite QDs and their toxicity is summarized in  Figure   2 a. Ethanol exhibits the ideal inter solubility and lowest  toxicity among these solvents and is cost effective, which make  ethanol an excellent choice as the anti solvent in the synthesis  of Bi-based perovskite QDs.

After choosing these two proper solvents, we successfully synthesized   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs by a facile  and green method schematically illustrated in Figure 2b. The  synthesis was conducted by first dissolving CsBr and   $\\mathrm{Big}_{3}$   in  DMSO, and then octylamine (OLAm) was added in this mixture. The precursor solution was added dropwise to the antisolvent–ethanol and little amount of oleic acid (OA), resulting  in controlled crystallization of  $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$  . Furthermore, with the  aid of OLAm and OA, stable colloidal solutions of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$  QDs were prepared. We also used toluene as the anti solvent  for comparison. However, the reaction using toluene produced  QD solution that was unstable and resulted in white precipitates after a few days of storage in ambient conditions, while  QDs prepared by ethanol were still stable and colloid ally well  dispersed (Figure S4, Supporting Information).  \n\nWe systematically optimized the synthesis process and found  that the amount of OA and OLAm sur fact ants plays a more  significant role than the temperature, cooling rate, or reaction  time during the synthesis (Figure S5, Supporting Information).  In addition, to verify our controllable synthesis, QDs  with different sizes were also achieved by tuning the reaction  temperature as absorption peak redshifted with increasing reaction temperature. The relative PLQY of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs made  in different conditions is stated in Figure 2c. Every PLQY in  this figure was divided by the highest PLQY in each condition.  When the amount of OA was lower than   $0.3~\\mathrm{mL}$  , large particles  would precipitate due to the aggregation of QDs. The amount  of OLAm had little impact onto the PL intensity but controls the  yield of QDs to a degree. Appropriate temperature and cooling  ratio can enhance the PL intensity. The highest PL intensity in  the QD products was achieved by adding   $33~\\upmu\\mathrm{L}$   OLAm into the  precursor solution and   $0.5~\\mathrm{mL}$   OA in ethanol, with a reaction  temperature at   $80~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   for   $10~\\mathrm{min}$  , and finally cooling down to  room temperature in air.  \n\nThe absorption and photo luminescence spectra of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$  QDs are shown in Figure 2d. The inset images showed the  QD solutions in ambient and under a   $325\\ \\mathrm{nm}\\ \\mathrm{UV}$   lamp illumination. The absorption curve showed that the exciton peak  of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs is around   $396~\\mathrm{{nm}}$  . In the PL spectrum, an  emission peak at   $410\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   with an FWHM of   $48\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$   can be  observed. The sample has a relatively small Stokes shift of   ${\\approx}15\\ \\mathrm{nm}$   (107 meV), implying that the PL emission of QDs originates from direct exciton recombination.  The fluorescence  peak of QDs showed a notable   $60~\\mathrm{{nm}}$   blueshift compared with  that of single crystal, suggestive of the strong quantum confinement effect. The excitation peak of   $\\mathrm{Cs_{3}B i_{2}B r_{9}}$   QDs is located at   $332\\;\\mathrm{nm}$\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>bulk
