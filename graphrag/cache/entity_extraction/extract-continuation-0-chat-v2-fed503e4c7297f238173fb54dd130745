Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a.

However, the PLQY of wetchemistry synthesized QDs at RT is relatively  low compared with that synthesized through  the HI process.  Meanwhile, the products accompanied by large particles are not  ideal for assembling high-quality films, thus  leading to poor device performance.

The  tetra oct yl ammonium bromide (TOAB), didodec yl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB),  and octanoic acid (OTAc) synergistic ligands  make QDs with high ink stability and ideal  emissive properties, including the high PLQY  of   ${\\tt>}90\\%$   and unity radiative decay (singleexponential decay with the best value for a  goodness-of-fit   $(\\chi^{2})$   of 0.986) in the intrinsic  channel. Meanwhile, the use of short ligands  enables the production of thin films with  effective charge injection and transportation features. In addition, a small amount  of organic form amid in i um (FA) cation was  implemented as a dopant to further improve  the PL of films and to reduce defect trapping  to enhance efficiency of exciton recombination. Importantly, the robustness of highly  \n\nluminescent properties and effective electrical injection and  transportation features of QD films imparts electro luminescent  (EL) devices with a peak EQE of   $11.6\\%$  , which is the most efficient perovskite QLED achieved by colloidal   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD emitters through wet-chemistry synthesized methods up to now.  The proposed low-cost strategy for synthesizing high-quality  QDs demonstrates promising applications in future novel highdefinition displays and high-quality lightings.  \n\nvolume ethyl acetate before being re-dispersed into toluene or  octane.  \n\nThe micro structure of QDs formed via this RT method is  compared with those formed via the conventional HI method  as shown in Figure 1b,c. First, the QDs exhibit a uniform and  cubic morphology with a crystal size of about   $10\\ \\mathrm{nm}\\ \\mathrm{as}$   shown  in Figure 1b, which is similar to HI products. Second, the QDs  have good crystal lin it y, even single crystal lin it y, as evidenced  by the clear lattice fringe (Figure 1c). The inter planar distance  of (100) is   $0.58\\ \\mathrm{nm}$  , exhibiting a monoclinic phase structure,  which is further confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs (monoclinic PDF# 18-0364) presented  in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). These results demonstrate that QDs synthesized at RT have a near-perfect crystalline  quality, which is highly desired for subsequent fabrication of  op to electronic devices.  \n\nThe “ideal” emitters,   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs, are synthesized by several synergistic short ligands, as depicted in  Figure   1 . Figure 1a  illustrates the synthesis of QDs carried out by a simple and  facile process without inert gas at RT. We utilize toluene to  dissolve   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$   with TOAB to improve the dissolution ability.  A separate solution, prepared in air by dissolving   $\\mathrm{Cs}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}$   in  OTAc to form a   $C s^{+}$   complex, was added to the first solution.  The dissolution reaction of   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$   and   $C s^{+}$   complex does not  require heating and inert gas. The QDs immediately nucleated  and reacted for 5 min after introducing the   $C s^{+}$  . Then, a certain amount of DDAB was added for 2  min to treat QDs to  improve the PL features and to obtain stable ink. At this point,  the QDs were separated via cent ri fuga tion by adding twofold  \n\nThere are three key points on these synergistic ligands whose  chemical structures are illustrated in Figure 1d, in the context  of the proposed strategy. TOAB only improves the dissolution  ability of   $\\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$  , but does not act as a ligand on the QD surface due to the large steric effect, which is confirmed by the N  \n\nthe treated QDs can be easily dispersed and  form the stable ink to be stored for 1 month.  Thus, the purified QD inks exhibit a nearunity PLQY of   $93\\;\\pm\\;2.5\\%$  , a PL peak centered at   $515\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$  , and an FWHM of   $18\\,\\mathrm{\\nm}$    (Figure 1f, inset; Figure S7, Supporting Information), similar to those synthesized using  the HI method. Importantly, the PLQY of QD  inks is clearly higher than that of previous  reports on RT synthesized QDs.  At the  same time, the PL decay of the   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QDs  evolves to single-exponential decay with the  best value for goodness-of-fit   $(\\chi^{2})$  , i.e.,   $\\chi^{2}=$    0.986 (Figure  1f).  The combination of  PLQY and PL decay dynamics confirms that   $\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}{\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD inks can achieve near-unity radiative decay in their excited states in a single  channel. Consequently, the intrinsic decay  channel of the excited states of   ${\\mathrm{Cs}\\mathrm{Pb}\\mathrm{Br}}_{3}$   QD  inks can be nearly completely radiated, which  is expected to construct high-performance  QLEDs.  \n\n![](https://imgbed.siat-mic.com/i/2024/08/17/0a2fb6f4762dbcfa56116aa24a31a38460fc2c825471f2cb19c92073baf467ee-1723833204\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role":
