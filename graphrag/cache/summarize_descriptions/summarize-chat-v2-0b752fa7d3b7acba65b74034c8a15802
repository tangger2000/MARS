{"result": "MORPHOLOGY refers to the shape and structure of the perovskite material, specifically characterizing the physical structure of Pb-Sn halide perovskite films. This morphology is crucial in determining the material's optoelectronic properties and its performance in applications such as solar cells and photodetectors. The study of MORPHOLOGY in these perovskite films often involves the use of techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the nanoscale features, which are essential for understanding the material's structural integrity and its impact on device functionality. Current trends in materials science place significant emphasis on controlling the morphology of perovskite materials to enhance their stability and efficiency in various technological applications.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
