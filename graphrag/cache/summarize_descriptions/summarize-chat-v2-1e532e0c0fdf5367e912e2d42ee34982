{"result": "The Electron Transport Layer (ETL) is a critical component in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), designed to facilitate the movement of electrons from the perovskite layer to the electrode. It has been modified with rubidium fluoride (RbF) to enhance its electron transport properties, ensuring efficient charge extraction and thereby improving the overall performance of the solar cell. This layer is essential for the effective functioning of the solar cell by minimizing recombination losses and optimizing the charge transport process. Characterization techniques such as electron microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy are often employed to assess the quality and properties of the ETL, ensuring that it provides an optimal interface between the perovskite layer and the electrode. The modification with RbF aligns with current trends in materials science aimed at improving the efficiency and stability of next-generation photovoltaic technologies.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
