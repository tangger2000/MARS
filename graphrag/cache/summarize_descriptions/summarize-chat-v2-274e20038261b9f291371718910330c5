{"result": "External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) is a critical metric in materials science used to assess the performance of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, photodetectors, and LEDs. It quantifies the device's efficiency in converting photons to electrons, providing insight into the device's ability to harness light energy effectively. In the context of the flexible SNO film photodetectors (PDs), EQE serves as a figure of merit, indicating the conversion efficiency of these devices. Similarly, for photovoltaic solar cells (PVSCs), EQE is a measure of their proficiency in transforming incident photons into electrical current. The measurement of EQE is essential for characterizing the performance of solar cells and is indicative of the efficiency of LEDs in converting electrical power into light. This parameter is determined under specific synthesis conditions and is crucial for evaluating the optoelectronic properties of the materials used. Characterization techniques that include EQE measurements are vital for understanding the photovoltaic and photoelectric conversion efficiencies, addressing current challenges in enhancing the performance of optoelectronic devices.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
