{"result": "Relative humidity is an environmental condition meticulously controlled during materials testing to assess the stability and properties of materials under varying atmospheric moisture levels. It refers to the humidity level present in the storage environment, which significantly impacts the stability of materials by influencing their physical and chemical characteristics. Relative humidity is defined as the amount of water vapor in the air relative to the maximum amount it could hold at a given temperature, and its precise control is essential for understanding how materials behave in different climatic conditions. This parameter is crucial for the development and characterization of materials, as it can affect their performance in real-world applications, and is often measured using various techniques to ensure accurate environmental simulation during research and development processes.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
