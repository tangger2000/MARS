{"result": "The concept of \"built-in potential\" refers to a characteristic found in certain photovoltaic materials, which enables them to produce an electrical voltage upon exposure to light. This phenomenon is pivotal in the functionality of devices such as solar cells. The built-in potential is influenced by the condition used to enhance its magnitude, which may involve adjusting the composition or structure of the material layers within the device. Specifically, in the context of perovskite solar cells, the built-in potential is determined by the potential difference between the perovskite layer and the Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2',7,7'-Tetrapyridyl-5,5'-diyl bis(2-thienyl) ether) layer, which are critical components affecting the cell's overall performance and efficiency. The accurate measurement and optimization of this potential difference are essential for improving the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells, and researchers often employ various characterization techniques to study these layers and their interfaces to enhance device performance.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
