{"result": "The entities \"100°C\" refer to the specific temperature utilized in the synthesis and processing of quantum dot ensemble solid-state lighting (QD ESLs) and perovskite films. In the context of the provided descriptions, 100°C is the temperature at which the QD ESLs were treated, as well as the temperature for annealing perovskite precursor films that incorporate the DFPDA additive. Annealing at this temperature is critical for the structural rearrangement and crystallization of the perovskite films, which can enhance material properties such as photoluminescence efficiency and film stability. This thermal treatment process is essential for achieving the desired optoelectronic characteristics of the materials, which are of significant interest for applications in optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Characterization techniques following such thermal treatments would typically include photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to assess the quality and phase purity of the films, respectively. The use of 100°C in these processes reflects a balance between promoting the desired material properties and avoiding excessive thermal degradation that could compromise the materials' performance.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
