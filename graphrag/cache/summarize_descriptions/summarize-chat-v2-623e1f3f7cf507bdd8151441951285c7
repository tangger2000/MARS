{"result": "Doping is a technique employed in materials science to optimize the performance of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) by introducing impurities into a semiconductor material. This process alters the electrical properties of the semiconductor, enabling enhanced charge transport and improved device efficiency. By carefully controlling the type and concentration of dopants, researchers can tailor the material's electronic characteristics to suit specific photovoltaic applications. The introduction of these impurities can lead to changes in the material's band structure, affecting its optoelectronic properties, which is crucial for the advancement of next-generation solar cell technologies.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
