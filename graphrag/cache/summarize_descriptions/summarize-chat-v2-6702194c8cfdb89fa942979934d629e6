{"result": "The entities \"300°C\" refer to the specific temperature utilized in the synthesis process of materials, particularly in the context of calcination. In materials science, calcination is a critical thermal treatment step that involves heating a substance to a high temperature to induce a phase transformation, remove volatile components, or increase purity. At 300°C, the precipitate is subjected to calcination, which in the case of coated nanocrystals (NCs), facilitates the formation of a TiO2 shell. This temperature is chosen for its effectiveness in stabilizing the material's structure and enhancing its properties, such as increasing the crystallinity of the TiO2 shell. The calcination process at 300°C is essential for the production of core-shell structures with potential applications in areas such as photovoltaics, catalysis, and environmental remediation, where the properties of the TiO2 shell, including its thickness and phase, are crucial for the material's performance. Characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are often employed post-calcination to confirm the successful formation of the TiO2 shell and to assess its structural and morphological properties.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
