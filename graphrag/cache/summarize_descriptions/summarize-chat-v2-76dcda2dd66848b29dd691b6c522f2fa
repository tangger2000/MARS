{"result": "s\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a powerful characterization technique employed to examine the morphology of CsPbBr3/TiO2 core/shell nanocrystals (NCS). This method allows for detailed visualization of the structural features of the core/shell NCs, providing insights into their size, shape, and the integrity of the core/shell interface. The TEM observations have been instrumental in confirming the successful synthesis of CSPBBR3/TIO2 CORE/SHELL NCS, which are of interest for their enhanced photophysical properties and potential applications in optoelectronic devices. The core/shell structure, with CsPbBr3 as the perovskite core and TiO2 as the shell, is designed to improve stability and photostability, which are critical for practical applications. The TEM analysis is crucial for verifying the synthesis process and for understanding the quantum confinement effects that may arise due to the nanoscale dimensions of the core/shell NCs.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
