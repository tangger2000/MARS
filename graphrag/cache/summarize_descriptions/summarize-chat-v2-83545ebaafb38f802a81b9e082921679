{"result": "SEM IMAGE refers to a Scanning Electron Microscopy image, a technique widely employed in materials science to study the surface morphology of materials. This imaging method provides detailed observations of the material's surface structure at high magnification, enabling researchers to analyze the morphology of materials such as the cross-sections of perovskite devices. SEM is particularly useful for characterizing the topographical features of materials, which is critical for understanding their properties and potential applications in various technologies. The SEM technique involves scanning the sample surface with a focused beam of electrons and detecting the emitted signals to generate an image, thereby providing insights into the material's surface composition and topography.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
