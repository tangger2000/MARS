{"result": "ACETONE is a widely utilized organic solvent in materials science, recognized for its effectiveness as a cleaning agent. It is employed for the thorough cleaning of ITO-coated glass substrates, which is crucial for the removal of contaminants that could affect the integrity of subsequent processes. ACETONE is also used for the sonication of ITO substrates, aiding in the dispersion of particles and ensuring a uniform surface. Its solvent properties extend to cleaning ITO/PET films, maintaining the quality of the film's surface. ACETONE plays a pivotal role in the precipitation of nanocrystals (NCs) from solution, facilitating their isolation from the supernatant. Additionally, it is utilized in the cleaning process of patterned substrates, ensuring that the substrates are free from residues that might interfere with the desired material properties or the performance of the final device. The versatility of ACETONE in these applications underscores its importance in the preparation and processing stages of materials science research.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
