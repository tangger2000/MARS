{"result": "Lattice distortion is a critical property observed in perovskite solar cells, wherein the crystal lattice of the perovskite films undergoes structural changes. This distortion is not only a characteristic feature of the material but also a condition that can lead to the formation of defects in HE (high entropy) oxides. The altered lattice structure in perovskite films can significantly impact the material's optoelectronic properties, which is of great importance for the efficiency of solar cells. The distortion may arise due to various synthesis conditions and plays a pivotal role in the material's performance, as it can either promote or mitigate defect formation, thereby affecting the overall quality and functionality of the oxide materials. Advanced characterization techniques, such as X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy, are employed to study these distortions and understand their implications on the material's electronic and structural properties.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
