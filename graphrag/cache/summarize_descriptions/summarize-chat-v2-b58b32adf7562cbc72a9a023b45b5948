{"result": "THERMAL STABILITY is a critical property of materials that describes their ability to maintain structural integrity and functional characteristics at high temperatures. It is a defining attribute for materials such as CsPbBr3@PSZ composites and PVSCs (Perovskite Solar Cells), where it is imperative for the material to resist changes in its structure and properties over time when exposed to elevated temperatures. This property is essential for ensuring the long-term performance and reliability of these materials in high-temperature applications, such as in the case of PVSCs where thermal stability contributes to their ability to maintain efficiency over the course of their operational lifetime. The assessment of thermal stability often involves the use of various characterization techniques, which help in understanding the material's behavior under thermal stress and are crucial for optimizing synthesis processes and material design.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
