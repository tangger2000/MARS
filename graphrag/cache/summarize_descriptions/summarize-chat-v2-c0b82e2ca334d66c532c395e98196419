{"result": "quantum dots (QDs), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a powerful instrument utilized in materials science to observe the surface characteristics of various materials, including $\\\\mathrm{NH_{4}B r}$ and $\\\\mathrm{CsPbBr_{3}}$ QDs. SEM is not only employed to ascertain the thickness and uniformity of film layers but also plays a critical role in examining the device configuration and morphology of perovskite films. This technique provides high-resolution images, enabling researchers to study the surface topography and structural details of the materials, which is essential for understanding their properties and optimizing their performance in optoelectronic devices.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
