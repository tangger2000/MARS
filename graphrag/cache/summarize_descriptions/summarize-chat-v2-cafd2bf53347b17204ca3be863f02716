{"result": "DETERGENT is a cleaning agent employed in materials science applications, specifically for the sonication of indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. It is utilized to clean both unpatterned and patterned substrates, ensuring the removal of contaminants that could affect the integrity of the substrates' surface. This process is crucial for the preparation of substrates prior to the deposition of thin films or the application of other materials, as it helps to achieve a clean and uniform surface that can enhance the adhesion and performance of subsequent layers or coatings. The use of sonication in conjunction with the detergent aids in the effective removal of particles and residues through cavitation, which is the formation and collapse of air bubbles in the cleaning solution. This method is consistent with current trends in materials processing, where surface preparation is recognized as a key factor in the quality and functionality of the final product.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
