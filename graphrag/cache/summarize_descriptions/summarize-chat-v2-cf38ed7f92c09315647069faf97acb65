{"result": "Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates serve as a foundational layer for fabricating various devices, including those used in photovoltaic applications such as perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These substrates are prized for their excellent transparency and electrical conductivity, making them an ideal choice for optoelectronic devices. The precise synthesis of ITO films typically involves sputtering or chemical solution deposition techniques, where the thickness and quality of the film are crucial to the performance of the final device. In the context of PSCs, ITO substrates provide a stable and conductive platform for the deposition of perovskite layers, enabling efficient charge transport and collection. Characterization of ITO substrates often includes techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to assess film morphology and surface roughness, which are critical for the quality of the subsequent layers in the device stack. The use of ITO substrates in PSCs aligns with current trends in materials science aimed at enhancing the efficiency and stability of next-generation solar cells.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
