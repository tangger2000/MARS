{"result": "Titanium dioxide (TIO2) serves as a critical shell material in the creation of core/shell structures, notably employed to envelop cesium lead bromide nanocrystals (CsPbBr3 NCs). In this application, TIO2 provides a protective layer that can enhance the stability of the nanocrystals against environmental factors such as moisture and heat. The synthesis of TIO2 shells around CsPbBr3 NCs typically involves precise coating techniques to ensure uniformity and to maintain the quantum confinement effects of the nanocrystals, which are essential for their photophysical properties. Characterization of these core/shell structures often includes techniques like transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to assess the shell thickness, uniformity, and crystallographic phase of the TIO2 layer. This material system is of significant interest in the field of optoelectronics, particularly for applications in solar cells and light-emitting diodes, where the stability and photonic properties of the nanocrystals are paramount.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
