{"result": "OPTICAL ABSORPTION is a critical property of perovskite films that signifies their capacity to absorb light, which is fundamental to their performance in optoelectronic devices. This property is meticulously measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer, a technique that provides detailed information about the film's interaction with light across different wavelengths. The perovskite films' optical absorption characteristics are essential for applications such as solar cells, where high absorption coefficients are desirable for efficient conversion of sunlight into electricity. The measurement process helps in understanding the material's bandgap and its potential for use in specific technological applications, contributing to the advancement of materials science and engineering by addressing current challenges in developing high-performance photovoltaic materials.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
