{"result": "ISOPROPANOL is utilized as a cleaning agent in the preparation of materials science samples, specifically for the purification of indium tin oxide (ITO) on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films. It is employed to remove contaminants from the ITO substrates, ensuring a clean surface that is essential for achieving optimal film properties and performance in subsequent applications. The use of ISOPROPANOL in this context is critical for the quality control of the ITO/PET interface, which can affect the device's functionality in optoelectronic technologies such as solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
