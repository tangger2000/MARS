{"result": "MESOPOROUS SiO2 is a material characterized by a highly porous structure, which is utilized as a substrate for hosting Pb-Sn halide perovskite films. Its unique porosity allows for effective integration with the perovskite layer, enhancing the performance of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells. In addition to its role as a substrate, MESOPOROUS SiO2 is also employed in the electron transporting layer of solar cells, contributing to the efficient charge separation and transport within the device. The material's properties make it suitable for improving the stability and efficiency of solar cells, aligning with current trends in photovoltaic technology that seek to optimize material interfaces and electron transport layers for higher energy conversion rates. The synthesis of MESOPOROUS SiO2 typically involves sol-gel processes or template-based methods, which can be fine-tuned to control pore size and structure for specific applications. Characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis are commonly used to assess the material's porosity and surface area, which are critical for its function in solar cell technology.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
