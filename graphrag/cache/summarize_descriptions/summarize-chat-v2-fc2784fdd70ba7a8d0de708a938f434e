{"result": "NON RADIATIVE RECOMBINATION is a phenomenon in materials science, particularly relevant to the field of photovoltaics, wherein charge carriers recombine without emitting photons. This process results in the loss of energy within the solar cell, as the recombination of excited carriers occurs without the emission of light. It is a critical factor to consider in the efficiency of solar cells, as it signifies a non-productive pathway for the conversion of sunlight into electricity. The process is characterized by the recombination of charge carriers, such as electrons and holes, that do not result in the emission of light, which is in contrast to radiative recombination where photons are emitted. This non-radiative mechanism is often studied using various characterization techniques to understand its impact on material performance and to develop strategies to minimize its occurrence in solar cell materials.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
