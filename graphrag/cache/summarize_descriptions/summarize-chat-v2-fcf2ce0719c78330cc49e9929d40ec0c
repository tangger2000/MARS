{"result": "JSC, or short-circuit current density, is a critical parameter in assessing the performance of perovskite solar cells. It quantifies the solar cell's current output under short-circuit conditions, representing the maximum current that can be obtained from the photovoltaic solar cell (PVSC) when the external circuit resistance is zero. This measure is essential for evaluating the efficiency and potential of perovskite devices in converting solar energy into electrical power. The short-circuit current is influenced by the material properties of the perovskite layer and is often characterized using various techniques to understand its photovoltaic characteristics and optimize device performance.", "input": "You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials.
