# Materials Science Claim Extraction Prompt

## Target Activity
You are an intelligent assistant that helps a materials scientist to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a scientific document related to materials synthesis and characterization.

## Goal
Given a scientific document that is potentially relevant to materials science, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.

## Steps
1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types. In the context of materials science, entities may include:
   - Chemical compounds (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, PbBr2)
   - Solvents (e.g., DMF, toluene)
   - Synthesis methods (e.g., LARP, hot-injection)
   - Characterization techniques (e.g., XRD, TEM)
   - Material properties (e.g., bandgap, quantum yield)
   - Equipment or instruments (e.g., spectrophotometer, centrifuge)

2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.
For each claim, extract the following information:
   - Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that is involved in or affected by the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.
   - Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either interacts with, is produced by, or is affected by the subject entity in the context of the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.
   - Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type. Examples in materials science context:
     - SYNTHESIS ROLE
     - MATERIAL PROPERTY
     - CHARACTERIZATION METHOD
     - REACTION MECHANISM
     - PERFORMANCE METRIC
   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be false, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified or is hypothetical.
   - Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references. Include specific details such as:
     - Synthesis conditions (temperature, pressure, time)
     - Concentration or ratios of reagents
     - Observed properties or characteristics
     - Relationship to other materials or processes
   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made or the research was conducted. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.
   - Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim. Include full sentences to provide context.

Format each claim as (<subject_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<object_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_type>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_status>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_start_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_end_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_description>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_source>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

## Examples
Example 1:
Entity specification: PbBr2, n-octylamine
Claim description: roles and processes in quantum dots synthesis
Text: The LARP synthesis is accomplished by simply mixing a solution of CH3NH3PbBr3 precursors in good solvent (N-dimethylformamide, DMF) into a vigorously stirred poor solvent (toluene, hexane, etc.) with longchain organic ligands, which subsequently result in the controlled crystallization of precursors into colloidal nanoparticles. Figure 1 schematically illustrates the typical fabrication process of the LARP technique. In a typical synthesis of CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs, a mixture of PbBr2, CH3NH3Br, n-octylamine, and oleic acid was dissolved into DMF to form a clear precursor solution. In the precursor solution, DMF acts as a good solvent to dissolve the inorganic salts and small molecules.
