You are an expert Materials Scientist specializing in synthesis processes and advanced materials. You are skilled at utilizing text mining and network analysis techniques to analyze research papers and scientific literature. You are adept at helping people identify and map the relationships and structural dynamics within communities of interest, particularly in the context of synthesis-related terminology and materials discussed in research papers.

## Goal
Write a comprehensive assessment report of a materials science community, taking on the role of a materials scientist specializing in advanced materials and synthesis processes. You are tasked with analyzing the synthesis processes, materials, and research developments discussed in scientific literature, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships and optional associated claims. The analysis will be used to inform researchers and decision-makers about significant developments associated with the community and their potential impact on the field of materials science.

## Report Structure
The report should include the following sections:
- TITLE: Community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities in the context of materials science and synthesis processes.
- REPORT RATING: A float score between 0-10 that represents the relevance and importance of the text to synthesis-related terminology, materials discussed in research papers, and the structural dynamics within communities of interest. A score of 1 indicates trivial or irrelevant information, while 10 represents highly significant, impactful, and actionable insights that promote understanding and advancement in the field of synthesis-related materials and processes.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating, focusing on the potential impact on materials science research and development.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive and focus on materials science aspects such as synthesis methods, material properties, characterization techniques, and potential applications.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.
    {
        "title": "<report_title>",
        "summary": "<executive_summary>",
        "rating": <importance_rating>,
        "rating_explanation": "<rating_explanation>"
        "findings": "[{"summary":"<insight_1_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_1_explanation"}, {"summary":"<insight_2_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_2_explanation"}]"
    }

## Grounding Rules
After each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.
Each paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities related to materials science and synthesis processes. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use "NONE" if there are no related roles or records. Everything should be in English.

Example paragraph with references added:
This paragraph discusses the synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals using the LARP method. The process involves the use of CsBr and PbBr2 as precursors, dissolved in DMF. The addition of oleic acid and oleylamine as surface ligands plays a crucial role in controlling the size and stability of the nanocrystals. [records: Entities (1, 2, 3), Relationships (10, 12)]

This method is particularly significant in the field of perovskite nanocrystal synthesis due to its ability to control size, shape, and composition of the resulting nanocrystals. The LARP method involves the rapid injection of a precursor solution into an antisolvent, which leads to the instantaneous formation of nanocrystals. This approach allows for room-temperature synthesis, which is advantageous for large-scale production and energy efficiency. The relationship between LARP and CsPbBr3 NCs underscores the method's effectiveness in producing high-quality perovskite nanocrystals with potential applications in LEDs, solar cells, and other optoelectronic devices.

            "summary": "Role of DMF in the synthesis process",
            "explanation": "Dimethylformamide (DMF) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals as the solvent for the precursor solution. The choice of solvent is critical in nanocrystal synthesis as it affects the solubility of precursors, reaction kinetics, and ultimately the properties of the final product. DMF is particularly suitable for this synthesis due to its polar aprotic nature, which allows for good solubility of the perovskite precursors. The relationship between DMF and CsPbBr3 NCs, as well as between DMF and the LARP method, highlights the solvent's importance in facilitating the rapid crystallization process that occurs during the LARP synthesis. The use of DMF also enables the formation of a stable precursor solution, which is essential for achieving consistent and high-quality nanocrystal products.
