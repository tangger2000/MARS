Synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs
As illustrated in Figure S1, the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs was carried out at room temperature by the LARP approach, through injection of 1 mL of precursor mixture into 10 mL of toluene under vigorous stirring (Figure S1b). The precursor was prepared by mixing CsBr (0.4 mmol), PbBr2 (0.4 mmol), oleylamine (OLA, 0.5 mL), and oleic acid (OA, 1 mL) in DMF (10 mL) (Figure S1a). Both DMF and toluene were dried from any remaining traces of water prior to use (DMF by adding KnNa12 n[(AlO2)12(SiO2)12], and toluene via distillation). When investigating the influence of water added to the "bad solvent", 1 mL of the dry precursor was injected into a mixture of toluene and water (10 mL + x μL, 0≤x≤60) (Figure S1c). When investigating the influence of water added to the precursor, 1 mL solution taken from the mixture of 1 mL dry precursor and x μL (0≤x≤60) water was injected into dry toluene (Figure S1d).

## Example 3
Input text:
The CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs were obtained via a modified super saturated recrystallization method at room temperature. CsBr and PbBr2, as selected ion sources, were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were then added as surface ligands, followed by a rapid injection into toluene. Upon the injection into the antisolvent of toluene, CsPbBr3 NCs were formed immediately, as shown in Figure 1a. Then Zr(OC4H9)4 was injected into the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs solution to form ZrO2 coating onto the NCs surface. The whole synthesis process was carried out at room temperature in air without extra inert gas and incorporation of water.

1) The hydrolysis reaction of the precursor with water in the air is suggested as follows:
Zn(OC4H9)4+2H2O→Zr(OH)2(OC4H9)2+2C4H9OH

2) At the same time, the condensation reaction of the precursor is as follows:
Zr·OH+OH·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+H2O
Zr·OC4H9+HO·Zr→·Zr·O·Zr·+C4H9OH

Synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs: PbBr2 (0.4 mmol) and CsBr (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL DMF. OAm (0.2 mL) and OA (0.6 mL) were added into the above precursor to act as the stabilizer. Then 0.5 mL of the precursor solution was quickly added into toluene (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 1500 rpm for 10s.

Synthesis of CsPbBr3@ZrO2 NCs: Different amount of Zr(OC4H9)4 (0, 60 µmol) were injected into CsPbBr3 NCs toluene solution (5 mL) and then vigorous vibrated for 10s. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 5 min to obtain the precipitates. Then the precipitates were re-dispersed and preserved in toluene. All the above experiments were carried out at room temperature in air.
